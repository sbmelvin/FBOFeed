<CONTACT>Jacquelyn M. Fleet, Phone 315-330-3270, Email jacquelyn.fleet@rl.af.mil
<DESC><p>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Servicer Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, with HP Federal Relocation Team, Hewlett Packard Company, 6600 Rockledge Drive, Suite 150, Bethesda, MD 20815 for the relocation of AFRL/RIOS Storage Area Network (SAN) equipment. The relocation is due to the RIOS Data Center which supports AFRL/RRS Enterprise services being required to move from one building to another.
<p>Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 541519.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification:</p>
<p>Due to the maintenance support obligation between HP and the Government regarding existing physical and logical configuration of AFRL/RIOS' HP SAN storage, server, and fibre-channel networking equipment, HP Federal Relocation Services is the only source that can reconfigure and move our SAN from one (1) location to another location. If RIOS or another third party were to move the SAN equipment and any part of it became damaged or non-functional, HP may void RIOS' support agreement which would cause extensive downtime of critical SAN storage and server resources and require additional monies to be expended to repair and then re-certify the fixed configuration with HP. Repair outside of warranty or replacement would cause significant disruption to the government's schedule and require unnecessary cost.</p>

Day two will be used to meet individually with potential prime contractors who request a one-on-one session with the Government.  One-on-one sessions will be made by appointment and last no more than 1 hour. The Government will only provide information during these sessions that is equally available to all interested parties.  Following Day 2, the collective answers provided during the one-on-one sessions will be posted on the TSAT SE&I Bidders Library website.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for two CDG-4000 Countdown Generators.   NASA/KSCintends to purchase these items from DGM Electronics, Inc 13654 Metric Road Roscoe, IL61073 for the following reasons:DGM Electronics Inc countdown generators are required for interoperability with otherexisting countdown systems, already existing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).  Thereforecontinued use of this brand as opposed to another brand will greatly reduce the costassociated with the acquisition of spare parts and spare/backup controllers.  Restricted competition for only DGM Electronics brand name equipment is required for userfamiliarity.  All engineers, field systems specialists, and technicians have been trainedto setup, operate, diagnose, troubleshoot, and repair the aforementioned equipment. Introducing different models create the need for training for all users.  Also, differentconfigurations at different locations lead to increased difficulty and longer troubleresolution times.The continued requirement for specific brand name communications equipment is alsonecessary for operational compatibility.  The brand name countdown generators identifiedabove will be installed in remote locations that are unmanned.	Introducing a newcountdown generators model may result in an inability of the current system.  Anydevelopment effort will be a direct cost increase, or alternatively an additionalcountdown generator system must be purchased, not only increasing cost, but complicatingoperations as well.Finally, the varying input and output formats available from the DGM Electronics IncCDG-4000 are required to meet the diverse community of countdown time stakeholders atKSC, the Eastern Range and the various remote locations supporting the Launch ControlSystem.  The CDG-4000 has a history of successful use in the timing systems of both KSCand the ER; therefore guaranteeing compatibility between LCS, KSC and the ER.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with GFS Chemicals, Inc, of Powell, Ohio, for the acquisition of 1 kg Lot of Zinc Oxide Precursor Powder to be used in the Ceramics Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

*** Sole source determination is based on the need for specific chemical and microstructural features which must be of a highly specific character.  Lacking these specific features, the SRM, into which a substantial research effort has been expended, will fail.  The process required to produce powder of the desired character and of sufficient quantity requires the use of a fixed element flow reactor technology developed at NIST.  The use of the flow reactor to produce the materials of the required character will require several iterations to determine the necessary operational parameters.  GFS Chemicals is uniquely qualified to produce the required powder.  GFS Chemicals, Incorporated, is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required Zinc Oxide Precursor Powder.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 325199, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by August 26, 2008 will be considered by the Government.

Offerors shall include a completed copy of 52.212-3 and its ALT I and 252.212-7000 with quotes. All clauses shall be incorporated by reference in the order. 
Past Performance:  The offeror shall submit, as part of its quote, information on a maximum of three previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the Item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.  Information shall be limited to the contract number, name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and the name, (phone number and email address) of a contact for each contract listed.  The offeror should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them.  The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the offeror.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other offerors.  The offeror should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the offerors past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ. The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ. 
The Contracting Officer may decide not to evaluate the technical proposal of an offeror whose total evaluated price is higher than the total evaluated price of another proposal rated technically acceptable or higher and the Contracting Officer determines that any possible technical superiority of the offeror's proposal would not warrant the price premium of the offeror's proposal and that, therefore, the offeror's proposal could not be the best value.
Unrealistically low prices, as determined by the Contracting Officer, may be considered in risk assessment and the offerors overall proposal may be downgraded.
Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award.  Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/.  All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, business size, and payment terms. 
This announcement will close at 1400 EST (2:00pm Philadelphia, PA) on 26 August 2008.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  Quotes can be submitted via mail or email. Quotes are limited to 4 pages (1 page for each contract reference for past performance, and 1 page for pricing information).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:joseph.morse@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Research Triangle Park</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, RTP Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, is issuing a DRAFT Program Announcement (PA), W911NF-08-R-0012, for the Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA).  The purpose of this United States Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA) Program Announcement (PA) is to solicit offers that will help fulfill the research and development goals of the U.S. Department of the Army.  The objective of the Alliance is to conduct research creating the technical foundation supporting development of future autonomous unmanned systems. To achieve this objective the Alliance will advance fundamental science and technology in several key areas including the ability of unmanned systems to sense and fully understand the local environment in terms of both features and activities; the ability to interact intelligently with the surroundings to successfully conduct meaningful activity; individually or as part of a team, to readily adapt to changing situations and to learn from prior experience; the ability to be integrated safely and successfully into human activity; the ability to dexterously manipulate objects in a human-like fashion and to maneuver unfettered in cluttered, complex environments.  The Army envisions the Alliance will bring together government, industrial, and academic institutions to address research and development required to enable the deployment of future military unmanned ground vehicle systems ranging in size from man-portables to ground combat vehicles.  The DRAFT Robotics CTA PA has been posted at the Robotics CTA website: www.arl.army.mil/robotics.  This PA will result in the award of two instruments:  (1) a cooperative agreement as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for the execution of the Fundamental Research Component; and (2) a procurement contract as defined in 31 U.S.C. 6303 for the execution of the Technology Transition Component.  The cooperative agreement for the Fundamental Research Component will be awarded to a Consortium of academic and industrial organizations.  To assure the creation of a well focused research program, the consortium will be kept small, ideally with no more than six members.  The Consortium must include an HBCU/MI Member(s) that will participate substantially in the research effort and receive at least 10% of the funding for the Fundamental Research Component.  The consortium will be led by an organization that will be charged with spearheading the technology integration and technology transition efforts. This organization will be designated as the Integration Lead Organization (ILO) and its CTA activities shall be conducted in the United States.  There will be no limitation to the place of performance for other organizations participating in the Consortium.  The procurement contract will be awarded to the ILO for the Consortium.  Planned funding levels for the cooperative agreement are set forth in the Robotics PA.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the Robotics consortium for five years with an option for an additional five years.  An Opportunity Conference will be conducted on Wednesday, 27 August 2008, at Sheraton Imperial Hotel in Research Triangle Park, NC. The purpose of the Opportunity Conference is to provide potential offerors with technical and business information concerning the Robotics CTA and to provide an opportunity for potential offerors to discuss the Robotics CTA with Government personnel.  Details concerning registration and logistics associated with the Opportunity Conference can be found at: http://www.armyuniversityopportunities.com/.  All presentations provided at the Opportunity Conference will be posted subsequently on the Robotics CTA website.  In addition, all questions and answers resulting from the conference that do not include proprietary information will be posted on the Robotics CTA website.  Interested offerors are strongly encouraged to thoroughly review the DRAFT Robotics CTA PA prior to attending the Opportunity Conference.  Further, ARL will be hosting an Open House for the Robotics CTA at its Ft. Indiantown Gap, PA Robotics Research Facility on 23 October 2008.  More information on the Open House can be found at the Robotics CTA website.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with RMB Earth Science Consultants, 327 Rosehill Wynd, Delta British Columbia, Canada to perform absorption isotherms analyses on twenty (20) coals samples.
The proposed action is for services for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy the agency's requirement.  The following Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition:
The US Geological Survey has a requirement for high pressure methane adsorption isotherm analysis to estimate the gas storage capacity of low rank coals in coalfields in the U.s. and worldwide.
Measurement of the gas storage capacity of the low rank coals is a priority investigation of the Energy program. Assessment of the gas includes strict deadlines for creating and supplying data required in the calculation of coalbed gas to cooperating government agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management and Philippine Department of Energy (DOE). 
Adsorption isotherm analysis is necessary to interpret how much volume of gas is adsorbed in pore system in the coal, to develop theories as to the origin, saturation, and distribution of coalbed gas in order to estimate coalbed gas resources. This analysis requires a consistent methodology and strict adherence to procedures established and maintained by the American Society of Testing and Materials. 
More importantly, RMB has analyzed and established a protocol for countless low rank coal samples submitted by other customers. RMB experience in treating these low rank coal samples for isotherm analysis in their laboratory is required to get accurate measurements. In addition, the USGS has contracted with RMB before to do similar analysis and this analytical relationship provides familiarity of analyzing the samples as well as provides a historical analytical continuity and consistency of methodology permitting reliable data collection. 
Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services described above are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar services must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the services identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.     (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

<SUBJECT>70--Sentillion Vault Replacement

<CONTACT>Brian Steensland

<a href="mailto:brian.steensland@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>Sentillion Vault ReplacementJUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONApplication For Brand Name Descriptions (FAR 6.302-1(c)) 1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:Requesting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs				VA Central Office 810 Vermont Avenue NWWashington, DC  20420 Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs				IT Acquisition Center (200/00D3)				1615 Woodward Street				Austin, TX  787722.	Nature and/or description of the action: The purpose of this task is to replace the existing Sentillion Vergence Vault hardware with the current state-of-the-art hardware platform. This acquisition action is planned as a sole source delivery order under the SEWP IV contracts.   New Vault hardware is required to operate version 4.2 of the Sentillion Vergence software on the Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW) Vaults and work-stations.  Clinical Context Object Workgroup is an HL7 standard protocol designed to enable disparate applications to synchronize in real-time, and at the user-interface level. The existing Vault hardware does not interface version 4.2 of the Sentillion Vergence software which is designed to upgrade functionality under the enterprise Sentillion software maintenance support task order V200P-1982.  By upgrading the Vault hardware in order to operate Sentillion software version 4.2, the VA can expect improved performance due to faster equipment and improved reliability and functionality of the upgraded software.  Benefits of moving to Sentillion Vergence software version 4.2 include the following:"	Support for Citrix roaming sessions "	Support for Client to Vault connectivity across a VPN"	Updated operating system to Redhat Enterprise version 4"	Added support for Windows Terminal Server (WTS)"	Added support for multiple administrative accounts"	Added support for AES encryption"	Changed desktop components to run as a service"	Increased system performance to support up to 2,500 concurrent CCOW sessions per Vault"	Improved availability and disaster recovery capabilities"	Improved laptop support for disconnected states and power save modes"	Improved wireless support for intermittent connectivity"	Enhanced Citrix support"	Support for Active Directory password self-reset"	Support for Dell 1950 hardware3.	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):This procurement will allow the VA to purchase and deliver 237 upgraded Vaults to 32 locations.  Once installed and tested by the VA the Sentillion software will be upgraded from version 3.7 to version 4.2.  The estimated value of this equipment procurement is $1,787,500.The Sentillion product is utilized in a wide variety of VA applications to provide CCOW functionality.  Developers have previously received training and assistance in incorporating the Sentillion product into their applications.  Many VA and several COTS applications are currently in production nationally using this functionality:  VistA Kernel and RPC Broker, CPRS (Computerized Patient Record System), BCMA (Bar Code Medication Administration), CCR (Clinical Case Registry), HealtheVet Desktop (aka Care Management), Imaging, VIC (Veterans Id Card), iMed Consent (COTS product), Brit Lite (COTS product).  4.	An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  This acquisition is conducted under the authority of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer and 6.302-1(c), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This acquisition uses a brand name description peculiar to one manufacturer and does not provide for full and open competition. 5.	A Demonstration that the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:The use of Sentillion Vergence software for CCOW functionality is already several years in progress, and is currently involved in development of additional VistA and COTS products. The Sentillion Vergence software is designed to run on specific hardware, i.e., Sentillion Vault hardware.  It is a violation of Sentillion's Vergence licensing and support agreement to run the software on any other hardware.  The VA currently has a task order V200P-1982 for the enterprise Sentillion software maintenance support and hardware maintenance support with option years that provides contract coverage through FY 2010.  It benefits the VA to upgrade the brand name Vault hardware in order to capture all the state of the art functionality under Sentillion software version 4.2 already paid for under V200P-1982 as part of software upgrades.As an alternative, a different solution could be purchased if available; however, a different solution is not available.  A recent Request for Information (RFI) from the SEWP contract yielded only the Sentillion solution for CCOW functionality.  If another product could be found, the new product would require the retraining of developers, create a significant delay of products currently in process, as well as delay current timelines of additional features to current CCOW applications.  Additionally, a bridging mechanism would be needed to allow two CCOW mechanisms to work concurrently - until all applications have been converted to the new product. That mechanism would be very complex to develop and may incur additional delays in the timelines.  The cost for new software and hardware could be as high as $9,771,132.00 with maintenance approximately $1.5 million per year.  This cost is based on the current cost estimates for Sentillion software and hardware obtained through a recent SEWP RFI.  If a new product was found that could replace the Sentillion product, multiple VA GUI applications, such as VA Kernel, Imaging, CPRS, HealtheVet Desktop (aka Care Management), Clinical Case Registry, Vista Web, Veterans ID Card and COTS products such as iMed Consent (and others in process) would have to be rewritten to use the new product.  The minimum cost to initiate the rewriting of the existing applications is estimated at $333,632.00.   The total cost for a new product (if one could be found) could be as high as a total cost of $10,104,764.00 for the base year, plus $1.5 million per year for maintenance for every year thereafter.As stated above, as a result of the recent SEWP RFI, the Sentillion products were the only technical solutions offered that can meet the government's needs6.	A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice was or will be Publicized:This acquisition will be solicited under the National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) Solution Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC), to all SEWP contract holders.  The justification for other than full and open competition will be posted the Government Point of Entry, Federal Business Opportunities (FBO).7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:Pricing shall be determined fair and reasonable based on competitive quotes, as prescribed in FAR 16.505 (b)(1)(iv).Market research has indicated that there are multiple distributors of the required products.  The acquisition will result in a delivery order against a previously competed contract (NASA SEWP IV) which was determined fair and reasonable.8.	A Description of the Market Research Conducted:A Request for Information (RFI) was posted for review by NASA SEWP IV contract holders containing the following language:  "VA seeks market research information on vendors who can provide an enterprise license for an ANSI HL7 Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW) solution.  CCOW is a standard methodology by which clinical context can be managed between different GUI applications running on the same desktop environment.  The CCOW solution must adhere to the HL7 standards.  This solution will allow users to access only the information and systems to which they are authorized."  Only the Sentillion solution was offered as a result of this RFI.9.	Other Facts:  The total estimated cost to pursue competitive offers for the overall solution at this time would consist of the following:Context Management Software - VHA Enterprise License for Clinical Users:	$ 4,000,000.00 User Link Software - VHA Enterprise License for Clinical Users:			$ 3,000,000.00Hardware - 237 Vergence Vaults:						$ 1,787,500.00Standard Implementation:							$    594,000.00 Application Immersions:							$      56,000.00Re-write of existing applications:						$    333,632.00Grand Total:									$9,771,132.0010.	A Listing of the Sources, if any, that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:MPC-G, a NASA SEWP contractor and small business, currently holds the contract for the software maintenance and has expressed interest in continuing the effort.11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition Before any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required:The VA Office of Information Technology has already begun to monitor the market for availability of alternative products that are suitable with VA's infrastructure and offer improved technology.  This alternative would allow for obtaining new software and supporting hardware in a competitive environment with the goal of achieving an overall best value to the Government.12.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">In &ldquo;</span><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">A Strategic Vision for the 21st Century", released in December 2004, the U.S. Government Printing Office(GPO) put forth a plan to digitize all Federal publications back to the earliest days of the republic. The Vision included the development of a Digital Content System, as put forth in plans for FDsys (pronounced F.D.sys, or Fed sys). One of the strategic goals of the Vision is to digitize a complete legacy collection of tangible U.S. Government publications to ensure GPO can provide a &ldquo;no-fee&rdquo; public access to these materials that remain available, in the public domain, for permanent public access.</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: small;"><font face="Times New Roman">The legacy collection of tangible Federal publications consists of approximately 2.2 million titles held in depository library collections located throughout the United States and its territories. The collection consists of publications in many different forms, including books, pamphlets, oversized maps and posters, and microform. Most of the materials that are expected to be digitized in conjunction with this effort are mainly books and pamphlets. Microform (Microfiche) is outside of the scope of this contract. While the overall goal of the project is to digitize the entire collection of Federal publications, GPO may consider a phased approach for the execution of the digitization effort and may have several contractors assisting with the project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"><span style="font-size: small;"><font face="Times New Roman">GPO has set standards for the digitization process. While GPO envisions a relationship where a contractor or contractor(s) provides the actual digitization services for most publications of standard size, GPO may digitize a number of documents in-house (or collaborate with other Federal agencies or Federal Depository Libraries), which may include rare or fragile documents requiring special handling, oversized documents requiring a planetary scanner, or any document requiring &lsquo;rush&rsquo; processing. In addition, GPO envisions a collaborative workflow in which the contractor or contractors could flag specific parts of a publication (e.g., oversized foldouts) that may be digitized by GPO, a Federal agency, or a Federal Depository Library.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"></span></font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">For more than 140 years, the Government Printing Office (GPO) has kept America informed by producing and distributing Federal government information products. GPO combines conventional technology with state-of-the-art methods whether providing public access to Government information online, or producing or procuring printed publications that serve the information needs of the U.S. Congress, Federal agencies and the American public. Established by Congress to ensure that the American public has access to its Government&rsquo;s information, this program involves the acquisition, format conversion, and distribution of depository materials and the coordination of Federal depository libraries in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">The mission of the FDLP is to disseminate information products from all three branches of the Government to over 1,250 libraries nationwide. Libraries that have been designated as Federal depositories will maintain this information product as part of their existing collection and are responsible for assuring that the public has free access to the material provided by the FDLP.</span></p>

FDsys will ingest, preserve, and provide access to the information produced by all three branches of the U.S. Government. The proposed system is envisioned as a comprehensive, systematic, and dynamic means for preserving any type of digital content, independent of specific hardware and/or software. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">FDsys will enable GPO customers to obtain hard copy publications and to electronically access the content they want, and it will enable GPO to deliver that content in the formats its customer&rsquo;s desire. The system is intended to automate many of the content lifecycle processes and make it easier to deliver the content in formats suited to the needs of GPO customers. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Content in FDsys will include all known Federal Government documents, but is specifically targeted to those within the scope of GPO&rsquo;s Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), whether printed or born digital. This content will be entered into the system and then authenticated and catalogued according to GPO metadata and document creation standards. Content may include text and associated graphics, video and sound and other forms of content that emerge. Content will be available for Web searching and Internet viewing, downloading and printing, and as document masters for conventional and on-demand printing, or other dissemination methods. </span></p>

Commerce currently employs the Comprizon.Buy product from CACI Federal, Inc. as the contract writing, contract management and contract information system portion of CSTARS.  This product is based on client-server technology and has ended its COTS product life.  The contract information system portion of this product does not provide robust data collection and reporting which necessitates the EARS application described in paragraphs below.  

Currently there are four production instances of Comprizon.Buy deployed at Commerce.  The fours instances of the application, one each for the Office of the Secretary (OS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Census Bureau.  The Office of Computer Services (OCS) in Springfield, VA hosts acquisition data for Census, OS, and NOAA.  OCS provides each bureau with their own environment that includes a separate instance of the CSTARS application and Oracle database.  Although also using CSTARS, NIST operates and maintains a separate instance at their Gaithersburg, MD offices.  Collectively, this means that CTARS is currently located physically at two locations, Springfield and Gaithersburg.

The objective is to migrate to one production instance servicing all four bureaus.  However, the single instance must interface with three instances of the Core Financial System (CFS) located at Census, in Suitland, MD; NOAA, in Germantown, MD; and NIST, in Gaithersburg, MD.  The NIST instance also services OS.  The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) employs the Momentum finance and procurement system and is not in scope of this new enterprise-wide effort.

Commerce also employs the CACI Comprizon.Request requisitioning system which is still supported by the vendor as a COTS product.  If this system can be retained in the new system, there may be advantages to the Department and this information would be useful to include in a response to this RFI.

While each bureau's data is currently stored in disparate databases, DoC is utilizing a data warehouse solution  Enterprise Acquisition Reporting System (EARS) -- that provides for enterprise-wide reporting capabilities.  EARS employs the SAS Enterprise Business Intelligence (EBI) Suite to create canned and ad hoc procurement reports.  The data for these reports are loaded from an Oracle data warehouse using SAS Extract, Transform & Load (ETL) software.  This provides a more robust query tool than is available from the current Comprizon.Buy system.

While CSTARS is currently implemented in a client/server environment, it utilizes Citrix Metaframe as an application server.  Citrix provides increases system efficiency by shifting most of the processing from the local client to the application server.  All application logic executes on the server and only screen updates (i.e. screen images), mouse movements and keystrokes are transmitted via Citrix.  This reduces the amount of data transferred between the client and server, thus, alleviating potential network bandwidth issues. 

Like all other government agencies, DoC is required to integrate certain components of their acquisition systems with components of the federal Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE).  Information regarding the IAE is available at http://egov.gsa.gov.  At a minimum, the new DOC acquisition system must be interfaced to FedBizOpps, Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and Federal Procurement Data System  Next Generation (FPDS-NG).  The current CACI Comprizon.Buy system currently provides this functionality which must be retained.

Financial Interface

In 2006, the DoC Acquisition community implemented an interface to the DoC financial system, called the Core Financial System (CFS).  This interface is called the Obligation & Requisition Standard Interface (ORSI).  ORSI is designed, developed, deployed as a standard interface between CSTARS and the Departments Core Financial System (CFS).  

ORSI includes an interface for requisitions, obligations, and non-Central Contractor Registration (CCR) vendors. This interface has a major impact on existing procurement and finance business processes at the Bureaus.  

Implementation of ORSI included new processing methods, the elimination of some manual entry, and increased system conformity.  The CSTARS ORSI deployment consisted of separate deployment activities at each of the four Bureaus (Census, NIST, NOAA, and OS) and OCS.  Each of these locations link via existing connections using TIBCO (the Department-wide EAI tool) and Java Messaging Service (JMS) queues.

Pricing Information Request:

INSTRUCTIONS:  Please provide pricing information (in thousands of dollars) for each activity by fiscal year.  Pricing data should be provided over the 10 year lifecycle and the out-years should reflect inflation factors as determined by your pricing model.  

Budget planning is for the system replacement to begin in FY 2010 and be complete by mid FY 2011.  While costs in FY 2010 and FY 2011 may include both non-recurring and recurring costs, it is anticipated that FY 2012 and beyond will be only steady state recurring operation and maintenance costs.  If you reflect non-recurring costs (ilel, planning or acquisition costs) beyond FY 2011, please discuss the rationale in your accompanying narrative.

For budget planning we distinguish between non-recurring costs to deploy the system (Planning Activities and Acquisition Activities) and recurring year-to year costs which represent Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Activities.  You will see some elements such as training in both acquisition and in operations and maintenance.  In this case, training in the acquisition phase is to train the entire workforce on new software, while in the operations and maintenance phase, the concentration is training of new hires.  It is important to keep the concept of segregating recurring from non-recurring costs.

Some O&M activities are not performed annually, such as certification and accreditation (a tri-annual federal requirement) or hardware refresh on a three to five year cycle (depending on your own estimate).  While these are not annual activities, they are considered recurring costs to be reflected in the O&M section because they are not associated directly with deploying the system as opposed to maintaining the system.

Specific pricing information for activities such as Modify Financial Interface or Data Migration will be considered a rough order of magnitude and should be based on experience with other similar Federal agencies and similar understanding.  It would be most helpful to include pricing ranges for those efforts mentioned above along with quality remarks that you would deem to be beneficial in understanding your estimates.  Please also include information regarding which costs would be subcontracted.  These should be provided in a narrative separate from the spreadsheet in a separate MS Word or Adobe Acrobat document.

NOTE:  We recognize that though quality pricing information is being provided on an ESTIMATE ONLY basis, it will not be used for legally binding purposes.  

Following are the descriptions for the price elements to be completed in the spreadsheet.  Where reference are made to additional requested comments, please do not put these in the spreadsheet, but include them in a separate narrative in a Microsoft Word 2003 (or earlier version) or Adobe Acrobat document.

Planning Activities:

The first of three phases of the system lifecycle, planning, means preparing, developing or acquiring the information you will use to design and implement the system. Planning must progress to the point where you are ready to commit to achieving specific goals before preceding to the acquisition phase. Planning activities may include process flow diagrams, data dictionaries, engineering and design studies, and prototypes. 

Process Changes and Data Standardization - This is the cost associated with assistance in identifying necessary process changes and data standardization efforts going from four bureau systems to a single, enterprise-wide acquisition system.

<CONTACT>Rodney Walters, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014431658, Email Rodney.walters@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>The department and Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with David H Gustafson and Associates on a sole source basis to support the direction and supervision of a SAMHSA Process Improvement Initiative. The period of performance is from September 29, 2008 to March 31, 2009.  The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  This procurement is under the Simplified Acquisition threshold and will be awarded as a Simplified Acquisition.  Similar to the work done under the NIATx Model, the Initiative will focus on improving the systems used to organize and conduct work, and at every available opportunity will address the styles and methods of communication used to facilitate work and the arrangements and amenities that house and support work.  The approach to SAMHSAs internal process improvement has been based on the model developed by the Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx), a partnership between the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Paths to Recovery program, SAMHSAs Center for Substance Abuse Treatment's Strengthening Treatment Access and Retention (STAR) program, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and a number of independent addiction treatment organizations. NIATx works with addiction treatment providers to make more efficient use of their capacity and shares strategies for improving treatment access and retention.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government requirement as articulated above.  The notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document is available.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capability statements should be submitted by 12 pm August 26, 2008 to rodney.walters@psc.hhs.gov

<DESC>A. General Information.<BR>The Northeast Region, Mid-Atlantic & Heartland Regions collectively referred to as Logistical Support Area  North, a military integrated delivery network comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, North Carolina,, Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Hand Sanitizers and Compatible Lotions, subsequently referred to Hand Sanitizers/Lotions. The Northeast Region has been designated as the Lead Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) for this standardization action.  Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.  <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the LSA  North on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<BR><BR>The MTFs in the LSA  North include, but are not limited to the following: Northeast Region  Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; Malcolm Grow Medical Center,  Andrews AFB, MD; Naval Health Care New England (Dental Clinic, Occupational Health Services, and  Primary Care Clinic); Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Clinic, FT Meade, MD; Dewitt Health Care System, FT Belvoir, VA; Keller Army Community Hospital, WestPoint, NY; National Naval Medical Center (Dental Clinic), Bethesda, MD. Mid-Atlantic RegionWomack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, VA; McDonald Army Health Center, FT Eustis, VA; and Naval Hospital, Camp Lejeune, NC. Heartland Region-Wright Patterson Air Force Base Medical Center, Dayton, OH; Blanchfield Army Community Hospital,  FT Campbell, KY; Naval Health Clinic, Great Lakes, IL; and Ireland Regional Army Community Hospital, Ft Knox, KY. <BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Prime Vendor (PV) for the LSA  North (Owens & Minor). This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their items. This RFRIAQ will result in a Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) that supplements the PV Program. This RFRIAQ will not result in a contract award. For additional information regarding DSCP PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR>The Lead TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from the date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of five (5) years. An anticipated selection date is November, 2008. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical <BR><BR>and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the LSA - North, the Government reserves the right to make multiple selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. Point of Contact is Tracy Martin-Tilghman, Team Logistician, Phone: 202-782-3663, and email: tracy.martin-tilghman@amedd.army.mil.  <BR><BR>B. Products & Performance Required. <BR>The LSA  North is seeking product line items in the category of Hand Sanitizers/Lotions, which at a minimum includes the product lines below. Within the LSA-North the total product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $306,938. This forecast is based on historical PV sales during a recent 12-month period and includes the following top high volume usage lines for this project: <BR><BR>PART # 	DESCRIPTION<BR>1181RP		ANTISEPTIC HANDRUB WITH EMOLLIENTS 18 X 15 OUNCE BOTTLES PER CASE<BR>639536		FOAMED ALCOHOL 24 X 9 OZ BOTTLES PER CASE<BR>9651-24		INSTANT HAND SANITIZER 4 OZ BOTTLE<BR>2156-08		INSTANT HAND SANITIZER 1000ML REFILL<BR>110523		1.2 LITER BOTTLES<BR>9659-12		INSTANT HAND SANITIZER 12 OZ BOTTLE<BR>118103		ANTISEPTIC HANDRUB WITH EMOLLIENTS 72 X 4 OUNCE BOTTLES PER CASE<BR>9222		INSTANT HAND ANTISEPTIC (PUMP BOTTLE) 16.9 OZ. 12/CS<BR>639936		FOAMED ALCOHOL 24 X 9 OZ<BR>639557		FOAMED ALCOHOL 24 X 5.4 OUNCE BOTTLES PER CASE<BR><BR>C. Instructions to Vendors. <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria with electronic product literature, and the following information--(1) Company name and address, (2) Company Point of Contact <BR>(Name, Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the Lead TRBO POC: larry.shaughnesy@amedd.army.mil (202-782-3666). All email communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on September 1, 2008. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. <BR><BR>This process will include the vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical/company criteria, electronic product literature (including MSDS information), no-cost samples for clinical evaluation when requested, and submission of electronic best value price quotes when requested. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Lead TRBO POC that their initial submission, and best price submissions when requested actually arrived at the Lead TRBO  via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the deadline, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>      <BR><BR>D. Evaluation Criteria. <BR>The LSA  North Tri-Service Product Review Boards (TPRBs) are the governing boards of the standardization process. These boards include clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the LSA  North. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process. <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this RFRIAQ by emailing their intent to participate, the required company/company POC information, electronic product literature (including MSDS information), and detailed responses to the technical/company criteria listed below to the above Lead TRBO POC (larry.shaughnesy@amedd.army.mil) by the required deadline. Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the respective TPRBs and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine each vendors acceptability. After review of the technical/company criteria responses, those vendors who meet these criteria will be asked for pricing and will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. <BR>1. In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: a. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services. b. The vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>2. Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability. This specific standard for technical acceptability will be sent forth with the individual criterion. <BR>3. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via email notification.  <BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Hand Sanitizers/Lotions. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. <BR>a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes but is not limited to Hand Sanitizers in both liquid/gel and foam formulas with an alcohol content of between 60%-95% [per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings, October 2002], and Compatible Lotions designed to complement the Hand Sanitizers product line and do not interfere/negate the anti-microbial effects of the Hand Sanitizers. <BR>b. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature (including MSDS information) in response to this RFRIAQ. Vendors are required to supply all items listed above. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as listed above will be disqualified in Phase I. <BR>2. Vendors MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Hand <BR><BR>Sanitizers/Lotions product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in progress in response to this RFRIAQ. NOTE: Vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I.     <BR>3. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the current prime vendor (PV) (Owens & Minor) for distribution within the LSA-North.  Vendors whose products are not available through Owens & Minor will be disqualified. Provide documentation of agreement with PV in response to this RFRIAQ.<BR>4. Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. NOTE: Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFRIAQ when requested. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified. .   <BR>5. Vendors must provide a local vendor representative in each region within the LSA-North. Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and email address in response to this RFRIAQ. <BR>6. Vendors must provide inservice/implementation and ongoing support to all Regional MTFs  within the LSA-North as needed.  Vendors must identify company resources for such requirements in response to this RFRIAQ. Provide electronic literature, if available, describing this support. <BR>7. Vendors must have educational tools and materials for the Hand Sanitizers/Lotions product line and provide evidence of this with the initial submittal. Provide literature on the <BR>tools/materials available. <BR>8. Vendors must provide latex-free product accessories/packaging.     <BR>9. Vendors must provide products in individual/personal-sized packaging, and must provide multi-use dispensers that provide a pre-measured amount with each use. All dispensers must be clearly labeled as to contents and must include manufacturing lot number and must include expiration date as appropriate.    <BR>10. Vendors products must not contain substances that compromise the integrity of latex medical gloves (for example, petrolatum, lanolin, mineral oil, or similar substances). <BR>11. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of specific pathogens susceptible to the offered Hand Sanitizer anti-microbial action, and vendor MUST provide supporting documentation for pathogen-specific susceptibility in response to this RFRIAQ. <BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process <BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the respective TRBOs, on behalf of the Clinical Product Team (CPT), will request product sample sets and literature for Hand <BR><BR>Sanitizers/Lotions at no cost to the Government or to the CPT member recipient to be sent to the CPT members at the MTFs within the Regions comprising LSA  North.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the issue of the notice requesting the no-cost product sample sets in which to deliver the no-cost sample sets to the designated recipients.   Requested no-cost product sample sets and literature must arrive at the designated recipients addresses no later than <BR><BR>the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets. Vendors whose no-cost product sample sets do not arrive by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.   <BR><BR>The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days but may be extended due to staff availability and evaluation site work pace. Specific CPT members will evaluate the product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting. The evaluation responses will be recorded using a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range. The scale descriptors are: One (1)-Extremely Poor; Two (2)-Below Average; Three (3)-Average; Four (4)-Above Average; and Five (5)-Excellent. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiativeat of near 3.75depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e. a gap between vendors average scores). In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.75, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold. Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>HAND SANITIZERSLiquid/Gel and Foam Formulas - Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold: 3.75. Each evaluator will dispense product a minimum of ten (10) times over the evaluation period in a clinical (patient care) setting in order to evaluate the product performance using each of the following criteria:  <BR>1.   Hand Sanitizer product dispenses pre-measured amount effortlessly without repeated attempts and/or without clogging and/or dripping from the dispensing nozzle. <BR>   a. Effortless dispensing is a key component in staff compliance and time efficiency during patient care; no-drip dispensing prevents a safety risk from wet floors/counters. <BR>   b. Evaluator will observe dispensers for barriers to ease of dispensing such as repeated attempts, clogging, and/or dripping leading to an insufficient amount for effective cleansing.      <BR>2.   Hand Sanitizer product absorbs easily and quickly.    <BR>   a. Easy and quick absorption is a key component in staff compliance and time efficiency during patient care; quick absorption prevents slippery skin surfaces which place staff/patients at risk for mishaps/injury.      <BR>   b. Evaluator will observe for consistent absorption and drying time less than 30 seconds. <BR>3.   Hand Sanitizer product leaves the skin feeling smooth, soft, and non-irritated (not dry, cracked, chafed or irritated).    <BR>   a. Dry, cracked, chafed, and/or irritated skin is a deterrent to staff compliance; dry, cracked, chafed, and/or irritated skin is vulnerable to infection.      <BR>   b. Evaluator will observe for dry, cracked, chafed, and/or irritated skin.      <BR><BR><BR><BR>4.   Hand Sanitizer product does not leave a greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue/residue build-up on skin after absorption.   <BR>   a. Residue/residue build-up on skin after absorption may attract environmental microbes/pathogens placing staff/patients at risk for infection.     <BR>   b. Evaluator will observe for greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue/residue buildup on skin.     <BR>5.   Hand Sanitizer product scent/odor is not offensive during dispensing and/or after absorption.   <BR>   a. Offensive scent/odor may cause allergic/sensitivity response in staff and/or patients.  <BR>   b. Evaluator will observe for offensive scent/odor and/or lingering offensive scent/odor.   <BR>6.   Hand Sanitizer product does not interfere with donning/removal of medical gloves (exam or surgical gloves).   <BR>   a. Interference with donning/removal of medical gloves is a deterrent to use of Hand Sanitizers and/or the use of medical gloves as personal protective equipment during patient care.     <BR>   b. After dispensing product and allowing to absorb/dry on the skin, evaluator will don and remove medical gloves (exam or surgical gloves) and observe for ease of donning/removal of gloves. <BR><BR>COMPATIBLE LOTIONS  Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold: 3.75. Each evaluator will dispense product a minimum of ten (10) times over the evaluation period in a clinical (patient care) setting in order to evaluate the product performance using each of the following criteria:  <BR>1.   Lotion product dispenses pre-measured amount effortlessly without repeated attempts and/or without clogging and/or without dripping from the dispensing nozzle.  <BR>   a. Effortless dispensing is a key component in time efficiency during patient care.     <BR>   b. Evaluator will observe dispenser for barriers to ease of dispensing such as repeated attempts, clogging, and/or dripping leading to an insufficient amount for effective moisturizing.        <BR>2.   Lotion product absorbs easily and quickly.    <BR>   a. Easy and quick absorption is a key component in time efficiency during patient care; quick absorption prevents slippery skin surfaces which place staff/patients at risk for mishaps/injury.      <BR>   b. Evaluator will observe for consistent absorption time less than 30 seconds.  <BR>3.   Lotion product does not leave a greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue/residue build-up on skin after absorption.  <BR>   a. Residue/residue build-up on skin after absorption may attract environmental microbes/pathogens placing staff/patients at risk for infection.     <BR>   b. Evaluator will observe for greasy/oily and/or sticky/tacky residue/residue buildup on skin. <BR>4.   Lotion product scent/odor is not offensive during dispensing and/or after absorption.   <BR>   a. Offensive scent/odor may cause allergic/sensitivity response in staff and/or patients.  <BR>   b. Evaluator will observe for offensive scent/odor and/or lingering offensive scent/odor.  <BR>5.   Lotion product does not interfere with donning or removal of medical gloves (exam or surgical gloves).   <BR>   a. Interference with donning/removal of medical gloves is a deterrent to the use of medical gloves as personal protective equipment during patient care.     <BR>   b. After dispensing product and allowing to absorb into the skin, evaluator will don and remove medical gloves (exam or surgical gloves) and observe for ease of donning/removal of gloves.<BR>  <BR>Phase III Plan - Pricing Analysis Process:  <BR>1.	The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices<BR><BR>(Post-Standardization Costs) on the LSA-North; (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines (evaluator difficulty in  comparing vendors price quotes to similar product lines); and (3) Consideration of vendors SKUs (vendors supplying the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs, for minimally-differentially products, would more likely provide the best value solution to the Government in this standardization initiative). Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the LSA-North is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  <BR>   Vendors who meet the technical/company criteria are qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation and will be requested to submit best value pricing, a competitive product cross-reference, and value-adds for analysis. Those vendors who do not meet the technical/company criteria are not qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance and will not be requested to submit pricing quotes.  Such vendors will be disqualified from further consideration. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.  <BR>2. Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of request to submit RIA pricing quotes, the competitive product cross reference, and value adds in a prescribed electronic  format, based upon the total requirements of the LSA-North. The LSA-North intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the notice to submit RIA pricing. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the LSA-North). The LSA-North reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The LSA-North reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. Those vendors who fail to respond to the notice to submit RIA pricing quotes as required will be disqualified from further consideration.  <BR>3.  The technical/company and clinical/performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become <BR>more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<BR>4. A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: (1) the requirements of the LSA-North for Hand Sanitizers/Lotions product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and (2) the requirements of the LSA-North for Hand Sanitizers/Lotions product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is seeking Statements of Capabilities from Industry for anticipated requirements to provide Training and Performance System (TPSS) and technical training development and implementation. BACKGROUND:   TPSS is an existing VBA system of web-based training modules and electronic job aids, with accompanying case-based performance practice and performance testing. TPSS addresses technical tasks in VBA, such as "rate an original disability claim for compensation," rather than general training issues such as management and supervision.TPSS exists or is being developed for the five VBA Services:  Compensation and Pension, Education, Insurance. Loan Guaranty, and Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment.  TPSS is developed via needs assessment and the Instructional Systems Development (ISD) methodology.  Sources should have expertise and experience in needs assessment, ISD, criterion-referenced performance testing, industrial and organizational psychology, web-based cooperative learning, training coordinator training, and web-based training and its implementation. ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS:  The VBA will require training support services to obtain development and implementation packages for technical training in the Veterans Benefit Administration.  The VBA is considering multiple contracting actions of various types, including Firm Fixed Price, Time and Materials, or Cost plus Incentives for the following types of services1.	Technical Training: This is training that addresses tasks such as skills, knowledge, attitudes, and metacognitive elements.  In such a case, the contractor would analyze, design, develop, evaluate, and implement the technical training.2.	Instructional approach: The contractor would provide professional expertise in the areas of need assessment, instructional system development, education evaluation adult facilitated learning, cooperative learning criterion-referenced testing, electronic performance support systems (EPSS), etc.Additional requirements include not utilizing any offshore resources for the TPSS contract.  For the purposes of this inquiry, the VBA defines offshore as being any location outside the United States, its possessions, and Puerto Rico.  Also, normal business hours for the VA-FSC are 6:00am  6:00 pm Central Time (CT) Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  However, in some cases, after hours support may be required.POSSIBLE CONTRACT CONSIDERATIONS:  The VBA is considering acquiring the services necessary to satisfy this requirement through competitive means under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) 69, Category 27-400.  Award priority will be given to Service Disabled Veteran Owned small businesses and Veteran Owned small businesses.  These services may be solicited separately.ROAD AHEAD:  VBA is in the preliminary stages of developing an optimal acquisition strategy to satisfy this anticipated requirement.  To help us determine industry interest, capability, and whether the anticipated acquisition can be set-aside for small and Veterans owned business concerns, interested firms are asked to submit a Statement of Capabilities that addresses the following: 1.	Overview of your technical capabilities to provide the TPSS services requested for the VBA. Documentation of technical expertise and capability must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition. It is imperative that business concerns responding to this sources sought articulate their capabilities clearly and adequately;2.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Construction & Facilities Management is looking for historic preservation firms that are SDVOSB, VOSB, and/or WOSB.  Additionally, the VA is looking for firms that are SBA certified in the following programs:  8(a), 8(a) ANC, HUBZone and SDB.  The firm must be a firm approved under NAICS Code 541690 with a small business size standard of $6.5 Million and meet the Secretary of Interior's Historic Preservation Professional Qualification Standards for Architectural History or History, per 36 CFR Part 61. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requires the services of a professional historic preservation firm to assist with several different historic preservation and NHPA Section 106 compliance tasks at various locations throughout the country.  The National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), oversees 125 national cemeteries and 33 soldiers' lots, of which the majority are technically historic and listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). It is NCA's policy to categorize its monuments as "historic," regardless of their age, and it is NCA's policy to accept appropriate, new donated monuments. NCA's monuments are found throughout the United States, but the oldest and most significant are located predominantly east of the Mississippi River. Thematically these are generally associated with the Civil War or multiple U.S. conflicts. In 2006, NCA completed an initial, comprehensive survey of its monuments/memorials in partnership with the Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!) program of Heritage Preservation Inc.; this data is updated annually to assure that new monuments are documented.  The oldest and most significant monuments will be identified by the History Program, NCA. NCA will prioritize and locate the monuments within manageable working "clusters" (such as a 50-mile radius) in cooperation with the contractor, to initiate the project. The contractor shall assure that a range of conservators with expertise in assessment and treatment of outdoor sculpture, located throughout the country, are available for site visits and preparation of assessment documentation.At this time, no solicitation exists, therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A SOLICITATION.     Contractors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements and can answer YES to all of the above; please forward an email (ONLY) to noella.bond@va.gov with the following information:  1. Name and address of your firm. 2. Name, phone number, and email address of a point of contact.  3. DUNS number.  4. Certified business type.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Influenza Division intends to issue a sole source purchase order to University of Iowa College of Public Health, Dept of Epidemiology for a Certificate in Emerging Infectious Disease Epi Program. The University of Iowa's program is unique and is well matched to the needs of CDC's collaborators in developing countries. Their experience and expertise in providing this training can not be found elsewhere. CDC have noted that animal public health authorities in developing, international countries have limited skilled staff, often with poor epidemiologic and policy training. The new emergence of avian influenza represents a global health threat, and addressing it adequately will require a larger cohort of skilled zoonotic public health officers in countries where avian influenza is currently a threat. CDC has a large international program that targets improvements in surveillance, human clinical care, laboratory capacity and planning, but all will rely on high quality animal and human public health infrastructure. The University of Iowa, and their comprehensive zoonotic adeptness in this area, will enable CDC to identify qualified applicants in high risk countries, who, if trained, can add value to their countries' and region's preparedness. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This requirement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions, please email bwest@cdc.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source basis with PicoQuant Photonics North America, Inc.-PQPI, 61 Union Street, Westfield, MA 01085.  NIST is working on the Quantum Information research project.  An entangled photon pair source is almost completed and ready for testing and will then be applied to the next experiment.  To characterize the entangled photon pair source, NIST needs a very specific instrument(PicoHarp 300) to record time tagged events for photon pair coincidence measurement.  For such measurement, NIST request the instrument as follows: It must have two identical synchronized but independent input channels for the pairs of photons with multi-stop capability. The time resolution for single photon counting is as high as 4 ps with 65536 histogram channels. Its count rate is up to 10 million counts/sec, which matches with the count rate of NISTs single photon detectors in the lab. It must have time-Tagged Time-Resolved (TTTR) mode. It must be able to use external synchronization signals for measurement control. It must have multi-channel routing capability. It is connected to the PC via a state of the art USB 2.0 high speed Interface. A driver library (DLL) supports custom programming in e.g C/C++,Visual Basic and LabView.  The PicoHarp 300-Time Correlated Single Photon Counting Module is made by PicoQuant in Germany and sold through its sales representative, Opto Electronic Components (OEC) in the U.S. 
The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) because the Government has not identified any other sources that can meet the requirements specified above. Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that clearly and unambiguously demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to provide Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting Module. Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Comsol, Inc., 1 New England Executive Park, Suite 350, Burlington, MA 018035001, to provide COMSOL Multiphysics, AC/DC Module and MEMS Module software codes. Only COMSOL meets NISTs general purpose needs for solving equations and doing computer simulations for the reliability of nanoelectronics. Other commercial software does not have the functionality and feature set (couple integral differential equations with arbitrary and adaptive gridding), that NIST needs to meet our mission.  The period of performance will be September 1, 2008 through August 31, 2009. The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis. Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. No solicitation document is available; therefore, requests for such a document will be considered invalid responses. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no affirmative responses are received by August 19, 2008, by 3:30 local time, the Contracting Officer will proceed with the award to COMSOL, Inc.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Western Shelter Systems Inc. (WSSI) for the re-supply of National Disaster Medical Systems (NDMS) inventories in support of the Disaster Medical Assistance (DMA) mission.  The proposed award is for $1.4M under NAICS 624230.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, WSSI, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by the FAR Part 6.302-1.  WSSI is the only known available source with unique capabilities to satisfy NMMS requirements because the Rapid Deploy Shelter System product it manufactures has become the standardized sheltering system used across NDMS programs.  Due to the nature of the Rapid Deploy Shelter System and the specificity of component parts within that system, it is considered critical that any supplier possess the requisite knowledge and capability to readily supply system-specific accessories for seamless integration into the system and replenishment of existing inventories. 

The purpose of this notice is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to supply the Rapid Deploy Shelter System package accessories.  Any source capable of supplying the accessories should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as articulated above. 

This notice is issued for information purposes and is not a request for competitive proposals. Any interested party should submit a statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirements of this notice can be met no later than 15 days from the date of the announcement.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed action based on responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Reponses to this notice must be sent via e-mail to William.Li@psc.hhs.gov.

<DESC>Liquid Chromatography System for Protein Purification<BR> <BR> <BR><BR>We require the ability to purify biomolecules from complex starting materials. The system we will use must be able to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity.<BR><BR> We require a flow rate range of .01-100 mls/min at pressures ranging from 0-10 MPa (1450 psi). <BR><BR>Because the resolution we require may necessitate the use of very precise, shallow gradients, the system must be a two-pump gradient system, with dynamic mixing, as evidence suggests that this configuration produces the highest accuracy and precision in gradient formation. <BR><BR> Because we will be using salt buffers, the entire wetted flow path of the system must be inert to halides. The pump heads must be titanium with valves and tubing in PEEK. <BR><BR>The system pumps should allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure system compatibility with standard low-pressure chromatography supports often used in affinity chromatography and other techniques.<BR><BR>The controller must allow programs to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based.<BR><BR>The system should include the option of a fraction collector that is fully integrated into the system and fully controllable via the system control software. This fraction collector must have the capacity to fractionate into 175 x 12-mm diameter tubes or 95 x 10-18mm tubes.<BR><BR>The system must include a motorized valve for sample injection. In order to facilitate cleaning, storage, selection of our various chromatographic columns, and further automation the system must have the ability to control 8 more motorized valves for a total 9 motorized valves. This is necessary for buffer selection, injection, flow diversion, diverting peaks to sample loops etc.  Also, these motorized valves should provide feedback to the control system to ensure proper orientation of all valves, and documentation of valve positions at all times.  The valves should be driven electronically and require no external air or pressure to operate.<BR><BR>The system controller must allow the user to be entering details of the next purification at the same time the current separation is being done, or to simultaneously be integrating and evaluating the results of earlier runs. The software must allow complete manual control of all parameters and running conditions while running a method.<BR><BR>Control of motorized valves, fraction collector, dynamic gradient mixer, and autosampler must all be possible from the system controller.<BR><BR>The pumps, UV, pH and conductivity monitors, valves and fraction collector must all be specified for use in a cold room at 4 degrees C.<BR><BR>The controller must accept seven input signals (e.g. UV wavelength, conductivity, pH, temperature, pressure).  It must be capable of plotting, and integrating these signals, as well as using them to trigger sub-routines in the programming when the signal exceeds a preset threshold, to allow the automation of multi-dimensional separations.<BR><BR>The system must include one automatic three-position injection valve (load, inject, and wash positions), which will allow for sample loading onto the column. <BR><BR>The system controller should allow for automation of the optimization of separation parameters (e.g. sample volume, flow rate, gradient slope).  This should allow a small amount of sample to be consumed in optimizing the purification scheme, after which the best regime can be scaled up on the same LC system. <BR><BR>Column equilibration before and after sample injection and elution must be capable of being monitored, with a feed-back loop to the control system, so we can be certain equilibration is completed, without consuming excess volume of sometimes expensive buffers.<BR><BR>Documentation of each run should be automatic and exhaustive, so that for purposes of subsequent replication and eventual publication, no detail is left unrecorded. Access to the controller must be by user name with password and level of access by each user must be definable by administrator. The software must be able to operate on the Windows XP operating system.<BR><BR>Post-run chromatographic analysis and reporting functions should also be included.<BR><BR>In order to protect our columns, the system must have a definable pressure limit system defined when the column is selected from a list which will stop the pump and generate an audible and visual warning, in the event pressure exceeds the preset limit.  We also require that the controller allow the user the option of including in his/her chromatographic methods programs, commands which will automatically reduce the flow rate if an over-pressurization occurs as sample is being applied or eluted from the column. Additional variables which should also be programmable to trigger sub-routines (e.g. new tube on fraction collector; valve changes; etc.) should include UV or conductivity signals.<BR><BR>The controller should permit automatic running of up to 99 different chromatographic programs in a user-designated sequence. It must turn off the pump flow when a signal is received from the fraction collector indicating there are no tubes remaining, so that valuable sample is preserved. The system must automatically and continuously be able to record throughout each chromatographic run the following parameters: flow rate; UV signal; actual AND programmed conductivity of the eluent; eluent pH; system pressure; accumulated time of run; all valve positions and changes in position; activity of a fraction collector - and it must allow these recorded data to be called up later for interpretation and to aid in future replication of results. It must allow for post-run analysis of chromatograms, export of data to other spreadsheet programs, and generation of written reports. Set-up and training must be provided by the vendor, at no additional cost.   <BR>

<a href="mailto:Richard.Furlong@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Acquisition & Logistics, Center for Acquisition Innovation (Austin, TX) intends to modify Contract V797(049A3G)P-096 awarded to Plexis Healthcare Systems, Inc., located at 385 Williamson Way, Ashland, OR  97520 to acquire an additional 12-month license, maintenance and professional services associated with Plexis healthcare claims processing software.  Specifically, the proposed modification, to be acquired on a non-competitive basis, will satisfy the need of the VA Financial Service Center (VA-FSC), located at 1615 Woodward Street, Austin, TX for licenses, maintenance, and manufacturer updates for the Plexis Claims Manager software currently in use for the period of November 1, 2008 to October 31, 2009.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the requirement is 541511.  VAs existing contract with Plexis is firm fixed price.  Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Plexis Healthcare Systems, Inc. is the only known source that can satisfy the requirement described herein.  Included with this announcement in accordance with FAR 11.5 is the Justification and Approval document supporting the non-competitive contract action.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposal.  Interested parties that believe they can meet the requirements described herein must furnish information about their capabilities to the Contracting Officer, along with supporting evidence to the Contract Specialist no later than 12:00PM (Central Time), August 29, 2008.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Telephone or faxed inquired will not be accepted.Point of Contact: Richard J. Furlong, Contract SpecialistE-mail: Richard.Furlong@va.govContracting Office Address:Department of Veterans Affairs; Center for Acquisition Innovation, 1701 Directors Blvd, Suite #810, Austin, TX 78744-1019Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6 Limited Source Justification for Software Maintenance and Professional Services Associated with Health Care Claims Processing  Name Brand Justification(i)	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:This procurement is in support of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Financial Service Center (VA-FSC), located at 1615 Woodward Street, Austin TX 78772.  The Contracting Activity processing the requirement is the Office of Acquisition & Logistics, Center for Acquisition Innovation (Austin), located at 1701 Directors Blvd. Suite 810, Austin TX 78744.(ii)	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved:This is a Name Brand Justification for VA to pursue an award for information technology (IT) software maintenance in support of the VA-FSC.  Specifically, the purpose of this acquisition is to extend Contract V797(049A3G)P-096 for twelve months to provide software maintenance to facilitate medical claims adjudications and payments.   Award of a Firm, Fixed-Price (FFP) contract is anticipated to one vendor.  This software is required to successfully support critical FSC IT operations and initiatives, specifically health care claims processing for other VA offices and Other Government Agencies (OGAs).  The sole-source vendor authorized to sell the required Plexis software is Plexis Healthcare Systems, Inc., located at 385 Williamson Way, Ashland, OR  97520.(iii)	Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agencys Needs (Including the Estimated Value):Over the past year, VA-FSC has increased its OGA customer base for medical claims processing services.  Currently, the primary customer for the FSCs Health Care Claims Processing team is Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS). DIHS has an agreement with VA-FSC to accurately process and submit medical claims for detained illegal immigrants.  As Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and Customs and Border Protection inspectors have increased apprehension of illegal immigrants, the number of medical claims has increased to an unanticipated volume.  In the upcoming fiscal year, the FSC will be providing support to Veterans Health Administration for Project Hero and Millennium Bill projects.  On-going software maintenance is necessary to provide any manufacturer updates and problem resolution for the licenses.  The Plexis Claims Manager software utilized by the VA-FSC is issued by the vendor on a term basis.  Without annual maintenance and support by the vendor, VA-FSC is not authorized to continue usage of the software.The requested extension of the current contract for the period November 2008  October 2009 is $34,716.(iv)	Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.(v)	Demonstration that the Proposed Contractors Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:The VA-FSC currently utilizes Plexis Claims Manager software to support existing healthcare claims processing customers.  Plexis Healthcare Systems, Inc. is the only provider authorized to sell and maintain these licenses.The VA-FSC will pursue acquiring a new medical claims processing and adjudication software in FY09, as Plexis Claims Manager software cannot process the significant increases in medical claims anticipated with the continued roll-out of VHA Project Hero and Mill Bill.  At this time however, it would not be cost-effective at this time to fully migrate to a new product.  The VA-FSC has invested approximately $378,000 to date on Plexis software and services.In order to maintain the required medical services required by DIHS and VHA, the government must ensure health care providers are paid in a timely manner.  The software and services associated with Plexis are a critical element of the overall healthcare process.  Specifically, a break in DIHS ability to provide healthcare to detainees for any reason, including administrative, could have disastrous consequences to the individuals in custody and could lead to a public relations catastrophe for the Government.  (vi)	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice was or will be Publicized as Required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which Exception Under 5.202 Applies:This Named Brand Justification & Approval Document will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities system in accordance with FAR 11.105 (a)(3).(vii)	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  A fair and reasonable price to the Government will be established by the comparison of prices to the current contract, which was established in response to solicitation 797-04-07.  Software and maintenance pricing has increased less than 5% annually, since the original software purchase in 2003.  Professional services rates have remained stagnant over the 5 year period of performance.(viii)	A Description of the Market Research Conducted (See Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research was not Conducted:To maintain consistency with existing applications and users, the most cost-effective method of medical claims adjudication and processing is to continue to use Plexis Claims Manager software.  The FSC provides full lifecycle services from the time a claim reaches the FSC throughout the generation of the payment to the provider of medical services.  Due to scalability issues identified with Plexis Claims Manager software, the FSC is pursuing a separate procurement to potentially replace Plexis during FY09.  However, as we transition to a new product, we have a continuing need to support our current customers.  No vendor other than the manufacturer, Plexis Healthcare Systems is authorized to sell this software. (ix)	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:The cost associated with implementing new software would exceed $4 million.  This expenditure is not in the best interest of the VA-FSC or its customers at this time.  Over the past five fiscal years, the VA-FSC has purchased approximately $328,000 in Plexis licenses, maintenance and support services.   Transition to a new claims management software package is anticipated in FY09.  Continued use of the current solution, Plexis Claims Manager, is required during the acquisition and transition to a more robust solution. (x)	Listing of the Sources, if any, that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:None.(xi)	Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition Before any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required:In accordance with FAR 11.105(a)(3), this Justification & Approval document will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities system.  The FSC will solicit competitive proposals for a replacement medical claims management software package through the NASA Solutions for Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV contract vehicle for Information Technology products and services.  SEWP is the preferred procurement vehicle for VA IT purchases.  During the procurement and transition to a replacement software package, the FSC requires a one-year extension of software maintenance through Plexis.  Without the additional services and maintenance extension, the FSC would be at risk of software failure and inability to continue to process the medical claims submitted for payment.  In that the software is on a term-license basis, the FSC would not be authorized to continue using Plexis Claims Manager without the maintenance extension.(xii)	Contracting Officer Certification that the Justification is Accurate and Complete to the Best of the Contracting Officers Knowledge and Belief:I certify this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.(xiii)	Evidence that any Supporting Data that is the Responsibility of Technical or Requirements Personnel (e.g., Verifying the Government's Minimum Needs or Requirements or Other Rationale for Limited Sources) and which Form a Basis for the Justification have been Certified as Complete and Accurate by the Technical or Requirements Personnel:The representative from the Requiring Office has certified that the supporting information under his/her cognizance, which is included in this Limited Source Justification, is accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief.

The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:</p>

<DESC>NOTE:      THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  
Idaho National Laboratory (INL), operated by the Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA) under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license, develop, and commercialize new technology to ensure secure, encrypted wireless communications and financial transactions. The system, commonly called the Wireless Sentinel, also secures designated use areas  detecting unauthorized cell phones and permitting only authorized wireless devices to operate in the zone.  License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  INL may also be available to partner(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.

***Background:  The proliferation of cell phone technology is adding to the growing challenge of industrial and government espionage.  Cell phones can be triggered remotely to become eavesdropping devices. In response, governments and corporations often ban wireless devices from sensitive areas. While this addresses security, it limits productivity and hinders access to business critical communications.  Also, as smart phones become electronic wallets, information theft and malicious tampering become serious threats.  Securing daily communications, including financial transactions, is a must.

***Description: 
The security application of the Wireless Sentinel system can be configured differently for corporations, military or mobile commerce users. For systems installed for national or corporate security purposes, an organization can use the Wireless Sentinel to detect a compromised or unauthorized cell phone and alert physical security officers or surveillance systems.  By using the Wireless Sentinel to discover and authenticate wireless devices approved for entry into sensitive areas, an organization can allow approved device use while simultaneously discovering and disallowing non-approved devices.  The Wireless Sentinel also detects cell phone break-ins and reports suspicious changes in the phones operating system to its network. Identification and authentication software is installed on each device.  When the system interrogates a wireless device within its monitored area, the device must respond with the proper credentials.

***Development Status:  INL researchers have a working proof-of-concept of the Wireless Sentinel.  This technology requires additional development.

***Intellectual Property:  INL has filed a portfolio of U.S. patent applications and may file for foreign patent rights covering this technology. 

***Commercial Opportunity: INL is seeking industry partners to help further develop and commercialize this technology. The ideal partner would have some or all of the following qualifications:
1.  Experience in a related business
2.  Demonstrated ability to bring inventions to the market
3.  Resources to make an investment in the further development and commercialization of this technology for commercialization
4.  An interest in performing and funding cooperative research at the INL
5.  Substantial manufacturing and research operations in the United States.

NOTE:      THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.      

Companies interested in commercializing the Wireless Sentinel should provide a written statement of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than August 25th, 2008.  The statement of interest should include the following information:
        1.  Company Name and address
        2.  The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact
        3.  A description of companys qualifications relevant to commercializing this technology
        4.  A description of the companys motivation for pursuing this opportunity. 

Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.   Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license may be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.    

Written responses should be directed to:

Note:  DigiGait is a Patented Technology/Methodology - United States Patent
#6,899,686.  
 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Investigators, studying how aging and neurodegenerative processes affect neuromuscular function in animal models, require an automated gait analysis system with a robust and secure data collection and analysis program, which is capable of detecting very subtle to obvious changes in gait under different orientations and levels of locomotion, and which has been validated against paw inking methodology.

The Mouse Specifics DigiGait Imaging System is the only known commercially available system, which can, within a single instrument detect very subtle gait changes, include overground and treadmill locomotion, incline and decline walking, is validated against paw inking methodology, and has an outstanding record of post purchase technical support, including free software updates and secure data control.  The DigiGait System has been successfully used by the AT Children's Project to measure ataxia-telangiectasia (a very subtle and difficult to detect abnormality), is patented technology, is referenced extensively in the literature, and has been used by The Jackson Labs to measure background strains commonly used by NHLBI investigators, thus reducing the need to re-characterize these strains using different equipment.  The system can be used to study gait in mice (including neonates as young as 14 days), rats, guinea pigs, and hamsters; provides a wider range of species capabilities; and is capable of measuring 40 standard metrics of posture.  Furthermore, DigiGait is a U.S. patented technology under U.S. Patent (#6,899,686), Method and Apparatus for Monitoring Locomotion Kinematics for Ambulating Animals.  No other vendor is known to manufacture a single gait analysis system which has the full range of capabilities of the DigiGait Imaging System.  The procurement of this system is essential to the studies being performed in support of the NHLBI Mouse Phenotyping Core.

The Piezo-electric positioning system is needed to provide fine positional control of optical components of coherence-gated wavefront sensor (within a fraction of a laser wavelength) and microscope objective Z-position (with better than 100nm precision over up to 100 micron range).  The coarse control of piezo-mirror should be provided by a DC motor stage with an encoder and travel range of at least 25 mm.  All components must be able to be remotely controlled through a computer interface.

PI (Physik Instrumente) L.P. is the only known company that provides capacitive
feedback sensors for their piezo-position control systems.  This is critical to achieve
necessary precision and speed for close-loop operation during wavefront sensing in
adaptive optics system.  In addition, PI provides General Command Set so that a variety
of motion subsystems (Z-translation, tip-tilt, DC motor motions) can be uniformly and
transparently controlled by a computer within the same programming framework (e.g. NI
Lab VIEW).  Other manufacturers use different types of drivers for different types of motion
controllers.

In addition to exclusive capabilities, procurement of this equipment from PI is essential due to the experience that the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, in the Biochemistry and Biophysics Center, of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has with their PIFOC objective Z-positioners (both in the Labs FCS and the 2p tissue imager).  An award to any other vendor would result in considerable labor being expended to learn and integrate devices of any other type.

A)	Background

The Regional USAID Mission for Central Asian Republics (USAID/CAR), with headquarters located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, is a mission with regional responsibility for the development and management of the U.S. Governments assistance program for the five Central Asian Republics. U.S. assistance is geared to assisting and strengthening reforms in the economic, health, education and political sectors in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

B) Basic Function: 

Under the supervision of the USAID/Central Asian Republics (CAR) Health and Education Director, serves as a professional Education Development Specialist and regional education team leader, performing responsibilities associated with delivering U.S. development assistance programs in the area of basic and higher education in Central Asia.  Work is concentrated primarily in the area of assignment, but the incumbent is expected to participate in cross-cutting teams to support projects related to education system development within other program areas.  The incumbent works in all areas of the sector, at the level described below, and specifically performs the following major duties and responsibilities. 

C) Major Duties and Responsibilities:

A.  Program/Project Development and Management Work			60%

Responsible for the conceptualization, design, documentation, and management of USAID  CAR programs devoted to the development of basic and higher education in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, including identifying and implementing necessary actions related to implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.  Exercises independent judgment and applies broad technical knowledge of formal and non-formal education and trends in preparing or assuring preparation of design and implementation documents, concept papers, briefing and decision memoranda, authorizations, and Congressional notifications.  As the regional education team leader for USAID/CAR, assists the Mission in advancing the state-of-the-art of the formal and non-formal education development discipline, and in improving approaches in activity management.  

Develops and applies new program methods, approaches, and/or technology or extends, revises and adapts existing methodology to new and unusual situations. The social, cultural, economic, governmental, political, and other characteristics of the education programs/projects affect the success of the programs to such a degree that significant program activities must be specifically designed and modified to accommodate them. 

Designs and participates in education sector assessments, and provides technical leadership for regional and country-specific education strategic planning and portfolio reviews.  Presents and defends positions, as required, before annual portfolio and closeout reviews.  Provides guidance to technical offices, USAID mission management, USG country teams, and other groups, as required. Coordinates information and builds consensus among various organizations involved in the preparation and approval of various documents.  Advises Mission Officers on the implications of assessment conclusions, concepts, and on approved strategies for the design and implementation of ongoing and future activities.  Participates in USAID/Washington reviews of Mission program and project proposals which involve significant institutional policy issues, indicates strengths and weaknesses of proposals, and seeks to improve institutional arrangements and structures in order to promote growth and development.  Provides analyses of the effectiveness of major policy reform and non-project assistance interventions and those of other development assistance agencies. 

Manages a variety of highly complex and typically multi-year contracts and grants/agreements, entailing the coordination of efforts and the resolution of conflicting and controversial high profile issues with a number of parties both within and outside the host governments and implementing partners.  Exercises definitive technical authority regarding audit issues and disputes.  Coordinates educational program efforts for the most difficult programs or projects that have unusually demanding social, economic, cultural, governmental, and political conditions requiring the planning, development, and evaluation of matters of general precedent, extensive controversy, or wide coordination. Develops a data base system to collect information related to program/project activities.  Provides technical oversight of cognizant technical officers (CTOs) and activity managers responsible for monitoring and managing education activities at the country level.

B.  Geographic Area/Region-Wide Technical Resource			40%

Serves as USAID/CARs senior regional advisor on education , advising on and backstopping development assistance activities in the area of basic (primary and secondary) and higher education systems development.  Provides leadership, direction and vision for regional education activities.  Reviews and analyzes data; develops strategies, analytical models, and methodologies; and provides assistance and advice on education sector issues in Central Asia.
 
Serves as a technical resource to the USAID Mission and USG country teams in CAR in the identification of critical education issues within the region.  Develops plans and programs for technical assistance, capital assistance, and other activities in the area of assignment; participates in determining regional and country development objectives, based on cooperating country requests, perceived needs, U.S. policy, and determined priorities. 

Represents Mission interests on matters related to the sector at regional and country-specific conferences, technical seminars, and high-level policy meetings.  Works with cooperating countries in CAR regarding specific interests in education development programs, including the development of national strategies appropriate to their individual circumstances.  Ensures USAID education assistance is coordinated with other USG investments in education, and leads USAID/CAR coordination and collaboration with bilateral and multilateral donors involved in education activities. 

Acts as liaison with policy-level government officials for USAID/CAR to ensure that the Agency's and broader USG- views and interests are promoted with respect to current and emerging education policy issues, and that those views are taken into consideration in bilateral policy development and implementation.  

Recommends human and financial resources needed to meet program objectives and fulfill management responsibilities related to education activities. Provides feedback on the performance of activity managers and specialists working on USAID education activities at the country level.  Performs other duties as assigned.

D) POSITION ELEMENTS:

a.  Knowledge Required by the Position 
Mastery of education training program principles, development concepts, international best practices, pedagogical methods, and techniques to apply proven developments and theories to resolve major education challenges confronting CAR.  Expert knowledge of USG, international, and host-government laws and regulations, documentation and reporting requirements, and legal/regulatory processes.  

b.  Supervisory Controls 
The supervisor sets the overall assignment objectives, program emphasis, and resources available. The Education Development Specialist and supervisor, in consultation, develop overall priorities and individual work objectives. The Education Development Specialist has the responsibility for independently planning and carrying out education development programs or projects; determining the approach to be taken and the methods to be used; resolving most of the conflicts that arise; coordinating the work with others as necessary; and interpreting policy in terms of established objectives. The Specialist keeps the supervisor informed of progress, potentially controversial or high-profile matters, and problems with far-reaching implications. Completed work is reviewed for conformance to overall requirements, compatibility with other work, and effectiveness in meeting work and program objectives. 
 
c.  Guidelines 
Administrative policies and precedents, ADS Chapters, mission orders, USAID special  directives, foreign assistance program definitions, and technical references are generally applicable.  The Education Development Specialist uses judgment, initiative and resourcefulness in interpreting guidelines and in developing and recommending new or substantially modified methods, guidance, or policies. 
 
d.  Complexity 
The work includes a wide variety of duties requiring many different and unrelated processes and methods applied to a broad range of activities in the five Central Asian republics.  The geographic area of responsibility is quite broad, with significant differences in education priorities and environment.  Decision-making relies on a continual assessment of very complex and diverse circumstances that involve major areas of uncertainty in approach, methodology, or interpretation resulting from such elements as continuing program changes, technological developments, new or unconventional methods, unique or controversial aspects of USAID activities, or conflicting interests or ideas (as between Mission or host-country requirements and recognized educational training practices). This work sometimes requires devising new methods and techniques to produce effective results or to implement advances in the state of the art; establishing criteria for administering or evaluating educational training programs; or developing policy guidance and procedural material for use by Mission, host-country, and/or NGO/PVO personnel. 
 
e.  Scope and Effect 
The purpose of the work is to plan and carry out a variety of important education development activities. The work involves establishing criteria (e.g., developing guidance or procedures for major activities); formulating projects; assessing program effectiveness; investigating or analyzing a variety of unusual conditions or questions; and providing advice and technical expertise to USAID/Washington, Mission personnel, host-country representatives, and others on specific functions or programs. Assignments typically involve education assistance problems that are particularly difficult, or that are systemic in nature. The work directly influences the effectiveness and acceptability of USAID development assistance and, frequently, the operation of other USG agencies or host-government institutions. 
 
f.  Personal Contacts 
The persons contacted by the Specialist include subject matter specialists, training officials, contractors, attorneys, host-country officials, representatives of other USG agencies, professional organizations, organized or ad hoc groups. This level may also include contacts with high-level Agency and local and national government officials - several managerial levels removed from the employee. 
 
g.  Purpose of Contacts 
At times the purpose of contacts is to influence, motivate, or persuade persons or groups who are typically skeptical, resistant, or uncooperative, and who must be approached skillfully to obtain the desired effect (e.g., negotiating policy milestones or timetables with government officials; influencing or persuading NGOs/PVOs to agree to use new or improved technologies about which there may be conflicting opinions; representing USAID as a member of an institutional committee on controversial topics; justifying the feasibility and desirability of plans or proposals that significantly affect NGO/PVO or host-government practices, such as financing reform, corrective action plans, or co-funding requirements for programs/projects. 
 
h.  Physical Demands 
The work is primarily sedentary, although some physical effort may be required, e.g., walking, standing, carrying light items such as manuals or briefcases, or driving or traveling by motor vehicle in rural areas with poor infrastructure. Required overnight travel may be as high as 40% of the time.
 
i.  Work Environment 
The work environment involves everyday risks or discomforts that require normal safety precautions typical of such places as offices, training rooms, and libraries. The work area is adequately lighted, heated, and ventilated. There may be occasional exposure to moderate risks or discomfort during program/project and country visits. 

E) MINIMUM QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS:

b.

Preference will be given to those whose international experience includes strategic planning and analysis. Preference will also be given to individuals with knowledge of USAID procedures and systems for strategic planning, activity design, program monitoring and evaluation.  

c.  Leadership skills - Exceptional leadership and interpersonal skills are absolutely critical.  Preference will be given to applicants that can demonstrate experience in effectively interacting with a broad range of internal and external partners and clients, such as project beneficiaries, international organizations, government officials, universities or institutes, contractors/grantees, and NGOs. 

d.  Language and communication skills - Must be fluent in English (level IV or V) and have proven ability to communicate quickly, clearly, and concisely, both orally and in writing.  Must have demonstrated ability to produce high-quality analytical pieces and make persuasive, logical oral presentations to high-level audiences.  Proficiency in Russian (at least level III) is required, and knowledge of Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Turkmen or Tajik languages is desired.

<DESC>SAMHSA/OPPB/DPC through the Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Sourcing, Division of Acquisition Management intends to award a sole source, Simplified Acquisition, FAR Part 13.105, to the University of Wisconsin System, Center for Health Environment System Studies. The Center for Health Enhancement Systems Studies is unique in  that the development of the Network for the Improvement of Additional Treatment (NIATx)  was initiated by the Center for Health Enhancement Systems Studies, University of Wisconsin. To that end, the institutional knowledge base of the aforementioned uniquely qualifies the sole source, only source known that can satisfy the needs of the government, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.

Background:

The Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) is a national initiative supported program and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrations Center for Substance Abuse Treatments Strengthening Treatment Access and Retention (STAR) program, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundations Paths to Recovery program, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Since its inception in 2003, NIATx member organizations and states have generated a strong body of knowledge about how to improve the quality of addiction treatment across the United States.

SAMHSA/CSAT has been a primary sponsor for the successful process improvement initiatives that NIATx has directed, including the Strengthening Treatment Access and Retention (STAR) project, the State Pilot to Improve Addiction Treatment, and currently, the Strengthening Treatment Access and Retention-State Initiative (STAR-SI.) 

A set of key partners have been identified and enrolled in supporting and steering the Campaign including, NIATx, National Association of State Alcohol/Drug Treatment Directors, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Legal Action Center, State Association of Addiction Services, Faces and Voices of Recovery, American Association of Opiod Dependence, and others. This represents an unprecedented alliance among national organizations that share a commitment to improving access and engagement to treatment. 

A structure for deploying the campaign has been developed, which includes 
an ACTION Campaign Steering Committee, a working committee made up of key stakeholders, along with four subcommittees, focusing on: resource development; marketing and communications; measurement and outcomes; and participant support 

The Campaign was announced at the NIATx Summit in April 2007, at which time all the key partners where introduced and the pre-launch phase was initiated. The pre-launch phase will run from MaySeptember 2007. The Campaigns official launch will be part of National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month 2007 activities.

Currently work is underway to establish the national infrastructure necessary to support the September 2007 Campaign launch, including local learning networks, Web- based communications and learning support for participants, resource development efforts, marketing and communications strategies, and data collection and analysis initiatives.

Purpose:

The Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) in collaboration with its partner organizations is requesting resources to help support the continued design and deployment of the ACTION Campaign (Adopting Changes to Improve Outcomes Now).

The ACTION Campaign initially set a goal of impacting the lives and increasing the probability of long-term recovery for 75,000 people. Due to the tremendous response from providers in the initial months of the Campaign, ACTION increase its enrollment target from 500 to 800 providers and extended the length of the campaign from 18 to 24 months.  Each participant ACTION campaign provider is expected to adopt one of three simple, practical, and actionable ACTIONS, which, based on NIATx process improvement experience can have a major impact on the effective delivery of treatment services.

The following three ACTIONS are the core themes of the campaign:

1.	Providing rapid access to services
2.	Improving client engagement
3.	Creating a seamless transition between levels of care ( handoffs)

Each ACTION will focus on one to three specific promising practices that have made a difference, and each promising practice will include a set of essential ingredients and steps for implementation.

NIATx, on behalf of the ACTION Campaign partners, is requesting SAMHSA fund Phase 2 of the campaign in the amount of $50,000. These funds supplement the funds and in-kind support generated to date, including $150,000 committed by NIATx in supporting the campaign as a means of disseminating promising practices, based on NIATx process improvement work nationally.

The overall proposed budget for the successful completion of the campaign is 
$1.5 million. The Resource Development Committee has developed a fundraising strategy for the 24-month period of the Campaign.  CSAT/SAMHSA support in 2008 would be utilized to support Phase 2 implementation planning, communications, and evaluation of campaign activities.  Specific deliverables and a budget are listed below.

Scope of Work:

NIATx and the ACTION Campaign partners will embark on a series of tasks to build awareness for the Campaign activities and its goal to improve 55,000 lives. Support from SAMHSA will enable the ACTION Campaign to complete the following:

The following factors shall be used to evaluate Offers:  Technical Capability, Price and Past Performance.   Technical will be evaluated as either Acceptable or Unacceptable. Definitions are as follows:  ACCEPTABLE:  To be rated acceptable, the offerors technical proposal must demonstrate it can meet all requirements in the Statement of Work. UNACCEPTABLE:  A technical proposal that fails to demonstrate it can meet one or more requirements of the Statement of work will be determined unacceptable.  Past Performance will be evaluated as high risk, medium risk and low risk with definitions as follows:  Unsatisfactory / High Risk - Significant doubt exists that the offeror will satisfactorily perform the services on solicitation, based on preponderance of unsatisfactory performance records under the various factor evaluations, or offerors record of unsuccessful past and current contracts performance in fulfilling requirements similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offerors have consistently not met work schedules and other obligations, have defaulted on at least one contract within the past three years, or have chronically failed to meet contract terms. -Satisfactory / Moderate Risk - Some doubt exists based on instances of record of poor performance, especially in contracts similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offeror meets work schedules and specified services most of the time, meets contract terms without failure or resolves issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years. Good / Low Risk - Little doubt exists, based on the offeror's preponderance of good, if not excellent past and current records of contract performance, especially in large contracts similar to the size and complexity of the services under solicitation.  Verification of past performance shows that offeror consistently meets work schedules, provides specified services, meets contract terms without failure, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years. <BR>Offeror without technical or insufficient technical information to show that their offer meets the performance work statement shall not be evaluated for award. Neutral Risk   No relevant past performance Information.   PRICE:  Price will be evaluated separately from past performance and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability.  Offeror shall provide their published price list with their offer.  <BR> The Government reserves the right to award to other than the low offeror for better technical capability and/or better performance records.

(End of provision) 
The provision 52.212-2 EvaluationCommercial Items applies to this acquisition as follows:
 
EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
a. TECHNICAL APPROACH: 
Sub-factor 1: The Government will evaluate the technical capability of the item offered to determine the vendors ability to provide the product meeting the USCG Academys specifications. Vendors shall provide sufficient and detailed related information to clearly demonstrate the vendors capability to provide products meeting these specifications. 
b. RELEVANT PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Relevant past performance includes three (03) years experience in manufacturing and maintenance support of the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrometer.

Vendors shall complete the designated section of the Contract Data Sheets (Enclosure 1) for up to three of their most recently completed Federal Government contracts (not to exceed three years since completion) in which the vendor  built and supplied Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. The Contractor shall forward the Contract Data Sheet to the contract specialist listed on the document with the offeror. The Contractor is NOT to fill out the questionnaire section of the Data Sheet. The questions provided are typical of but no limited to type of questions will be asked of the past performance source. If the vendor does not have any Federal Government contracts, then list state, local, or commercial contracts, in that order. Responses shall be brief and concise. Data submitted other than that requested on the Contract Data Sheets will not be considered.  Failure to submit Contract Data Sheets shall be considered certification that the Contractor has no past performance for the Government to evaluate. A vendors lack of relevant past performance will be rated as neutral. The Government reserves the right to contact references other than those listed in the vendor's proposal.

c. PRICE: The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness. Vendors shall provide their total proposed price to meet the requirements outline in the specifications. 

Basis of Award: This order shall be awarded to the vendor determined to represent the best value to the United States Coast Guard. Overall technical approach is considered to be more important than past performance; however, technical approach and past performance combined are more important than price. As the technical evaluation scores converge, price may become more important. 

 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The incorporated document and provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.  Solicitation Number 21093396SRE92 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  This action is set-aside for small business.  The associated North American Industry Classification System Code is 541330 with the small business standard is $4.5.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The solicitation number is FA8773-08-R-0054, and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). This amended solicitation/synopsis replaces FA8773-08-R-0054 in its entirety.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize full and open competition; there are no set asides for small businesses. For this acquisition, a concern will be considered small under NAICS 517110 with size standard of 1500 employees.</p>
<p>Simplified procurement procedures will be used for this acquisition per FAR Parts 12 and 13. This acquisition is determined to be subject to FAR Part 13, Test Program for Certain Commercial Services of the FAR regarding the acquisition of commercial services and also subject to FAR Par 15 regarding contracting by negotiation.</p>
<p>In accordance with Air Force (AF) Instruction 33-111, the 38th EIG is the only authorized contracting office to order local exchange telephone services for the AF including Air National Guard, AF Reserve and AF recruiting offices. 38 EIG/PKK has a requirement for awarding Firm-Fixed Price Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for an effective period up to ten years in order to, on an as needed basis, acquire local telephone exchange services for smaller AF sites and AF recruiting offices throughout the United States (CONUS). All BPA calls are referenced herein as "Communication Service Authorizations" (CSAs) and subject to the terms and conditions of the BPA. Each CSA will generally have a five-year period of performance but can be issued from one to 10 years. Local telecommunications services shall include, as a minimum but not limited to, local access for commercial business lines, DSL or internet services, voice mail, directory number and number portability, operator and directory assistance, local and Intra-LATA access, and interconnection with Inter-LATA exchange carrier.</p>
<p>38 EIG/PKK intends to negotiate multiple BPAs with qualified sources in order to competitively award CSAs for local exchange services. Responding to this synopsis in no manner guarantees a BPA will be negotiated with the respondent. The establishment of a BPA with a respondent in no way obligates the government to issue any CSAs against the BPA. 38 EIG/PKK does not guarantee any minimum level of work under any resultant BPA. Individual CSAs will not exceed $1 million. There will be no limit to the number of CSAs issued under any of the prospective BPAs. The government may issue orders requiring services at multiple locations. Only 38 EIG/PKK will be able to issue CSAs against the established BPAs. There is no specific commitment by either party, until dates, services, and schedule are mutually negotiated by individual CSAs against resulting BPAs. Offers may be submitted through February, 2018. A respondent may at any time submit a proposal electronically via email requesting establishment of a BPA from the POC's e-mail listed in the announcement or by fax. Phone requests will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The scope of the work to be acquired for the BPA is set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW). The SOW, Pricing Sheet, and BPA terms and conditions are available for download herein.</p>

<p><br />Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />a. Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for a BPA. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />FACTOR 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative applicable to each state you are providing pricing. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />FACTOR 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offer provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both. The Offeror must be a facilities based local exchange carrier. <br />FACTOR 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation IAW Clause H-829 in order to provide the services for these types of requirements. For each state Offeror is submitting pricing, the documentation must be provided.<br />b. Past Performance Evaluation. CSA award decisions will be based on the Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to price considerations. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the BPA holder's ability to perform this effort. <br />This risk assessment represents the Source Selection Authority's judgment of the probability of a BPA holder successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the BPA holder's demonstrated present and past performance. The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: High Confidence (Based on the BPA holder's performance record, the Government has high confidence the BPA holder will successfully perform the required effort); Significant Confidence (Based on the BPA holder's performance record, the Government has significant confidence the BPA holder will successfully perform the required effort); Satisfactory Confidence (Based on the BPA holder's performance record, the Government has confidence the BPA holder will successfully perform the required effort); Unknown Confidence (No performance record is identifiable); Little Confidence (Based on the BPA holder's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the BPA holder will successfully perform the required effort); and No Confidence (Based on the BPA holder's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the BPA holder will successfully perform the required effort.). If the lowest priced BPA holder is judged to have a High Confidence performance confidence assessment, that holder represents the best value for the Government, and the evaluation process stops at this point. A CSA shall issued to that BPA holder. The Government reserves the right to issue a CSA to other than the lowest priced BPA holder if the lowest priced BPA holder is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Significant Confidence" or lower. An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which BPA holder represents the best value. An award shall be made to this BPA holder, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />c. Price Evaluation. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other local exchange carrier with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: <br />Throughout the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to procure one hundred-six (106) Telephone Test Set, P/N 704A/NTS1/FAA/SS, NSN: 6625-01-540-2319-1, in support of the National FAA Test Equipment Program (NFTEP).  This equipment will replace obsolete Test Equipment currently being utilized on National Air Space System (NAS).  The purchase of the Telephone Test Sets manufactured by CXR Larus Corp. includes features, which are unique in the test industry.  The Selective Signaling 2-digit and Selective Signaling 3-digit features are required for maintaining the critical voice communications network utilized by the Air Route Traffic Control Centers in support of the NAS. These units are unique in their capability to emulate both the switch and customer equipment (station) components, meaning they can both transmit digits and receive/analyze digits.
These units are the only known equipment with this capability.  The vendor, CXR Larus Corporation, owns the proprietary technical documentation, engineering design, and the best market value for this requirement.  The FAA Logistics Center does not have any drawings or specification; therefore CXR Larus Corporation is the only known source of supply able to meet this requirement.  The Government does not have the test capability, evaluation criteria, or technical documentation available to allow other sources to manufacture these items.  
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to acquire, under single source procedures, the telephone test sets manufactured by CXR Laus Corp.  The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with CXR Larus Corporation in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.
This announcement is for information purposes only.

<DESC>The FDA is issuing a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to examine two recent medical product launches each in at least two different types of health care databases to assess the timeliness of uptake of these products by patients in each database.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to utilize the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable surveillance or queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The awardee will examine two recent medical product launches each in at least two different types of health care databases that could participate in the Sentinel Initiative in order to assess the timeliness of uptake of these products by patients in each database.  

This work will require a thorough analysis of two medical products launched within the past several years in at least two different health care databases for: (1) the number of patients identified as using each medical product each month in each health care database throughout the first year after launch; (2) a description of the patients using the product, and characteristics of that use (e.g., product strength, days supply and overall duration of use); (3) the time elapsed before 1 patient, 100 patients, 1000 patients, 10,000 patients and 100,000 patients could be identified in each database using these products; (4) identification of factors that influence the uptake of new medical products in each of the databases examined.  These analyses will be interpreted in the context of the population included and represented by the health care database to determine the generalizability of the findings to the nation as a whole.

These analyses should lead to specific recommendations for important characteristics or minimum criteria relating to medical product uptake that could be considered when evaluating health care data systems for inclusion as the Sentinel Initiative moves forward.


The Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is expected to be Full and Open.  The Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the anticipated Basis of Award is Best Value.

The primary location of performance will be at the contractors preferred location; however, the contractor will be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is: 541690  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.


This announcement is an active RFQ.  The quotation due date is September 2, 2008, at 10:00 AM, ET.  The anticipated award date is September 18, 2008.

<DESC>The FDA is issuing this Request for Quotations (RFQ) to identify and evaluate population-based data sources that could be used to study the safety of blood and tissue products in furtherance of FDAs Sentinel Initiative.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to capitalize on the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the content, quality, searchability, and responsiveness of participating data sources and/or data environments. There is a particular need to evaluate the feasibility of these data sources to study blood and tissue products.  Many blood products are administered parenterally in outpatient stand alone clinics or infusion centers, settings that are beyond traditional inpatient hospital-based services.  Because of these and other varied settings of administration (blood centers, inpatient, ambulatory surgery, outpatient prescription, etc.), accurate identification of blood product utilization will require access to data sources beyond traditional prescription or inpatient claims surveys currently available to FDA.  Likewise, useful data sources will require particular capabilities to identify infections and other adverse events in recipients of human tissue products, which may be implanted in inpatient settings, dental offices, or ambulatory surgical settings, and are not usually inventoried in typical inpatient or outpatient pharmacy systems. It is essential that FDA understand the strengths and limitations of potential Sentinel Initiative data sources in studying blood and tissue product safety.  

The primary goals are to evaluate the ability of the potential data sources and/or environments to:

(1)  Evaluate the safety of blood and tissue products.
(a)	Measure blood and tissue product usage including, but not limited to, amounts, frequencies, and indications, as well as demographics and clinical characteristics of recipients.  Enrolled populations should be representative of the US population, and usage should be comprehensive enough to cover the varied clinical indications, care settings (inpatient, outpatient, infusion center, etc.), and product types for blood and tissue products.
(b)	Calculate incidence rates of adverse events by linking blood and tissue uses to subsequent patient healthcare claims.
(c)	Evaluate potential risk factors for developing adverse events.
(d)	Assess if adverse outcomes are attributable to the administered blood or tissue product (e.g., if rates are higher than expected based on analysis of appropriate comparison group)

(2) Accurately identify exposures (procedures involving tissue or blood products) and outcomes (infections and other adverse events of interest) in covered patients, and validate these data.  

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The work requires the identification and evaluation of population-based data sources that could be used to study the safety of blood and tissue products.

This work will require a thorough analysis of each data sources: (1) utility for post-market surveillance of FDA-regulated blood and tissue products (2) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow-up, and capture of care across all settings; (4) availability, experience, and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for blood and tissue product safety surveillance as well as plans for further data source enhancements; (5) availability, experience, and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in participating in a distributed data network; (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of electronic health data; and (7) barriers that exist to including each data source in the Sentinel Initiative.  

These analyses should lead to specific evaluations of the feasibility to conduct safety related studies for blood and tissue products in each data source.

The Period of Performance will be Six Months from date of award.  The award type will be Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is Full and Open.

<DESC>Questions & Answers:

1. Clarification for "Project proposals containing restrictions on intellectual property are by nature less favorable and valuable to the government.

All responses to this RFI will be treated as proprietary material.  The statement refers to the JASP project proposal description.  

2.  Second, Is there a policy that does not allow the government to acquire technology as it would place the government in competition with industry?

The government does purchase certain aspects of a technology or data rights to it.  In my experience we would not purchase the technology in whole, but would contract with a company to further research the technology or to install, model, etc. the technology for our present/future use or for a specific purpose (aircraft, ships, weapons.....).

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this is a Request for Information (RFI).  (SECTION 1) GENERAL INFORMATION: The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, RI (NUWCNPT) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to aid the United States Navy in determining if there is sufficient industrial expertise and interest to proceed with a competitive procurement for the Common Electrical Hull Penetrator (CEHP) common diploop cable (CDC) described below.  This RFI is intended to identify concepts and sources for a CEHP CDC that can survive in a submarine sail environment.  The function of the CDC is to provide a reliable path for the transfer of critical information between outboard masts/sensors and the inboard processing equipment during at-sea missions and pier-side testing.  (SECTION 2) BACKROUND: In January 2007, NAVSEA 073R directed the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport (NUWCNPT) to begin investigating the feasibility of a Common Electrical Hull Penetrator (CEHP) to be used with all future submarine Communications, Imaging and Electronic Warfare (CI&EW) antennas and sensors.  The electrical hull penetrator (EHP) is the SUBSAFE boundary between the masts/sensors in the submarine sail and the inboard processing equipment.  The resulting study determined that with current technology, the use of a CEHP is possible.  In March 2008, NAVSEA 073R directed NUWCNPT to begin investigating near term changes to current systems and future system developments to aid in the design of a CEHP.  In addition, NUWCNPT was to look at the feasibility of a common diploop cable (CDC).  The diploop cable provides the connection between the mast/sensor and the EHP.  The diploop cable is fed through a series of rollers in either the Universal Modular Mast (UMM) or Mast Mechanical Group (MMG) which raises and lowers the masts/sensors.  Thus, constant flexing and bending of the cable should be expected.  The CEHP CDC is expected to be a purpose built, mixed conductor cable assembly consisting of coax, #12-#16 AWG copper, and fiber optic conductors, both Single Mode (SM) and Polarization Maintaining (PM).  Standard construction and pressure balanced cables will be considered.  (SECTION 3) TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CDC:  (1) The cable assembly shall not be degraded by active or passive corrosion due to leakage currents or galvanic action over a 20 year service life.  (2) CDC shall consist of the following: Qty(3) #12 AWG TSP  6 conductors, Qty(4) #16 AWG TSP  8 conductors, Qty(2)#16 AWG TST  6 conductors, Qty(3) Coax  3 conductors, Qty(1) #16 AWG Single  1 conductor, Qty(9) Fiber  9 conductors.  (3) Coax cables shall be IW 2303 or industry equivalent.  (4) The nine fiber conductors shall consist of 2 polarization maintaining (PM) fibers and 7 single mode (SM) fibers.  Mil-spec components should be used where appropriate.  Commercial telecom proven components and ruggedized components that have been developed for military applications shall be used when their specifications exceed the current Mil-spec or when no appropriate Mil-spec exists.  (5) CDC shall be prepared in a manner that offers maximum flexibility with a circular core cross section, minimum amount of twist under loading and would avoid conductor defects such as kinks and twists which would shorten cable life.  Use of fillers would be acceptable.  Circular cross section should not be altered by exposure to pressure or other testing.  (6) EMI Shield shall consist of two layers of #36 AWG tinned copper braid with 95% optical coverage, minimum.  (7) CDC shall be capable of reliably operating after being cycled through a UMM and MMG for a minimum of 10,000 cycles.  (8) The cable outer jacket shall prevent water entry under a continuous hydrostatic pressure of 1000 PSI (sea water environment).  This hydrostatic pressure shall have no detrimental effect on cable performance or electrical characteristics.  (9) The cable will be over molded with a polyurethane jacket of sufficient thickness to be resilient and resistant to tear, punctures or similar damage.  (10) The outer diameter of the cable shall not exceed 1.45 inches.  (11) The cable shall meet the cold bend requirements of MIL-C-24643 for cables having a diameter greater than .5 inches.  The conditioning temperature shall be -28C, +0C, -2C.  (12) The insulation resistance between mutually insulated conductors (excluding coaxial cables) and between any conductor and shield grounds shall be 1000 mega ohms minimum when tested in accordance with MIL-STD-202, Method 302, at 500VDC.  (13) The cable assembly conductors shall withstand, without insulation breakdown, 1000 Vrms between any mutual conductors (including shields).  (14) The operating temperature shall be -54C to +65C and the non-operating temperature shall be -62C to +71C, In addition, the cable should be capable of withstanding without failure naval vibration and underwater explosion environments. (15) Referenced Documents: PPD 802-6335747 Shock Qualification for Submarine External Components, S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG Molding and Inspection Procedure.  (SECTION 4) REQUESTED INFORMATION: This RFI is intended to gather information regarding possible technical solutions and their characteristics.  NUWCNPTs goal is to use the information collected to develop an acquisition strategy for a competitive best value acquisition.  Information desired at this time includes: (a) Proposed technical solution with/without modeling and simulation (b)Cost estimates (NRE and production) (c) Development schedule (including prototype, modeling and simulation, and production) (d) Minimum production runs  (e) Production lead times (f) Relevant experience (g) Exceptions  Identify requirements specified that will not be met (h) Identify any alternative solutions that could fulfill the Navys objectives.
