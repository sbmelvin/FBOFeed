<DESC>IFB 528A7-42-02 is issued August 23, 2002.  The solicitation will be unrestricted and issued subject to the availability of funds under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program of FAR 19.10.  This requirement was previously issued as RFP 670-35-02 and cancelled due to all proposals received exceeding the available funds.  Written or faxed requests for the solicitation are required, including company name, address, POC, telephone voice number, fax number, and e-mail address.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Work includes all labor, material, equipment and supervision necessary to construct a two story addition (4,000 square feet of basement and 6,000 square feet of ground level) of approximately 10,000 gross square feet and remodel approximately 3,500 gross square feet of ground floor space on the North face of the Medical Center to create a new Emergency Department.  After VA occupies the new Emergency Department, the final Phase of the construction will include an addition of approximately 2,000 gross square feet to the current Irving Avenue entrance to allow for improvement for pedestrian access and create a new “main” entrance to the Medical Center.  This Phase will also renovate approximately 500 gross square feet of the Irving Avenue entrance to expand the lobby and connect to the new addition on the East face of the Medical Center.  The Emergency Department Phase will be approximately 15-16 months in length.  The Irving Avenue Phase will be approximately 12 months in length.  Work includes demolition, excavation, site work, asbestos abatement, HVAC, electrical, plumbing, telecommunications wiring, erection of interior walls and finishes, fire protection, etc.  There is no scheduled site visit.

Offers with prices causing the limitation to be exceeded shall be rejected.  Sufficient alternate bid items are included in the solicitation to reduce the chances of the proposed award exceeding the limitation.

The reference book also needs to have advance searching capabilities including sophisticated Boolean and nested Boolean operations.  In addition, live equations and graphs allow users to parametrically solve for the dependent variable.  Contractors interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the Government's requirement.  In addition, the response should include any special requirements for a commercial contract (i.e., Commercial Financing, Warranty Provisions, Delivery Information, etc.) in accordance with FAR Part 12.

<DESC>PRE-Solicitation Notice:  This requirement is for the procurement of a construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for alterations of the Thomas J. McIntyre Federal Building.  The facility is approximately 10,841 gross square meters (116,692 SF).  The building consists of a four-story tower with one story postal facility adjacent to the tower and a two story-parking garage attached to the rear of the structure.  The alteration work will include, but not be limited to: modernization of office space, renovate main lobby, replacement of roof and windows, extension of sprinkler system, seismic reinforcement, miscellaneous upgrades to mechanical and electrical systems, and asbestos abatement throughout the building.  (All abatement work will be done during other than normal working hours in unoccupied areas.)  (The building will be mostly occupied throughout the project).  Work will be conducted in phases to accommodate continued occupancy of the building. The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope of construction projects with particular emphasis on complex multi-phased renovations & alterations. GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: renovation of an occupied office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) of approximately $5 million dollars or more and / or phased construction renovation projects in occupied buildings of approximately $5 million dollars or more that involve the removal of hazardous materials. The contractor's personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project. The approximate duration of the contract is 2 years. This project is designed using metric units and the estimated cost of this project is more than ten million dollars ($10,000,000).  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, qualified/experienced personnel, subcontracting opportunities, and on their price proposals. The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- Receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors. Phase 2 - Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms. In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors and the basis of GSA's opinion. GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3. Phase 3- Receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer). Phase 4 - oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range. Phase 5- negotiations and receipt and evaluation of final offers. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price. The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4. The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance: 1. Past Performance, 2. Key Personnel & Experience, and 3. Subcontracting. The NAICS code applicable to this project is 233320.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.

The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) requires Dragon Runner Mobile Ground Sensor (MGS) system product improvement development to further enhance the current MGS system capability.  After a series of urban experiments and operational assessments by MCWL, the need for greater capabilities in tactical Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) at the small unit level was deemed necessary.  Marine Company and below tactical units need an organic capability to conduct RSTA in their assigned areas of influence that cover all areas within the range of their direct fire and indirect fire organic weapons. The MGS is expected to aid the Marine in obtaining these capabilities.  MCWL had the Dragon Runner Mobile Ground Sensor built by Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute in conjunction with the Naval Research

The design and development of an electrical infrastructure, including both outboard and inboard electronics; the hardware and software required for Signal Conditioning, Signal Processing, Array Beamforming, Control and Display (GUI), and any T&E data analysis equipment; the manufacturing, integration and installation of an Advanced Development Model (ADM) or prototype. The Government is currently developing large aperture hull arrays for submarine sonar systems to supplement and/or replace existing submarine sonar arrays.  Part of the large aperture hull array effort involves developing state-of-the-art signal-proce ssing techniques that will take advantage of the large horizontal and vertical apertures provided by these arrays.  Specific goals of the effort are to take advantage of the vertical distribution of ambient noise, to capitalize on multipath signal propagation for localization, to provide extremely rapid data transmission, and to be compatible with Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion and VIRGINIA-Class non-propulsion electronics system architecture.  A brief presentation of currently contemplated array development projects may be found at <www.asto-nav.com>, the ASTO web site.  The expected result is an extremely affordable, high performance electronic infrastructure and processing system that will enable the design, development and integration of a large aperture hull array into the overall submarine sonar suite. Proposed efforts may address specific areas or components where offe rors wish to participate or may address the entire scope. Where multiple areas are proposed, proposals should be structured so that each area identified above is separately delineated. Proposed effort must have the potential for demonstrating the required performance and/or affordability improvement against the defined threats in the specified environments.   This BAA will be open for 2 years from the data of the announcement.  Proposals may be submitted at any time within that period.  Contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and "other transactions", as appropriate, will be awarded limited by funding availability. .  The funding in FY03 (if available) is $2,000,000.  Funding in FY04 (if available) is $3,000,000.  Therefore, early submission of proposals is desirable and encouraged.  The Navy desires initial awards no later than 15 February 2003. Contractors may submit  study proposals.  Studies, if proposed, should identify innovative solutions, technologies, cost drivers, and development approaches suitable for demonstration within 24 months from award. No award can be made without a proposal to perform a specific effort within an estimated cost and time period.  Industry, Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, educational institutions, Historically Black Colleges and University and Minority Institutions are encouraged to participate. Proposals should be submitted to the Cognizant Contracting Activity whose address is: COMMANDER NAVAL SEA SYSTEMS COMMAND ATTN SEA 02632 (LT Michael Carl) 1333 ISAAC HULL AVENUE SE STOP 2050 WASHINGTON NAVY YARD DC 20376-2050 Contracting Point-of-Contact is LT Michael Carl, telephone (202)781-4924, facsimile (202)781-4653 and e-mail <carlms@navsea.navy.mil>.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Advanced Technology Center (ATC) plans to procure the Atto Bioscience Pathway HT system from Atto Bioscience 15010 Broschart Road, Rockville, Maryland 20850.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.5.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  Researchers at the NCI Advanced Technology Center require the capability of studying living cells under a variety of conditions. These studies will include drug screening assays, cell microarrays, inhibitory small RNA (RNA1) studies, and so on. The Atto HT system fulfills these requirements at several levels. The unique spinning disk confocal capability allows high-throughput 3D structural analysis of samples and improves signal-to-noise ratios allowing the system to perform homogeneous assays. For drug screening this capability enables us the unique opportunity to analyze live cells upon drug addition using the on-stage liquid handling system contained within its climate controlled environmental chamber. The Pathway HT uses a proprietary optical path, which allows the 96 or 384 well plate to remain stationary while the high-resolution optics move independently from well to well. This important feature allows the researcher working with non-adherent cells to track individual cells throughout the duration of the assay. The flexibility of the two mercury arc lamps and binocular viewing allows full spectrum (340nm-700nm) real time viewing in cell arrays, tissue slides and tissue arrays. Finally, the Pathway HT software is capable of running the system in both a fully automated or manual mode, which is important for assay development and studies requiring 3D reconstruction of cellular events.  Minimum Requirements:  1) full-spectrum capability (340nm to near-IR) using 16 excitation and 8 emission filters with independent dichroic mirror selection, 2) autofocus and auto cell identification/tracking, 3) switchable between confocal and widefield viewing modes, 4) capable of imaging both cells or tissues, 5) rapid multiple wavelength viewing, 6) kinetic or end-point measurements, 7) multiple plate slide and tissue array configurations (96, 384, chamber slides, microscope slides), 8) versatile liquid handling with mixing, 9) motorized high resolution X, Y, Z , and; 10) stationary stage with proprietary optical path.  Atto Biosciences is the only source known to the NCI that can supply the Pathway HT system that allows the screening of live cells in a 96 or 384 well format. Also, cells can be analyzed continuously by a fluorescent confocal single-cell imaging system, giving the researcher the ability to measure multiple cellular events in real-time and in 3-Dimensional (3-D) space. The NCI ATC can use the Pathway HT system in drug screening assays, loss of function retroviral RNA1 studies and cell arrays. This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on September  4, 2002.   If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), Community Oncology and Prevention Trials Research Group (COPTRG), plans to procure services from the University of North Carolina, Schepps Institute, Office of Sponsored Research, 440 W. Franklin Street, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599.  The supplies and services herein are defined as  commercial and are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  In September 1983, the National Cancer Institute launched the Community Clinical Oncology Program as a mechanism for disseminating state-of-the-art cancer treatments and patient management techniques to community oncologists and their patients.  Spurred by congressional concern that the billions of dollars being spent on cancer research were having only minimal impact on cancer incidence and mortality, this program sought to accelerate the transfer of research findings to local settings by funding community-based consortia of oncologists and hospitals (CCOPs) to enroll patients in clinical trials.  The CCOPs were required to affiliate with NCI-supported clinical cooperative groups and cancer centers and to enroll a minimum of 50 patients annually on the cancer treatment protocols developed by these "research bases."  As the Community Clinical Oncology Program approaches its 20th anniversary, it is important to evaluate the extent to which Cancer Prevention and Control CP/C research has attained legitimacy and long-term viability within CCOP research bases.  The range of CP/C protocols being designed by CCOP research bases and the success of several large chemoprevention trials suggest that the Community Clinical Oncology Program has been a highly effective catalyst for developing and implementing CP/C intervention research.  However, relatively little is known about the structural and strategic adaptations that research bases and CCOPs have made to integrate CP/C research into their missions and operations, or the reasons why some research bases and CCOPs have made faster progress.   The Community Clinical Oncology Program has three objectives: 1)  To assess the extent to which CP/C research has been integrated into clinical cooperative groups and the factors contributing to institutionalization; 2) To assess the extent to which CCOPs have been integrated into the scientific and policy-making activities of clinical cooperative groups and the factors contributing to institutionalization and 3) To assess the effectiveness of the Community Clinical Oncology Program in facilitating development of, and community participation in, CP/C intervention research.  The study will examine the process of integrating CP/C research and CCOPs into the subsystems of clinical cooperative groups, the challenges encountered, and current levels of institutionalization.   Period of Performance: Upon award of purchase order through 12 months.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) applies to this order. The University of North Carolina, Schepps Center is the only known source to the NCI that  has served as the prime contractor for a multi-year evaluation of the Community Clinical Oncology Program.  The Schepps Center has both quantitative and qualitative data from the CCOP-II evaluation that can be used as a baseline for analyzing the extent to which cancer prevention and control (CP/C) research has been integrated into clinical cooperative groups and changes in CCOP accruals to CP/C intervention studies over the past ten years.  While conducting the CCOP-II evaluation, the Schepps Center established strong working relationships with CCOPs and clinical cooperative groups that facilitate the scheduling and conduct of interviews.  These prior working relationships also will eliminate the need for extensive background research on CCOPs and clinical cooperative groups.  The requirement will be of a fixed price nature, procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.   The capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, (local Washington, D.C. time) September 4, 2002.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax at 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Morocco:  Azzemour Wastewater Treatment and Reuse Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a wastewater treatment and reuse project in the city of Azzemour.

The city of Azzemour is located 70 kilometers south of Casablanca on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, at the mouth of the Oum Errabia River.  Azzemour has an estimated population of 40,000 residents, who discharge an average of 7,134 m3 of wastewater per day into the river.  The tides prevent the effluents from being properly flushed out to the ocean.  In 1998, the city conducted a sanitation study of its sewage system with the following objectives:  (1) assess the network for the kasba and the new medina, (2) study the areas where the sewage network should be expanded, (3) study treatment options, and (4) prepare terms of reference for the sewage network repairs and extension.  The study concluded that:

--The city's sewage will be transported by gravity to the newly planned wastewater treatment plant, on the west bank of the river;
--The type of treatment system projected is mechanical and biological treatment with lagoons and sand filters; and
--The planned treatment system will meet French standards and effluent concentrations for irrigation.
  
Additional treatment technologies, however, will be necessary to produce water of sufficient quality for irrigating the green spaces of a planned resort complex in Azzemour.  The resort will be located in an area overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, the Oum Errabia river estuary, and the old walled city.  Plans for the resort have been drawn and potential financing has been identified.  However, one of the key constraints for this project moving forward is the availability of water.

The initial study undertaken by the Province of El Jadida estimated the project cost at $3.5 million.  However, the proposed technology for the Azzemour wastewater treatment plant is considered insufficient to produce water of adequate quality for the irrigation of green spaces for the golf course and resort.  Further treatment steps are needed and are likely to require an additional $1.5 million in materials and services.  

The objective of this study is to assess the prospects for constructing a wastewater treatment plant for the city of Azzemour and to reuse the treated wastewater for irrigation.  The study tasks are summarized as follows:  1.1) Data collection on Azzemour?s environment, analyze existing data water characterization, 1.2) Develop alternatives for wastewater treatment, 1.3) Evaluate alternatives and develop preliminary implementation, 2.1) Detailed study of the selected option, 2.2) Environmental assessment, 2.3) Develop implementation plan, 2.4) Prepare financing and cost recovery strategy, 3.1) Final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $200,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and in French directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M. local Moroccan time on Monday, October 7, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the most current Federal Acquisition Circular.  The standard industrial classification code is 3571.   The acquisition is as follows:

Link-16 Ground Station with criteria as follows:  1) Basic Configuration ? The ground station must consist of a Personal Computer or Unix Workstation.  The ground station must be able to communicate using a MIL-STD-1553 communications bus to a Link-16 MIDS LVT(1), Platform 1 terminal, a fighter data link MIDS LVT(3) terminal, and a F-15 Class II terminal.  The station must be configured with a removable hard drive, an RW-CDROM, and a large-viewing area monitor.  A two-monitor setup is preferable;  2) Station Roles ? The ground station must simulate a host to the three different terminals, including the ability to load initialization data and send/receive Link-16 common-carrier messages.  It must be able to monitor the health status of the terminal including loopback statuses, BIT statuses, overtemp status and other key parameters of the terminals.  It must be able to monitor and modify critical initialization parameters such as station position, power levels, NTR status, etc.  Modified initialization parameters must be storable to a disk file such that future initialization loads do not require modifications.  Must be able to import and view JNDL network files.  The ground station must be able to emulate the MIDS LVT(1), Platform 1 terminal;  3) User Interface ? Must be a point and click mouse interface or equivalent.  Many actions will have to be accomplished real-time during flight test.  Speed is important!  Displays and windows must be snappy with no delays;  4) Scenario Generation ? Must be capable of producing a wide array of Link-16 messages including simulated ground and air targets.  All Link-16 messages from MIL-STD-6016A (including STANAG 5516), including recent ICPs must be supported including full implementation of U.S. only messages (J28.2).  All parameters defined for a J-Msg must be updateable.  The target must be programmable into different movement patterns (straight line, circles, figure 8?s).  Realistic messaging for events (target ID, hand-off, drop target, A-G targeting, etc) must be provided for as programmable events and as real-time operator actions.  The targets and messages must be contained within programmable scenarios.  Scenarios must be restart-able in less than 30 seconds;  5) Message Monitoring ?

Messages must be displayed using a decoding database based upon MIL-STD-6016A (including STANAG 5516) with recent ICPs;  6) Data Logging/Analysis ? Must be able to log all out-going and incoming J-message traffic to a disk file.  The file format would preferably hold raw 1553 traffic data.  However, decoded J-messages in an ascii format would also be acceptable.  The data must be time tagged using terminal time (not PC system time);  7) Maintenance and Support ? Must be able to provide software fixes for any software bugs found.  Must be able to deliver regular updates to the J-Msg decoding function to keep current with MIL-STD 6016A (including STANAG 5516) ICPs; and 8) Delivery Date ?

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Advanced Technology Center (ATC) plans to procure from BD Biosciences, 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA 95131 the upgrade of their Government owned BD FACSCalibur System to add a BD FACSCalibur Multiwell Autosampler and BD FACSCalibur sorting upgrade.  The ATC performs a variety of research functions which include:  1) providing several different kinds of microarrays to the NCI;  2) helping with DNA sequencing of genes; 3) providing SNP analysis of the human genome;  4) developing new molecular and cellular technologies for the NCI; and 5)  providing technical guidance to all NCI researchers in many areas. The upgrade will allow for the removal of samples from 96 or 384 well plates and sort cells into individual tubes allowing the isolation of homogenous sets of cells.  The sorter mechanism involves a mechanical catcher rather than droplet formation, and this allows collection to take place in a closed environment so no aerosols are formed, making sorting of biohazardous samples safer.  This system is being integrated into the ATC existing BD FACSCaliber System and it is important that the upgrade be designed specifically for the existing equipment and that none of the existing warranties of this system be voided when this system is upgraded.  This equipment is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 p.m. EDT, on August 29, 2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) has a requirement to conduct a study of phenotypic and genetic variation in Maine DPS salmon at Craig Brook National Fish Hatchery (CBNFH).  The ultimate goal of this work is to aid in establishing an integrated life history trait monitoring program to supplement existing micro-satellite analysis as a central element in the conservation genetics of the Maine DPS salmon.  The specific objectives of the proposed work are:  To quantify phenotypic trait variation within and among the Gulf of Maine DPS salmon populations at CBNFH; To examine correlations between phenotypic trait diversity and diversity at micro-satellite markers (e.g., do populations with less micro-satellite variation also show less phenotypic variation?); To estimate the heritable basis of life history trait variation in Maine DPS salmon and; To determine if salmon culled using micro-satellite assignment schemes actually significantly differ from DPS salmon in their phenotypic traits consistent with the need to cull them at the risk of losing local diversity.  The proposed work will consist of two years of replicated measurement so as to account for inter-annual variation.  However, in performing this work, the contractor will develop a long-term trait measurement and monitoring program at CBNFH that will complement current micro-satellite approaches in conserving the adaptive diversity of these populations. Reporting requirements shall take three forms- briefings, semi-annual reports, and annual reports. The period of performance shall be September 23, 2002 through September 22, 2003.   Place of performance shall be National Marine Fisheries Service, Northeast Fisheries Science Center, Maine Field Station, P. O. Box 190, 31 Main Street, Orono, ME.  Copies of the solicitation will only be provided in response to written or faxed requests received directly from the requestor.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  Requests for copies of the solicitation may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  The solicitation document will be issued on or about August 28, 2002.  All responsible parties may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: an outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed and published in peer-reviewed literature or being performed and any in-house research and development effort; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist and technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project officer; (3) Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration and location relative to CBNFH.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The solicitation is revised to clarify the 10-mile radius requirement by incorporating Technical Exhibit 1. 	2.  Under the statement of work, it says that the Government will not pay more than the per diem for Fayetteville, just to confirm, this is per diem, PER soldier (for double occupancy purposes)? 	RESPONSE:  Correct.  This is for the per diem rate, per person for the Fayetteville area. 	3.

RESPONSE:  Ensure that if you choose to submit a proposal, it must meet all of the specifications, terms and conditions contained in the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  No facilities proposed outside of the 10-mile radius will be considered for award.  F acilities proposed within the limit will be considered.

<DESC>AMENDMENT.  THE DESCRIPTION OF WORK IS CHANGED TO INCLUDE REPAIR OF THE TEAK EAGLE FIGUREHEAD, AND GOLD LEAFING OF THE STERN WORK AS WELL AS THE FIGUREHEAD. QUOTE DUE DATE IS EXTENDED UNTIL 1 JULY 2002.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  A written solicitation will not be issued. This announcement is the solicitation, and quotations are being requested. The solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  The RFQ number is DTCG80-02-Q-3FAF03.  The RFQ incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-06.  This is a small business set-aside procurement.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 339950, and the size standard is 500 employees. This requirement is to renew the wooden name board and decorative scrollwork mounted on the stern of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter EAGLE.  The wooden name board is mounted on the centerline of the stern and is approximately 10 feet long, 2 feet high and 6 inches thick.  It is wrapped in carved wood rope that extends approximately 15 feet in both outboard directions wrapping around the stern.  The teak rope is then intertwined with carvings of dolphins and waves.   The new name board and carvings must be identical in appearance to the existing name board and carvings.  The material shall be European Grade Teak with a moisture content of no more than 15 per cent.  Teak laminates may be used.  The contractor shall be available at the U.S. Coast Guard Yard in October 2002 to assist in removal of the old name board and carvings.  The new name board and carvings must be available for installation by March 1, 2003.  The contractor shall be available at the Coast Guard Yard during reinstallation to make adjustments necessary for final fit-up.  Potential offerors shall demonstrate their ability to produce woodcarvings of this quality by providing photographs and three references for similar work done previously.  Offerors shall also submit a manufacturing plan that describes the process for wood selection, laminate manufacture, wood carving, wood finishing and ship installation.  Digital pictures of the existing name board and carvings are available, however it is highly recommended that potential offerors visit the vessel for inspection.

This will be a Firm-Fixed Price purchase order. Quotes shall address all requirements in this combined synopsis/solicitation, and shall provide clear evidence of understanding, and the ability and willingness to comply with the Government's requirement.  Failure to address a specification requirement will be construed by the Government as inability to meet the need, or the offeror's taking exception to it. The Government anticipates awarding one purchase order resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to this synopsis/solicitation will offer the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. Quotations will be evaluated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)Subpart 13.106-2-Evaluation of quotations or offers. Award will be made based on vendors' (A) Manufacturing Capability of the offeror to meet the Governments requirement; (B) Past Performance; (C) Ability to meet Delivery Schedule, and (D) Price.

<DESC>This announcement modifies previous synopsis/solicitation N68936-02-T-0242 which was issued 21 August 2002.  The following changes have been made: This is an FULL and OPEN COMPETITION, unrestricted, not a small business set aside.  The Quantity for CLIN 0004 was omitted and is as follows: The minimum quantity is 10 each; the maximum quantity is 720 each.  Order limitation is as follows: The maximum number of disks ordered in a given 48 hour period would be 50 each of a CLIN or combined CLINS.  Regarding possible obsolete or discontinued items, a larger disk storage size may be quoted, but the SCSI interface and connector configuration is required as specified for each CLIN.  The 7200-RPM is a minimum and the Government will accept a 10000-RPM or 15000-RPM drive if the 7200-RPM is not available.  The correct response date is 22 Sept 2002.  Clarifications are provided for the following questions:  Question: do we want a particular brand name? Answer: NO.  Any hard drive meeting the requirements is acceptable.  The best value evaluation does include evaluation of reliability and quality.  Question: what are the hard drives for? Answer: The hard drives will be run on RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors SGI (Silicon Graphics Inc), HP (Hewlett Packard) and Sun using respective UNIX OS (operating system).  Question: are the dimensions provided for the hard drives accurate? Answer: Yes.  The 4" size specified is the external physical dimension.  The disk platter size may be smaller (e.g. 3.5"). Question: is it correct that there are different quantities for each CLIN? Answer: this is correct.  There are different maximum quantities for each CLIN.  The minimum of 10 each is the same for all.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation that shall be considered by the agency.  These responses shall be submitted in writing to Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Code 210000D, Building 20259, Attention Peggy Richter, China Lake, CA 93555-6100 or by email to: richterpa@navair.navy.mil.  NOTE 12 applies.

<DESC>This amendment is being made for typographical changes.  An extension to this notice is not warranted.  The respons date remains the same.  This is a complete replacement of NEEK3000-2-00160 a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with the Public Law 103-355 (41 U.S.C. 264 note), and the information below is expressed as a statement of need for a commercial item, as outlined in FAR 12.202.  This acquisition will be procured IAW the simplified acquisition procedures outlined in FAR 13.106.  The intent of this synopsis is also to describe the required commercial items through the process described in FAR subpart 11.002.  Additionally, it is the intent of NOAA to tailor the provision of FAR 52.212-1 and 52.212-4 to include addenda to the terms, estimated to include inspection and acceptance provisions?if applicable to commercial practices.  FAR 52.212-2 will be used for evaluation purposes, and will be supplemented by Factors (a), (b), and (c), below.  Evaluation criteria are used for the determination of technical suitability, which is compliance with the specification for the DRGPS in Attachment 1 (under separate cover).  Compliance is necessary for any favorable award determination.  Therefore, the Government will evaluate: (a) the Offeror's compliance with these specifications (you must request Attachment 1 from the Contract Specialist).  The Offerors must demonstrate through a compliance matrix that they either comply or take exception to the specified requirements in Attachment 1.  Use of the appropriate commercial literature is acceptable in tandem with the compliance matrix.  If an exception is taken, the Offeror must explain how it can otherwise meet the performance requirements; (b) the Offeror's past performance will be evaluated for similarity and recentness of the referenced buy, and the Contractor's overall performance, including meeting the delivery schedule and reliability of the equipment (submit three past performance references for the same or similar units, delivered over the past three years, including price/unit, technical and business points of contact and telephone numbers); and (c) the warranty terms must be submitted and will be evaluated for their appropriateness to sustaining the Government's mission requirements and avoiding service discontinuity.  Price will not be scored, but will become more important if technical scores are relatively equal. Prices will be reviewed, however, for reasonableness and realism.  Factors will be allocated with the following weights: (a) Compliance with Specifications: 70%, (b) Past Performance: 20%, and (c) Warranty Terms: 10%.  Determination for ward will be based on an integrated assessment of these technical factors with price. Quoted items must be priced to include ALL direct and indirect costs, and other direct costs not elsewhere specified, for the following firm-fixed-price line items: (A) Dual Redundant GPS Receive Systems; Quantity: 5 (each); Price (per unit): $ (to be quoted?TBQ); (B) Chassis Type I: Frequency Distribution; Quantity 6 (ea); Price (per unit) $ TBQ; (C) Chassis Type II: Time Code Distribution; Quantity 10 (ea); Price (per unit) $ TBQ; (D) 6 (ea) Spare Fault Sensing and Power Supply modules; Price/unit (ea) $ TBQ; (E) Optional Warranty Extension, each unit, at $ TBQ.  The overall evaluated price must include submission of all priced quantities. The Government is not obligated to order any options. The F.O.B. Destination delivery point is NEDSIS, Suitland, MD (TBD).  The Government shall install the units, therefore no installation costs should be proposed. Constructive acceptance, and the start of any warranty, shall not occur until 30 days after delivery of the unit(s), following Government installation and test. Offerors must include a complete copy of the Representation and Certifications in FAR 52.212-3. FAR 52.212-5 applies to the acquisition and is incorporated. The contact person below will provide the Attachment 1 and the FAR 52.212-5 document, with the appropriate checked blocks, upon request by e-mail. Other terms and conditions are as follows:

<DESC>This is a special notice issued by Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), management and operating contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina.  WSRC wishes to determine public interest in licensing for commercial applications a new method of phosphate-amended bioventing or biosparging that provides a cost-effective, controllable alternative for remediating sites contaminated with metals.  The new PrecipiPHOS (TM) method provides a carbon feed source and a phosphate nutrient that enable the in situ growth of microbes.  The gaseous organo-phosphorus nutrient mixture is introduced into the contaminated zone via injection wells.  As microbes feed on the nutrient mixture, they produce inorganic phosphates as a byproduct of the digestive process.  The inorganic phosphates stabilize metals present in the contaminated zone through precipitation, co-precipitation, or adsorption.  The new method is useful in treating dissolved metals, metals sorbed to soils, and radionuclides.  The method can be used in soil, groundwater, or both and can treat metal contaminants over a far greater range of conditions than traditional methods.  WSRC has filed a provisional U.S. patent application on this invention.  For more information on the PrecipiPHOS environmental remediation technology and licensing opportunities, contact Joseph P. Dugan, telephone (803) 725-0848 or (800) 228-3843, Fax: (803) 725-4988, email: joseph.dugan@srs.gov, or address: Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Building 773-41A, Room #243, Aiken, SC  29808.  Responses to this notice should be received by September 23, 2002.  This is not a request for a formal subcontract; it is a request for interested parties and licensing opportunities only.

<SUBJECT>A -- RFI Announcement HyperSoar
<DESC>RFI Announcement HyperSoar     This is a Request for Information (RFI) and is being released by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.     The goal of this RFI is to obtain information on innovative technology solutions that will help develop a hypersonic, reusable global reach capability from the Continental Unites States (CONUS). Specifically, DARPA is interested in a promising concept for hypersonic, reusable global reach known as HyperSoar. Unique aspects of HyperSoar are the ability to fly periodic trajectories at the outer edge of the Earth's atmosphere (115,000 ft - 200,000 ft) to improve fuel consumption and reduce average thermal loading over the mission. The high L/D aircraft would fly at speeds up to Mach 10 using hydrogen-based propulsion, accelerating out of the atmosphere and gliding back into the atmosphere.     This hypersonic periodic trajectory flight path, when compared to traditional level cruise flight paths, should result in greater mission radius and reduced thermal management requirements. Technical challenges associated with the HyperSoar concept may be periodic trajectory flight control, combined-cycle accelerator propulsion, cyclic thermal stress management approaches, and highly integrated airframe/propulsion integration concepts.   Responses to this RFI need not address the entire system but can focus on technological solutions to any of the technical challenges listed above or others not listed here. Information items of particular interest are innovative aircraft/propulsion vehicle concepts, concepts of employment, modeling and simulation, rocket-based and turbine-based combined cycle or other innovative propulsion technologies, thermal protection systems, periodic trajectory optimization and flight control, engine/airframe system integration, and lightweight, low cost airframe technologies.     Companies responding to this announcement will receive e-mail information on details of future program solicitations, directions and industry day announcements.  Please be advised that all responses to this RFI will be treated as proprietary information and it will not be considered as a proposal.  Any technical information submitted in response to this RFI is voluntary.  Responses should be digitally submitted and can be mailed or e- mailed to Dr. Steven H. Walker, DARPA Program Manager, at DARPA, TTO, 3701 N Fairfax Dr, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 or swalker@DARPA.mil, respectively.  Maximum of 10 page responses should be received no later than COB 23 September 2002.

<DESC>The USCG Engineering Logistics Center has a requirement to Modify Fuel Control Systems on Coast Guard Polar Icebreakers as follows: 1. Background: 1.1 Over the past 5 years the Polar Class Icebreakers have been plagued with frequent emergency stops of the their Main Gas Turbines (MGTs) during icebreaking operations. These shutdowns have seriously degraded the icebreaking capability and in turn the mission effectiveness of the POLAR STAR & SEA.  The current version of the fuel control systems (SPC2-D) does not provide operators and shipboard technicians with the cause of these failures.  This was remedied in later years of production through means of a readout display, mounted on the SPC2-D itself, which indicated the responsible parameter.  Since the Coast Guard?s earlier versions do not possess this important feature, an after market modification is required.  2. Requirement:  2.1 The contractor shall modify a SPC2-D fuel control system to provide the operator with troubleshooting information.  This upgrade will be mounted directly on the SPC2-D and utilize LEDs as readout medium.  Upon emergency stop the readout shall indicate to the user the reason for the shutdown.  This upgrade shall be in accordance with Wood Group Pratt and Whitney Service Change #03026. 2.2 Upon completion of the modification, the contractor shall recalibrate the SPC2-D and verify proper operation of the indication LEDs.  3. GFE: 3.1 The government shall provide 6 SPC2-Ds for upgrade. 4. Schedule:  4.1 Upon award, NESU Seattle will ship four SPC2-D fuel controls to the contractor in Windsor Locks, CT.  4.2 The contractor shall, at their facilities, perform the upgrade and a complete a recalibration on four SPC2-Ds.    4.3 Upon completion of the repairs, these first four fuel controls will be shipped to NESU Seattle, c/o: EMCM Isherwood.  The return of the first four completed fuel controls shall occur on or before 30 Sept 02. 4.4 After receipt of the first four upgraded fuel controls, and after the arrival of POLAR STAR inport (OOA:07 OCT 02), NESU Seattle will ship the remaining two SPC2-D fuel controls to the contractor.4.5 The contractor shall perform the same modification and recalibration on these last two fuel controls and ship them back to NESU Seattle.
