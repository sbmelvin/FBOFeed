<DESC>1. GENERAL: This is a non-personnel services contract to provide Industrial Water Treatment (IWT) of Closed Loop hot and chilled water systems on Kunsan Air Force Base as defined in this Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Government will not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein. Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn in responsible to the Government.
<p>1.1. Description of Services/Introduction: The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, equipment, tools, expendable materials, transportation, and other items and services, necessary to perform Industrial Water Treatment (IWT) of closed loop hot and chilled water systems services, as defined in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) at Kunsan Air Base (AB). The facilities requiring these services are listed in Technical Exhibit (TE) #1, Workload Estimates (Facility Listing).</p>
<p>5. SPECIFIC TASKS:</p>
<p>5.1. Monthly Water Treatment and Analysis: The contractor shall analyze and treat the water of existing water distribution systems for hot water boilers and chilled water systems so that this water is maintained according to the Recommended Parameters of Each System in the TE #2. Note that these parameters in TE #2 are listed only so as to give the contractor guidelines, and the appropriate values are a function of the condition of make-up water. The contractor shall make all necessary efforts to maintain those parameters at the appropriate value through frequent make-up water analysis (i.e., seasonally) and treat the water accordingly. Any significant changes to these parameters shall be brought to the attention of the COR in writing, and the COR must provide written approval if no further treatment is to be made to adjust a parameter that has undergone a reported significant change.</p>
<p>5.1.1. The contractor shall be responsible for the type of chemicals and dosing quantities selection based on the water volume of the system. The chemicals (such as scale &amp; corrosion inhibitors or oxygen scavengers) shall be industrially proven in their performance and commonly used for closed heating and cooling systems.</p>
<p>5.1.2. The water sample shall be taken from the proper system sampling point and the contractor is responsible for wearing all protective devices and clothing while taking samples.</p>
<p>5.1.3. After analysis of before- and after-service water samples, the contractor shall submit a water analysis report to the COR within 7 working days of the next performance month. The water analysis report shall include, but not be limit to, data on the treated facilities' building number, sampling date, parameter values before and after treatment, and chemical types and their quantities used for treatments. If the recommended parameter values could not be achieved within a reasonable amount servicing due to existing system problems, the contractor shall report the reason for this failed service and any system irregularities (i.e., piping leak, system being labeled "out of service," etc.) for the government's remedy. The Recommended Record Forms is attached in TE #3. The list of facilities requiring these services are attached in TE #1.</p>
<p>5.1.4. The contractor shall use proven and calibrated water analyzers whenever sampled water is analyzed. Calibration data and frequencies are to be submitted to the COR. The analyzer shall be tested and certified to have calibration traceability back to an internationally recognized testing organization and the contractor shall provide this analyzer's certification or test report. If multiple analyzers are to be used, test reports and/or certificates shall be provided for each respective analyzer. These certifications shall be at least within a year of the measurements performed for this task, unless there are documented manufacturer recommendations that a longer period between calibrations is acceptable.</p>
<p>5.1.5. Leak Reports: The contractor shall report any leak within the mechanical room and/or in or around the area of the central heating and cooling system immediately upon finding. The report shall include, but not limit to, the facility number, a photo taken of the leaked, the date the leak or damage was discovered, detail information of the area (i.e., 4" hot water supply line 80 cm from hot water pump discharge), and recommended action to be taken.</p>
<p>5.1.6. The contractor shall be responsible for the removal of all hazardous waste that might be generated during the performance of this contract. And contractor shall contact COR immediately upon hazardous waste finding at the job site.</p>
<p>5.2. Water Volume Check: Whenever a water distribution system is changed or a new water system is installed, the contractor shall check the new water volume before deciding the initial quantities of chemicals. This work will be authorized separately by an issued delivery order from the contracting office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EXHIBIT #2<br />RECOMMENDED WATER PARAMETERS OF EACH SYSTEM</p>
<p>Note: As stated in the PWS 5.1, these parameters and recommendations are to be used as guidelines. These recommendations are the excerpt from the Industrial Water Treatment Primer formerly known as Air Force Instruction (AFI) 91-40, published by the Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency (AFCESA). Based on make-up analysis and the condition of each system, each parameters and programs might be changed to apply the program more effectively. The contractor shall be responsible to update and validate those parameters regularly to give the Government's system the best corrosion/scale/other factor's rate to extend life cycle for all hot and chilled water systems in the Kunsan Air Base.</p>
<p><br />HOT WATER HEATING SYSTEMS</p>
<p>A. GENERAL</p>
<p>A water treatment program for a hot water heating system is less complicated and less demanding than the treatment program for a steam heating system. Unlike a steam system, a hot water system is a closed system and does not require blow-down; therefore, system makeup should not exceed 5% of the system's volume/year. The chemicals used in a hot water system are retained within the system, making it cost-effective and easier to maintain.</p>
<p>The following tasks should be accomplished before a water treatment program is initiated for a hot water heating system.</p>
<p>1. Make sure the system is free of leaks.</p>
<p>2. Install a backflow prevention device in the makeup water line.</p>
<p>3. Install a metering device.</p>
<p>4. Install a sample cooling coil.</p>
<p>5. Install a chemical feed system.</p>
<p>6. Install dielectric unions.</p>
<p><br />B. TYPES OF HOT WATER SYSTEMS</p>
<p>Low/medium temperature water systems do not require pretreatment of the makeup water unless the total hardness exceeds 50 ppm as CaCO3.</p>
<p>Three treatment programs developed for closed systems are:</p>
<p>1. Sulfite-caustic soda program.</p>
<p>2. Nitrite-borax program.</p>
<p>3. Molybdate-caustic program.</p>
<p>Nitrite-borax and molybdate-caustic treatment programs are usually the programs of choice for low/medium temperature systems because they are very effective at temperatures below 250oF. The treatment program is selected based on the metals in the heating system and the cost of the treatment program. Factors influencing the cost of a program include the size of the system, the amount of makeup water required, and the environmental or health restrictions.</p>
<p>High temperature water (HTW) systems operate at 350oF to 420oF. The major concern for this system is to prevent scale deposition in the boiler tubes. Water softeners should be installed to remove 100% of the hardness contributing minerals from the makeup water. Scale on boiler tubes in a HTW system can lead to tube rupture or a boiler explosion. The chemical treatment program most often used for a HTW system is the sulfite-caustic soda program.</p>
<p><br />C. TREATMENT PROGRAMS</p>
<p>1. Nitrite-Borax Treatment Program</p>
<p>a. For the initial dosage, add approximately 18 lbs of sodium nitrite-borax for every 1000 gallons of water in the system. Enough sodium nitrite-borax should be added to sustain a nitrite residual of 1000 ppm as nitrite (NO2).</p>
<p>b. Maintain a nitrite residual of 600 to 1000 ppm.</p>
<p>c. Add sodium carbonate to maintain the pH at 8.5 to 9.5.</p>
<p>d. Check pH and analyze the system water to determine the nitrite content 24 hours after initiating treatment.</p>
<p>e. Make necessary adjustments, if needed.</p>
<p>2. Molybdate-Caustic Soda Treatment Program</p>
<p>a. For the initial dosage, add approximately 12 lbs of sodium molybdate for every 1000 gallons of water in the system. Enough sodium molybdate should be added to sustain a molybdate residual of 125 ppm as MoO4.</p>
<p>b. Maintain a Molybdate residual of 100 to 125 ppm.</p>
<p>c. Add sodium hydroxide to maintain the pH at 8.5 to 9.5.</p>
<p>d. Check pH and analyze the system water to determine the molybdate content 24 hours after initiating treatment.</p>
<p>e. Make necessary adjustments, if needed.</p>
<p>3. Sulfite-Caustic Soda Treatment Program</p>
<p>a. For the initial dosage, add approximately 1 lb of sodium sulfite and 2 lbs of sodium hydroxide for every 1000 gallons of water in the system.</p>
<p>b. Maintain a sodium sulfite residual of 50 to 100 ppm as SO3.</p>
<p>c. Add sodium hydroxide to maintain the pH at 9.0 to 10.0.</p>
<p>d. Check pH and analyze the system water to determine the sulfite content 24 hours after initiating treatment.</p>
<p>e. Make necessary adjustments, if needed</p>
<p>CHILLED WATER SYSTEM</p>
<p><br />A. GENERAL</p>
<p>Protection of closed recirculating water systems generally features a high pH which is most often held between 8.5 and 9.5. Corrosion of mild steel is reduced substantially at high pH. However, systems with unresolved leaks can expect scale deposits if the hardness mineral content in the makeup water is high. Within this narrow pH range, the choice of corrosion inhibitor is more limited than for open systems.</p>
<p>The most common corrosion inhibitor for chilled water systems is referred to as boron nitrite. It uses borax as a buffering agent to maintain a pH above 8.5 and usually contains a variety of corrosion inhibitors that includes sodium nitrite, sodium silicate, and copper corrosion inhibitor.</p>
<p>Though rather effective, this treatment is not without shortcomings. Both the boron and nitrite are toxic to humans and cannot be used in food-processing plants. Nitrite is an excellent nutrient for bacteria growth. If bacteria enter this system, it can destroy the nitrite, produce low pH levels, and produce slime deposits as well. Finally, if air enters the system at points such as pump seals, nitrite converts to nitrate, which is not as effective for corrosion control.</p>
<p>Molybdate-based treatments have found recent use with considerable success. They often contain copper corrosion inhibitors and occasionally an alkali buffering agent to maintain pH above 8.0. The molybdate is maintained at levels of 100-200 ppm (as MoO4). This treatment is not toxic, is environmentally acceptable, and does not contribute to biological growth.</p>
<p>B. TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR CHILLED WATER SYSTEMS</p>
<p>1. Nitrite-Borax.</p>
<p>a. Soften makeup water if hardness is over 250 ppm as CaCO3.</p>
<p>b. Maintain 600-1000 ppm as NO2.</p>
<p>c. Add sodium carbonate to maintain a pH range of 8.5 to 9.5.</p>
<p>d. Prevent degradation of nitrite, supplement with a biocide.</p>
<p>2. Molybdate-Caustic Soda.</p>
<p>a. Soften makeup water if hardness is over 250 ppm as CaCO3.</p>
<p>b. Maintain 100 to 125 ppm molybdate as MoO4.</p>
<p>c. Add sodium hydroxide to maintain a pH range of 8.0 to 9.0.</p>

DISCLAIMER

This Source Sought Notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this Notice that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this Notice.

Scope:  
A. Background
The Amarillo Veterans Affairs Health Care System (AVAHCS) Department of Pathology & Laboratory Service (P&LMS) and all Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC)  that perform testing on patients (human specimens) must subscribe to an external proficiency testing program as an enhancement to the internal quality control program that meets Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) 1988 and amendments to: 
a.	Ensure reliability of patient testing in the laboratory.
b.	Meet accreditation requirements.
c.	Must subscribe to external proficiency test (PT) programs for all analytes for which PT is available, including waived testing, provider performed microscopy, and unregulated analytes.
 AVAHCS P&LMS performs clinical diagnostic tests on patients (human specimens)  and in the event should any or all departments within the P&LMS should fail to meet the PT requirements as described in 42 CFR 493, Subpart H, or who have demonstrated deficiencies which pose a direct threat to patients may be instructed to terminate those particular diagnostic testing.
CAP has determined the analyte specific evaluation criteria and target values used to grade PT results for regulated analytes. CLIA categorization is determined after the FDA has cleared or approved a marketing submission.  The FDA determines the test's complexity by reviewing the package insert test instructions submitted by the manufacturer, and using a criteria "scorecard" to categorize a test as moderate or high complexity.
B. Scope
The overall purpose of this requirement is to obtain a contractor to provide a CLIA'88 approved proficiency testing program so that AVAHCS P&LMS and ancillary testing sites that perform patient testing are in compliance with the VHA Handbook 1106.01 proficiency testing requirements.
AVAHCS P&LMS and ancillary testing sites perform patient testing in the following CLIA specialties/subspecialties:   Arterial Blood Gases, General Immunology, Hematology, Routine Chemistry (serum and urine), and Urine Toxicology; as well as serum Alcohol, Ammonia, CRP, and Creatinine (eGFR) testing.
PT shall be performed in each department of the P&LMS and all ancillary testing sites that perform patient testing in accordance with calendar of events or shipping table provided by the vendor.  Each department/site must perform PT testing on every analyzer (including backup analyzers) for the primary test method for each test/assay performed on-site.
The PT program must be CLIA approved for all aforementioned CLIA specialties/subspecialties.
All pertinent proficiency testing information shall be internally managed via Microsoft database.

DESCRIPTION. The National Park Service, Olympic National Park (OLYM), has a requirement for removal of the restroom buildings, water stations, septic tanks and associated piping at Altair and Elwha campgrounds. At Altair campground work also includes the removal of asphalt paving.  The river has changed course and has severely eroded the bank dropping a good portion of the lower part of the campground into the river.  The park needs to be proactive and remove other items that could be in danger of collapsing into the river during storm events or high water.   The park has proposed a plan to retain the upper portion of the campground for use as a picnic area.  All objects in the lower terrace of the campground need to be removed.  At the Elwha campground the river flowed through the campground depositing over three feet of silt.  The park has removed the silt from around the restroom building.  Work includes one bid option to remove fire rings, food storage cabinets, and picnic tables in the Elwha campground. Unless specified to be salvaged, all demolished materials are to be removed from the park and disposed of or recycled at appropriate facilities. Olympic National Park encourages the contractor to recycle as many materials as is practical, such as asphalt paving, concrete, and metal roofing. Pressure wash and/or steam clean all construction equipment including hauling vehicles before entering Olympic National Park for the first time; subsequent entries will not require pressure washing unless the vehicle shows signs of mud, plant material, or other substances that could be considered harmful. Note: Removal and relocation of the concrete vault toilets are not part of this contract. SAFETY: Contractors are required to comply with all OSHA regulations and maintain a safe working environment.  Contractor will need to pay attention to weather and river conditions to safely accomplish the work. This description does not contain all of the information contained in the project Scope of Work. Offerors shall refer to Attachment no. 2, Scope of Work, as well as review the other four other attachments that comprise site plans and photographs, Attachments no. 3 through 7, all available in FedConnect. 

PERFORMANCE PERIOD and SITE ACCESS. The Olympic Hot Springs Road is currently closed to the public due to a washout.  Road repair is currently underway by OLYM¿s road crew, scheduled to be completed in September 2016, to be followed by a paving contract. The paving contract is soon to be awarded with an anticipated start date the third or fourth week of September 2016, which will fully re-open the once completed. Due to the dynamic nature of the Elwha River, the demolition work of this contract should start as soon as possible after the re-opening of the road, and preferably be completed by the end of October 2016.

ELWHA and ALTAIR CAMPGROUND LOCATIONS. There are no physical addresses for these two campgrounds. Both campgrounds are located off of Olympic Hot Springs Road within Olympic National Park. The turn-off from US Highway 101 onto Olympic Hot Springs Road is approximately 10 miles West of Port Angeles, WA. Once you turn off of Highway 101 onto Olympic Hot Springs Road, the Elwha Campground is approximately 3 miles up the road, and the Altair Campground is approximately 4.4 miles up the road (1.4 miles further up the road past the Elwha Campground). The Elwha Campground is on the left side, and the Altair Campground is on the right side. Olympic Hot Springs Road is currently closed to all public access because road repairs are underway, as explained above. 

QUOTES ARE DUE AT 4PM PACIFIC TIME (PT) ON FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2016.

Two of our current marking trailers are of aluminum construction with wood lining in the trailer walls and flooring.  In the extremely wet environment, both outside and inside the trailers, the wood has begun to rot.  This is the reason why no wood should be used on this new trailer. Deliverables:

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to a previous presolicitation notice is to post the following revisions and the below questions and answers.
The RFQ will be issued on or after September 6, 2016 on General Services Administration Schedule 70 SIN 132 -51 as a 100% Small Business set-aside.
This notice does not in itself represent the issuance of a formal request for proposal/quote and is not intended to be taken as such.
The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 541512. The estimated date of award for this action is September 27, 2016.   Questions/responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Contract Specialist, Keiahna Brewer, e-mail:  Keiahna.Brewer@va.gov, with the subject line as the synopsis number, VA118-15-R-1225.  The Points of Contact (POCs) for this action are Keiahna Brewer, Contract Specialist, 732-440-9686 or Robert Kately, Contracting Officer, 732-440-9681.
Posted Questions and Answers
1.	I noticed the NAICS code listed on the pre-solicitation is "519190 All Other Information Services."  Will this be the NAICS code for the final solicitation and, if so, will you be considering bidders with different NAICS codes as long as they meet the business size standards and can perform the work? 

The anticipated NAICS for the presolicitation has been changed to 541512.  Vendors will need to meet the NAICS and business size standards.
2.	1) The Scope of Work in the PWS states "The Entrust SM8 CA shall integrate with and be useable by the AI CMS for key history and recovery purposes during card issuance."  We assume that as long as the keys, and associated metadata, are stored in the correct format in Entrust that it will interoperate with the AI CMS.  I just want to confirm that integration of the Entrust server with the AI CMS is outside of the scope of this project.

Please note that there is not an "Entrust server" in the contract.  What is *in scope* for the contract is integration of the SM8 certificates (which is an Entrust solution) must function properly with the Card Management Server (CMS).  

3.	 Can the contractor request progress payments?  Can the contractor bill monthly?

The Government will not be accepting progress payments, as this is a firm fixed price contract.
