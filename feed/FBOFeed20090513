<DESC>The 554 ELSG Program Office is seeking information from industry regarding possible technical approaches to fulfill the AF/A1 community's requirement to automate the pre-board preparation and board promotion scoring process to include an ergonomic, multi-touch GUI with a peer presentation layer to review, score, enlarge, and display Air Force member records. The 554 ELSG Program Office is especially interested in creative suggestions, even if they involve radical changes to the current approach.  This RFI is in support of an AF/A1 transformation initiative to improve personnel processes and optimize personnel resources.  The purpose of this RFI is to determine the availability, feasibility and viability of existing technologies to meet the subjectInformation RequestThe 554 ELSG Program Office welcomes your comments on the requirement provided and associated activities; particularly on how to enhance and automate the current process by leveraging an existing system wherever possible and/ or developing a system that not only allows the Promotion Board (PB) members to perform their duties effectively, but also with an aesthetically pleasing and ergonomically correct environment. The Program Office  is especially interested in creative suggestions to the following questions, for strengthening over the long term any and all aspects of our system for identifying the most meritorious and innovative research for support:1.Challenges of eBOSS System RequirementPlease describe any specific challenges presented by the eBOSS concept/need statement such as any vague statements or inconsistencies that may eventually lead to changes in the technical approach.2.Solutions to ChallengesPlease concisely describe specific approaches or concepts that would address any of the above challenges, even if it involves a radical change to the current approach.3.Suggested Hardware and SoftwarePlease suggest the appropriate hardware or software needed to provide the multi-touch screen technology required for the Promotion Board Members.  Identify the most ergonomically correct and aesthetic solution as well as knowledge and experience configuring the software inherent to the display screen.4.Suggested interface solutionPlease suggest the appropriate method for acquiring data for use in the board room from all 14 systems identified as data providers. Please note some of the functions performed by the systems include the logic necessary to prepare for Promotion Boards. Also, please note the Force Development Execution Support System (FDESS) is currently in development and is expected to be released by 05 Jan 2010.5.Suggested Hardware and Software for the Integration LayerPlease suggest the HW & SW required to build the integration layer between the multi-touch display technology, the logic layer and the data.

<DESC>SynopsisThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of River Protection (ORP) planstocontract by means other than full and open competition.  DOE ORP plans toawarda sole source contract to California Institute of Technology (CIT)physicallylocated in Pasadena, CA 91125.  CIT will provide technical support andexpertise to DOE ORP Nuclear Safety Division (NSD) as it relates toHydrogen inPiping and Ancillary Vessels (HPAV) testing for a Quantitative RiskAssessmentfor the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP).As a result of implementing the recommendations of the HPAV Assessment TeamReport from February 26, 2009, DOE ORP Nuclear Safety Division requiresadditional HPAV testing for a Quantitative Risk Assessment in support oftheWaste Treatment Plant.  DOE ORP requires CIT to carry out a quantificationofminimum detonable geometries of gas pockets with realistic gas compositionsandthe effect of liquid waste on initiation of propaganda explosions using 2pipes and liquid mixtures indicative of the WTP waste.  CIT will alsoperformvisualization tests in a rectangular channel to determine the actualdispersionof the liquids simulating the WTP waste with high-speed video imaging,whichwill provide significant new data on flame and detonation propagation inpockets bounded by horizontal liquid layers.  CIT will work with BechtelNational, INC and subcontractors to provide information and editorialcommentsfor a review of the propagation above liquid levels.  They will alsoprovidemonthly project reports, a draft final report, and a final report of theirtestresults and recommendations.  CIT must be able to commence performance attheDOE ORP no later than June 1, 2009.  The estimated dollar value for thisprocurement is approximately $293K.The California Institute of Technology provided the original testing andrecommendations for the HPAV Assessment Team Report, which is the basis fortherequired Quantitative Risk Assessment for the WTP. Therefore, DOE ORP hasdetermined that this requirement can only be satisfied by the uniqueservicesthat are available from the CIT.The statutory authority permitting this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1),whichdetermines that only one responsible source exists and no other supplier orservices will satisfy agency requirements.This notice is not a request for proposals, and none will be accepted;however,DOE ORP will review any information submitted by interested parties todetermine if they could potentially fill similar requirements in thefuture.Any questions or comments regarding this action shall be e-mailed to RobynBurt, Contract Specialist, DOE Office of River Protection, Richland, WA99354,at robyn_l_burt@rl.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQ) for the F/A-18C/D Roadmap Procurement Program (RPP) with L-3 Communications Corporation, Link Simulation & Training Division (L-3), Arlington, TX under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". The anticipated ceiling amount for this contract is $250M with a base five year ordering period with three additional one year options if the ceiling has not been exhausted. The F/A-18C/D RPP IDIQ will provide for the acquisition, modification and upgrades of USN and USMC F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and for the modification and upgrade of F/A-18E/F and EA-18G Tactical Operational Flight Trainer (TOFT) hardware and software components that are common with F/A-18C/D TOFT components to maximize capabilities amongst platforms.  L-3 developed and built the existing twenty-six F/A-18C/D TOFT training systems and provided upgrades and modifications for Software Configuration Set (SCS) 19C and 20X, Navy Aviation Simulation Master Plan (NASMP) interoperability, Brief/Debrief Stations, Mission Operation Centers, image generators and visual databases.  The F/A-18C/D training systems requirements include incorporation of all ongoing aircraft engineering change proposals (ECPs), SCS updates, (to include, but not limited to 21X, 23X, 25X, 27X) and incorporation of major subsystems identified in the F/A-18C/D aircraft development roadmap that support training in the full mission spectrum from planning through mission rehearsal including individual through joint interoperability levels encompassing events in the initial strike fighter training syllabus, Strike Aircraft Training and Readiness (T&R)  Matrix, Air Combat Training Continuum (ACTC), and events associated with Inter-Deployment Readiness Cycle (IDRC).  Any new F/A-18C/D training systems, modifications and upgrades must be fully integrated and interoperable with the currently fielded F/A-18C/D systems and require the use of technical information that is not readily available to other contractors during design and development as the Government has neither the intellectual property rights nor data necessary to provide to another contractor.  The FA-18C/D RPP IDIQ will also focus on reducing cost of ownership by optimizing existing hardware and software commonality across all F/A-18 and EA-18G TOFTs through the extensive use of common interfaces, data structures, hardware and software constructs.  As a subcontractor, L-3 provided hardware and software components for the thirteen F/A-18E/F TOFTs and the three EA-18G TOFTs that are common with the F/A-18C/D TOFTs.  These components include, but are not limited to the Instructor Operator Station, Brief/Debrief Station, visual database, image generators, host computers and interoperability of these devices with each other.  Common TOFT component modifications and upgrades must be fully integrated and interoperable with the currently fielded systems and require the use of technical information that is not readily available to other contractors during design and development due to restricted rights and limited data rights. Because the contract requires in-depth knowledge of the current trainer design, award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling F/A-18 and EA-18G mission training requirements.  A competitive acquisition would allow for a new system to be introduced to the field that may not be integrated and interoperable with the existing systems due to the restricted rights and limited data rights that resulted from the original competitive award under the Training System Contract (TSC) II multiple award IDIQ at NAWCTSD.  This would require the Government to have two infrastructures in place for life cycle support or would require a significant rework of the current TOFT design and development that would cost the Government additional non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort for first article development, testing, and retrofit of existing TOFTs.  As the current sole designer, developer, integrator, manufacturer and supplier of USN and USMC F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and hardware and software components that are common to the F/A-18C/D, F/A-18E/F, and EA-18G TOFTs, only L-3 possesses the requisite knowledge, engineering expertise, and data rights of the design required to design, build, modify, upgrade and deliver F/A-18C/D aircrew training systems and to maximize the capabilities amongst the F/A-18 platforms to include F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G TOFT common component acquisitions, modifications and upgrades within the Governments requisite delivery schedule.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice that outlines the Governments intent to contract on a sole source basis with L-3.  However, interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. Interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, ability to obtain F/A-18 C/D technical data,  and any other information, that demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Holly DeFord (holly.deford@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than 1 June 2009. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No solicitation document is available. If no affirmative written response is received, the IDIQ Contract for the F/A-18C/D RPP will be awarded without further notice prior to award.

This procurement uses a single phase design-build selection procedure and consists of one solicitation with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to the responsible proposers whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the best value, price and other factors considered. Price evaluation preference will be given to HUBZone Small Business concerns, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4. This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task ord! ers to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, renovation, alteration, and repairs primarily by design-build or secondarily by fully designed wet utilities or related projects at various locations within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility including, but not limited to, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in Southern California. Types of projects may include, but are not limited to:  water, steam, sewer, and storm sewer lines; wells, mains, pumping stations, treatment plants, storage tanks and facilities and related work.  All structures (including buildings) that are integral parts of the water, steam, and sewer networks are included.  This contract will not include waterfront related construction or oil and gas pipeline construction.  The North American Industr! y Classification System (NAICS) code is 237110, and the annual size standard is $33.5 million. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $300,000,000. Task orders will range between $500,000 and $20,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. The Government intends to evaluate prop! osals and award contract(s) without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  Factor 1 - Experience of the Offeror and Offeror's Team, Factor 2 - Past Performance, Factor 3 - Management Plan; Factor 4 - Small Business Utilization, Factor 5 - Technical Approach, and Factor 6 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001). Source Selection procedures will be used, and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for Tuesday, June 09, 2009, at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) has a requirement for engineering testing and analysis services for the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) project for solids separation and concentration of shipboard wastewaters and residuals by a High Shear Rotary Membrane System (HSR-MS).  The procurement will have a period of performance from the effective date of the purchase order through 6 months thereafter.
The set-aside for small business concerns has been dissolved.  The NAICS code is 541330.  The proposed contract action is being solicited on a sole-source basis to University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) Civil and Environmental Engineering Department (CEE).  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). UMBC CEE research engineers and scientists have considerable experience with both HSR-MS and shipboard wastes.  They have been working on various HSR-MS and/or Navy waste solids issues for over four years and have developed initial advanced HSR-MS concepts that require further development, testing, and verification.  Award to any other source at this stage of the program would result in duplication of costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition and would result in an unacceptable time delay.

Interested offerors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a capability statement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received by 18 May 2009 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This notice serves as public announcement that the United States Postal Service (USPS) is seeking to pre-qualify sources for participation in future competitive acquisitions for selection of contractors to provide Freight Transportation Management Services (FTMS) for the Non-Mail Freight Transportation (NMFT) team.  The USPS intends to pre-qualify an adequate number of suppliers whose record of performance in the marketplace (commercial or governmental or both) have demonstrated their ability to consistently perform to high standards of quality and reliability.  Pre-qualification is the process of up-front identification of top-quality suppliers able to compete for specific types of contract opportunities.  Selection of the appropriate suppliers is critical to the USPS success. This augments the USPS ability to deliver high-quality and innovative services to its customers and reduces operational risks.  Pre-qualifying suppliers enhances competition, ensures quality performance, and can also shorten cycle time and strengthen relationships between the USPS and its suppliers.  The USPS extends an invitation to supplier with specific skills in Freight Transportation Management Services.  Suppliers having extensive experience in FTMS may submit documentation outlining the scope of work previously performed.  USPS will be completing the prequalification evaluation process to identify suppliers capable of completing the proposed service. 

The USPS transports freight to support postal operations which includes vehicles, mail processing equipment, supply items, parts, and end-of-use materials for investment recovery.  The NMFT utilizes FTMS to maintain a logistics network for the transportation of freight throughout the USPS network.  Freight transportation for the USPS is handled in a single decentralized manner but will be processed through a primary system.  Historically, the FTMS providers complete between 25,000 and 60,000 invoice transactions per year.  


The USPS is seeking an external FTMS contractor to provide the following services.

1.  Provide, maintain, improve and host an external software platform that records and validates shipment and freight invoice data

2.  Audit freight bills for accuracy and create an electronic payment file that is submitted to a designated Postal Accounting Operation for payment

3.  Arrange for Non-Mail Freight Transportation to meet the needs of USPS users and suppliers

4.  Assure USPS receives agreed to, or better shipping rates when available based on the efficiencies of scale from leveraged volumes as well as effectively matching carrier type with service requirements

5.  Exercise control, oversight and selection of Freight Transportation Providers for ongoing USPS Non-Mail Freight.  Monitor and manage carriers performance for improvement

6.  Proactively manage loss and damage resolutions of non-mail freight shipments

7.  Manage activities and achieve key performance indicators as established in the offerors proposal

8.  Review freight invoices for payment and resolve carrier payment discrepancies.  Perform pre-payment audits, provide reports electronically, and engage in frequent reviews with the NMFT

9.  Provider will be responsible for submitting a plan for phase in/phase out for implementation start-up and exit strategies for data integration, diminishing of shipments, and migration afterwards for electronic invoices.

10.  The contractor will be responsible for audit and certifications at the end of their period of performance.

For the purpose of this solicitation, the prequalification requirements include the following:
  
  The supplier must be a registered corporation in the United States of America.
  The supplier must have at least three years of freight transportation management services experience. 
  The supplier must provide an income statement and balance sheet for at least one year of service.
  The supplier is to provide the number of employees and office locations within the United States. 

All qualified suppliers may not be placed on the pre-qualified list if the purchase team determines, that a smaller group will provide adequate competition or, that some suppliers are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding purchase opportunities for the less qualified. It is the intent of USPS to use this pre-qualified suppliers list for future solicitations for certain Non-Mail Freight Transportation Services contracts over a 3-year period following the completion of this prequalification.
  
Suppliers that have not been pre-qualified will not receive the Request for Proposal. 

The USPS will evaluate a firms pre-qualification submission against each of the Prequalification Evaluation requirements listed above.  Pre-qualification responses will be due by 15:30 PM (EST) June 12, 2009. All questions and comments regarding any aspect of this notice must be sent via email to: CMC.Surfacetransportation@USPS.gov to the attention of: Linda Jordan by 6/12/2009, no later than 15:30 PM (EST). The email must not exceed 6 megabytes; otherwise send multiple emails and attachments.  Submissions may be mail to and must be received by COB on 6/12/2009:

Attn: Linda Jordan
P. O. Box 44374

Pre-qualification does not constitute a contract award.  All interested firms and incumbent suppliers who have previously been pre-qualified must submit a response to this notice in order to be considered for this prequalification opportunity. This announcement does not commit the USPS to the reimbursement of any proposal cost or expense, or otherwise create an obligation on the part of the USPS. The USPS is not obligated to award any contract as a result of this announcement.

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be posted within the next 60 days.

As part of an integrated strategy to provide veterans with timely access to quality health care services, VA healthcare facilities are authorized to pay for health care services acquired from non-VA health care providers. These services may be provided to eligible veterans from non-VA health care providers when VA determines medically necessary services are not available from VA on a timely basis, in an emergency or when VA or other Federal facilities are not feasibly available. VA manages the authorization, claims processing and reimbursement for services acquired from non-VA health care providers through the Purchased Care Program.  The basic provisions of and authority for the Purchased Care Program are provided through public laws passed by Congress.  These laws have been codified into the United States Code and further clarified in the Code of Federal Regulations.  Various VA policies and directives have been written to provide additional interpretation.VA seeks an interim system to improve Purchased Care claims management.

<DESC>The Air Force Special Operation Command (AFSOC) is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for a potential requirement for AFSOC/A7AV support for/at Hurlburt Field, FL, with an estimated one-year period of performance starting on or about September 2010. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 333618, small business size standard in number of employees is 1,000.  

Executive order 13423 mandates the Federal Government reduce energy consumption, increase the use of green products, reduce green house gases, and divert or reduce solid waste. The AFSOC/A7AV Transportable Plasma Waste to Energy System (TPWES), when complete, will convert unsorted municipal waste, medical waste, hazardous and non hazardous waste including used oil and off-spec fuel into a synthesis gas. The synthesis gas will then be converted to electricity using a commercially proven spark plug ignited GE Jenbacher gas engine.  The drawback of the TPWES operating using a gas engine is that it must be initially started up by pulling electricity either from an existing grid or from a stand-alone generator.  This requirement limits the deployability of the TPWES if an adequately-sized generator or grid is not available.  Dual fuel engines will transform the TPWES into a completely independent mobile unit, which can be deployed and operated at most locations, even those which have no access to the power grid. The TPWES would be started up using diesel or natural gas.  Once the plasma system starts to produce synthesis gas from garbage, it will be blended into the dual fuel engine to dramatically reduce or eliminate other fuel consumption (i.e., diesel, biodiesel or natural gas). 

Performance Requirements: The contractor would support the TPWES program by developing, modifying and testing the production of electrical power using dual fuel engines, (i.e. diesel/synthesis gas (syn gas)/natural gas motor generators).  The syn gas will be produced from organic waste using a Transportable Plasma Waste to Energy System (TPWES) located at Hurlburt Fld, Fl.  Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) engines, capable of working in a dual fuel mode with synthesis gas or with conventional fuels, shall be modified to minimize conventional fuel requirements; i.e., run on syn gas produced from garbage, thus reducing the logistic tail for fuels in deployed locations.  Various combinations will be tested to prove the concept and find the optimal syn gas fuel mix that operates reliably.  Petroleum-based diesel, natural gas and green fuels such as bio-diesel shall be tested in three phases. The Contractor would provide all personnel, supervision, equipment and other services necessary to perform the dual fuel testing as described below.  Personnel under this Performance Work Statement will not deploy.  

Performance Work Statement:

Phase 1) Convert a COTS diesel engine into a dual fuel engine: This task will develop special gas mixtures/gas trains to mix and introduce synthesis gas and combustion air into a standard diesel engine. In addition, modifications to the intake manifolds, ignition sequence, the control/governing logic, etc, shall be accomplished to optimize electricity output in dual fuel mode, while reducing diesel fuel requirements. 

Phase 2) Convert COTS natural gas engine into a dual fuel engine: This task will develop special gas mixtures/gas trains to mix and introduce the synthesis gas and combustion air into a standard natural gas engine. In addition, the task will modify the ignition sequence and the control/governing logic to produce electricity in dual fuel mode. The engine parameters will be fine tuned to maximize replacement of the natural gas with the synthesis gas once the TPWES is operating at full capacity. 

Phase 3) Using bio-diesel in dual fuel mode: This task will be a follow on effort to Phase 1 in which the engine parameters will be further developed in an effort to replace standard fossil fuel diesel with bio-diesel produced by green technologies. 

Summary: It is anticipated that this procurement will be issued under the Foreign Comparative Testing program, and the purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to locate whether there are domestic companies capable of performing.  

This Sources Sought Synopsis is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.

No contract award will be made on the basis of this SSS, and no funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this SSS, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information. Any information provided in response to this market research will be used for informational purposes only and will not be returned. All proprietary information should be clearly marked as such. All information submitted by respondents to this SSS, including appropriately marked proprietary information, will be safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure.

Firms responding to this announcement should include company name, cage code, point of contact, address and indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or small disadvantaged business. Potential offerors should submit a 1 page report with the offeror's relevant experience and capabilities in modifying COTS engines to accept syngas and test the results, i.e. durability, diesel fuel savings, maintenance implications, etc.  The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.

DESCRIPTION

The NLRB will provide technical direction to the clerical assistants and a monthly report of performance.  Direct supervision will be handled by the service providers point of contact (PoC).

In addition, the clerical assistants may also be responsible for filing documents, operating a duplicating machine, answering telephones, opening mail and drafting letters using Microsoft Word.  Additionally, the clerical assistants will be required to lift boxes weighing 10-20 pounds. 

Due to the repetitive nature of the work, it is recommended, but not required, that one full-time position or (FTE) equivalent be shared among 3-5 school students to total a 40 hour work week for the period specified.  The service provider must have a team member available to perform the tasks between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday except where there is a Federal holiday or Federal excused time off.

<DESC>The Voluntary Safety Programs (VSP) Branch, AFS-230, is located at Dulles Airport. The contractor must provide AFS-230 with essential business process support for the Voluntary Disclosure Program (VDRP) and related Voluntary Safety Programs.  It also provides maintenance and development of associated automated systems.  Secondarily, it would provide business process support as required for FAA-internal management of related voluntary programs managed by AFS-230.  VDRP provides certificate holders, indirect air carriers, and production approval holders an avenue for avoiding civil penalties by disclosing safety issues to the FAA and taking corrective action to address those concerns.  The FAA believes that aviation safety is well served by providing incentives for organizations to identify and correct their own instances of regulatory noncompliance and to invest more resources in efforts to preclude their recurrence.  The FAA's policy of foregoing civil penalty actions when one of these entities detects violations, promptly discloses the violations to the FAA, and takes prompt action to ensure that the same or similar violations do not recur is designed to encourage compliance with the FAA's regulations, foster safe operating practices, and promote the development of internal evaluation programs.

FIRE (HEAT AND SMOKE) DETECTION SYSTEM FOR ACTIVATION OF SPRINKLING OR FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEM, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) Issue Date: 13 May 2009 - Closing Date: 05 June 2009.
"This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPS) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.  While it is understood that FEDBIZOPS is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FEDBIZOPS is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Carderock Division." 
Request for Information: This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The purpose of this RFI is to determine capability and to assess the experience of the current industry to meet the objectives stated below.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
Objective: Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD)/ Ships Systems Engineering Station (SSES), Philadelphia, has an interest in obtaining information about fire detection systems for shipboard applications that would activate sprinkling or fire suppression systems.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential suppliers.   The system shall consist of individually addressable, electronic, spot type, restorable, fixed temperature heat detectors; an air aspirated smoke detection system, a fire alarm control panel, and isolators or detector bases for the heat detectors which contain isolators.  The fire detection system equipment shall be listed or approved by a national or international standards organization or be approved by the Naval Technical Authority.  The system shall be capable of detecting and reporting the existence of fire threats, automatically activating a third-party sprinkling or fire suppression system, and reporting status signals (e.g., alarm, trouble and supervisory signals) to the ship's remote alarm notification system.  The air aspirated smoke detection system (which shall only provide early warning alarm indications and not actuate the sprinkling or fire suppression system) shall interface with the fire alarm control panel.  The spot type heat detectors shall provide alarm ! indications and shall automatically activate the sprinkling or fire suppression system.  The primary source of power for the fire alarm control panel shall be 120 VAC shipboard power in accordance with MIL-STD-1399.  A secondary power supply (e.g., back up batteries) shall be included which has sufficient capacity to operate the system under quiescent load (system operating in a non alarm condition) for a minimum of 24 hours.  The fire alarm control panel shall contain any transformers required to provide the power necessary for the air aspirated smoke detection system and the heat detectors.  Relays to activate the sprinkling or fire suppression system shall also be contained within the fire alarm control panel. The fire alarm control panel and the air aspirated smoke detection system shall interface (i.e., be integrated together).  The system shall be capable of displaying locally all sensor alarm, trouble and supervisory signals and analog temperature measurement informa! tion to an integrated LCD display.  The overall system shall be a Class A Signaling Line Circuit (SLC) type system in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) National Fire Alarm Code NFPA 72 and be survivable in the event of open, shorted, or grounded sensor cabling.  The isolators or heat detector bases which contain isolators shall be installed on the heat detector sensor loops to protect detectors from short circuits on other sections of the detector cabling.  The system shall have the software capability of easily adjusting or switching alarm thresholds (but only with password or other security protection) for the air aspirated smoke detection system and the heat detectors and automatically logging all alarm and trouble events.       
Additional information is also sought, if known, concerning the system's resistance to shipboard environmental requirements (beyond commercial specifications), such as MIL-S-901D shock (Grade A, Class 1, Type A, hull mounted), MIL-STD-167-1 or MIL-STD-167-1A vibration (Type 1, exploratory, variable frequency, and endurance), MIL-STD-461F Electromagnetic Interference  (CE101, CE102, CS101, CS106, CS114, CS116, RE101, RE102, RS101, RS103 (25 V/m)), and the overall system's resistance to higher than normal temperatures (e.g., 150  degrees Fahrenheit or above).  Information is also sought on real time measurement capabilities of the spot type heat detectors.  Specifically, is the system capable of displaying actual real time temperature measurements for each heat sensor (i.e., not solely their alarm threshold temperatures) and, if yes, what range of temperatures is capable of being measured/displayed? 
RFI Content: Written response to this RFI shall be limited to 35 pages, 12 font with single spacing (Additional test reports, if available, that specifically describe/document  the system's successful resistance to shock, vibration, EMI, and/or high temperature are not subject to this limitation).  If material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  Response should include, but is not limited to, a Company History.  A one page history should include: Small Business Administration (SBA) business size classification, major products, and primary customer base.  Additional technical or other information that the company deems necessary to aid the Government in making an informed assessment should also be included (such as system and component data sheets, pricing information, lists of existing shipboard users of the system, etc.).  
Submission Information: RFI responses shall be submitted no later than 05 June 2009 to: NSWCCD/SSES Philadelphia, 5001 S. Broad Street, Philadelphia, Pa 19112, Attn: Mr. Al Peters, Code 668.  Electronic responses are preferred and should be submitted to alfred.peters@navy.mil, with the email subject line reading, "FEDBIZOPS Fire Detection/Actuation System submission."  
Additional Information: Any information provided shall be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.  All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government.  NSWCCD may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.  At no cost to the Government, the government may request further clarification of a contractor's submission.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by industry responses to this RFI.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website located at http://www.fbo.gov/.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil   65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>The TRICARE Southeast (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4) and Central (TRBO Reg. 6, 7, & 8) Regions, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming, Texas, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico in the Regions including institutional and operational healthcare settings  announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of EXAM ROOM SUPPLIES. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the Southeast and Central regions based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in this LSA initiative include: Southeast Region -  Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Commuity Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS), the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  Central Region  Brooke Army Medical Center, FT Sam Houston TX., Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, FT Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK., William Beaumont Army Medical Center, FT Bliss, TX., 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO., Evans ACH Fort Carson CO., FT General Leonard Wood ACH, MO., FT Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV., and Bayne-Jones ACH, FT Polk, LA.  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil/.<BR><BR>The Southeast Region has been designated as the Lead TRBO for this standardization action.  The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is July 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Southeast and Central regions, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR>Point of Contact: Virginia Slayton, (706) 787-2019, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil. <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Southeast and Central Region are seeking product line items in the category of EXAM ROOM SUPPLIES, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below in Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Within the Southeast and Central regions, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $107,156.51.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast and Central regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Virginia Slayton, (706)787-2019, virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EDT on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Southeast region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Southeast Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EDT on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Lead TRBO Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Southeast and Central Regions Tri-Service Product Review Boards (TPRB) are the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast and Central region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Southeast and Central Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast and Central region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Southeast and Central region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Southeast and Central region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Southeast and Central region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to Virginia.Slayton@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified / invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor. <BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:   <BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Exam Room Supplies.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.<BR>a.	At a minimum the vendor must provide the following in the Exam Room Supplies: Multi-purpose applicators (Cotton & Rayon)  Latex Free/Safe, Low Lint; Sterile & Non-sterile, wrapped / bulk, available in a variety of sizes and types (3 to 6 inch, to include specialty applicators - OBGYN, Proto up to 16 inch), and plastic, wood, & polypropylene shafts; Tongue Depressors  Latex Free/Safe, Sterile & Non-Sterile, Smooth finish, splinter-free, with lengths beginning at 5  or 6 inches and above; Cotton Balls  Latex Free/Safe, Medium and Large prepping; sterile/non-sterile, and high absorbency.  <BR>b.

Vendor MUST provide prime vendor conversion number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Southeast Region PV (Owens & Minor) will be disqualified in Phase I.)  <BR>4.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor in the Central Region for Exam Room Supplies (currently, the prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare).  Vendor MUST provide prime vendor conversion number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Central Region PV (Cardinal Healthcare) will be disqualified in Phase I.)  <BR>5.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>6.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Exam Room Supplies products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the Lead TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to a representative from the Southeast and Central Region TRBO office and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the Medical Treatment Facilities by COB, 5:00 PM EDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the Lead TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  <BR>2.	Vendor product samples should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products requested.<BR>3.	When requested sample products are to be shipped directly to the Southeast and Central Region TRBO point of contact.<BR>4.	The TRBO point of contact is responsible for delivery of the sample sets to the participating MTFs prior to the evaluation and within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the sample sets.   <BR>5.	Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.    <BR>6.	Vendors WILL NOT be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products OR THEIR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS.<BR>7.	Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  Vendors that bring in other product samples or literature on items that are not part of the evaluation process will be disqualified from the evaluation process.<BR>8.	Vendors WILL NOT be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or pricerelated factors.  Vendors that speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluation; pricing or pricerelated factor will be disqualified from this evaluation process.  Vendors will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).<BR>9.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting using a Likert scale.  A one to five scoring range will be used to rate the sample products.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>10.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for one (1) calendar day.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).<BR>11.	To determine acceptability, the Clinical Product Team (CPT), comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast and Central Regions will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting.  Each criterion for Exam Room Supplies will be evaluated by two (2) trials.  <BR><BR>The following Clinical /Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>Applicators ONLY<BR>1.	(National Patient Safety Goal # 7  (NPSG.07.02.01, and NPSG.07.03.01)  Specifically Reduce the risk of healthcare associated infections by standardizing on products that place emphasis on preventing patient cross contamination)  The applicator is highly absorbent.<BR>a.	Applicators must be of sufficient absorbency (strength).  The inability to absorb may increase the risk of cross contamination and increased Healthcare-Associated Infections if the product cannot perform.  <BR>b.	With the applicator between the evaluators thumb and finger tip, the evaluator will observe the effectiveness of the absorbency while swabbing a lightly moist surface.   <BR>2.	(National Patient Safety Goal # 7  (NPSG.07.02.01, and NPSG.07.03.01)  Specifically Reduce the risk of healthcare associated infections by standardizing on products that place emphasis on preventing patient cross contamination)  The applicator tip maintains its form during use.<BR>a.	Applicator tip must remain consistently formed during usage without falling apart as this may increase the risk of cross contamination and increased Healthcare-Associated Infections.  <BR>b.	With the applicator between the evaluators thumb and finger tip, the evaluator will observe the quality of the applicator tip and then during usage observe the ability to maintain shape while swabbing a lightly moist surface.   <BR>3.	(National Patient Safety Goal # 7  (NPSG.07.02.01, and NPSG.07.03.01)  Specifically Reduce the risk of healthcare associated infections by standardizing on products that place emphasis on preventing patient cross contamination)  The applicator peel pack can be opened without the applicators sticking to the sterile packaging to ensure lint-free use. <BR>a.	The applicator packs must be able to open easily while maintaining sterility in order to decrease the potential for Healthcare-Associated Infections due to tearing of the pack or the applicator tip adhering to the package and lint breaking off.  <BR>b.	With the applicator package opening top in both hands, the evaluator will peel apart the pack; observe the pack opening and the ease to which the sterile applicator pack opens. <BR>Tongue Depressors ONLY<BR>4.	(National Patient Safety Goal # 7  (NPSG.07.02.01, and NPSG.07.03.01)  Specifically Reduce the risk of healthcare associated infections by standardizing on products that place emphasis on preventing patient cross contamination)  The tongue depressor peel packs can be opened without the depressor sticking to the sterile packaging to ensure its sterility.   <BR>a.	The tongue depressors must be able to open easily while maintaining sterility in order to decrease the potential for Healthcare-Associated Infections due to tearing of the pack.    <BR>b.	With the tongue depressor package opening top in both hands, the evaluator will peel apart the peel pack; observe the pack opening and the ease to which the peel pack opens. <BR>5.	(National Patient Safety Goal # 7  (NPSG.07.02.01, and NPSG.07.03.01)  Specifically Reduce the risk of healthcare associated infections on by standardizing on products that place emphasis on preventing patient cross contamination)  The tongue depressor is smooth and splinter-free. <BR>a.	The tongue depressors must be smooth and splinter free in order to decrease the potential for splinters to occur and thus increasing the potential for Healthcare-Associated Infections.    <BR>b.	With the tongue depressor in the evaluator hand, the evaluator will look closely at the tongue blade on each side then run it across the inside of the forearm and observe/feel for splinters that come off the depressor.   <BR> <BR>Pricing Analysis Process:  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast and Central Region combined.  Pricing must be received at the Lead TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EDT), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  The Southeast and Central region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast and Central Region). <BR><BR>The Southeast and Central Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Southeast and Central region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Southeast and Central region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis and are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Southeast and Central regions, (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, This is included as a reporting Matrix. (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor. Operational Impact of RIA prices on the Regions are considered more important than other pricing elements. THE CLOSING DATE IS 04 JUNE 2009 5:00 PM EDT.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences intend to award a sole source, one year firm fixed price contract, in accordance FAR Part 12- Acquisition of Commercial Items to the University of California, 1001 Potrero, San Francisco, CA 94103. The University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) has the only yeast library for botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). No other antibodies have been able to give the same quality of results as UCSF. CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are classified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as one of the 6 highest-risk threat agents for bioterrorism (the "Category A agents"), due to their extreme potency and lethality, ease of production and transport, and need for prolonged intensive care. BoNTs have been produced and weaponized by rogue nations and deployed by terrorist groups. BoNTs can intoxicate via the aerosol or oral route and are the most poisonous substances known; a human oral LD50 being approximately 50 ug. As a result of this potency, sensitive assays are needed. Assays would be used both to screen for and detect the presence of BoNT in high volume food products, such as milk and other beverages, as well as for rapid and sensitive diagnosis from the serum of intoxicated individuals. Such assays must be: 1) very sensitive; 2) detect active BoNT; and 3) be able to function in complex sample mixtures such as milk and serum. The CDC has developed a sensitive mass spectrometry assay that detects BoNT cleavage of synthetic toxin substrates. For this assay to work in complex mixtures, a sample preparation step is required which consists of using an antibody to capture the toxin. This is an absolute requirement for the assay to function.</p>
<p>UCSF has been generating high affinity monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the botulinum neurotoxins. For this proposed work to continue, the collaboration with CDC will: 1) generate and evaluate mAbs for mass spectrometry based detection of the remaining BoNT serotypes including BoNT/D and BoNT/C-D mosaics and BoNT/G; 2) provide adequate quantities (100 mg/year) of each of the reference antibodies for the seven BoNT serotypes to allow adequate quantities of antibody for diagnostic testing; 3) generate and provide stable cell lines expressing each of the seven reference antibodies to the CDC to enable antibody production going forward; and 4) generate ricin binding IgG which can be used for sensitive detection of ricin by mss spectrometry.</p>
<p>CDC believes that UCSF is the only source available to provide this product that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurment based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 611310.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Thaddeus Rollins via email to tnr6@cdc.gov using the reference number 2009-Q-11261 in the subject line, no later than 5:00 pm Eastern Time, 29 May 2009.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences intend to award a sole source, one year firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items, to John Hopkins University, 1100 John Hopkins Road, Laurel, MD 20723. John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHUAPL) is the single source congruent for conversion of PAH diolepoxide standards to PAH tetrol standards. JHUAPL is the only established laboratory converting PAH diolepoxides in the CDC inventory to the corresponding isomeric tetrols that satisfied project requirements for isomer purity, characterization and delivery capability. CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>The native standards for extending the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon hemoglobin/serum adducts (PAHHA) analyte biomarker domain from tetrols of a single PAH to multiple analytes quantitatively referenced to isotopically labeled carbon-13 PAH tetrol isomer labeled standards. This domain extension is accomplished by obtaining native polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) reference standards for isomeric tetrols (the PAH metabolites resulting from hydrolysis of protein adducts) for the PAHHA Project. Isotope dilution gas chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry methods for determination of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) exposure in human hemoglobin and albumin have been developed in our laboratory and applied to BaP tetrol isomer studies in small local populations and in exposed populations in China and Poland. BaP is a model biomarker for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure, and PAH exposure has been correlated with cancer. JHUAPL has been the first to report individual BaP tetrol isomer levels as well as isomer totals, investigators reporting PAH exposure from DNA adducts have reported human exposure for up to 10 parent PAHs. An extended analyte group from conversion of native PAH diolepoxide standards in the PAHHA Laboratory inventory would delineate a more representative profile for PAH exposure and would be consistent with the DLS mission of operating on the cutting edge of emerging trajectories in human exposure quantitative determinations. Preliminary results in international laboratories and in our laboratory indicate human exposure PAH multi-analyte determinations are possible for DNA, hemoglobin and serum adducts.</p>
<p>The scope of work involves custom conversion of precursor isomeric PAH diolepoxides to corresponding PAH tetrol isomers, followed by purification and unambiguous structural characterization of each native tetrol isomer. High native isomer standard integrity is imperative. Establishing new methods for quantitative determination of multi-analyte PAH adducts in humans for hemoglobin and albumin adducts and incorporating additional PAH tetrol standards extends the profiles of human exposure to PAHs and develops a more definitive capability beyond limited hemoglobin and albumin adduct analytes currently reported in the literature. Successful development and implementation from addition of the converted PAH tetrol standards would result in an enhanced profile of human exposure results that report individual PAH tetrol isomers (individual isomers not currently reported) from an emerging array of PAHs of variable structure and reactivity. This array includes reactive PAHs such as 5-methylchrysene, benzo[g] chysene, 7,12-dimethylchrysene and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene that have not been reported in human exposure studies. The extended method would result in a new capability not currently reported by other laboratories and could provide a wealth of new information in reference range and human exposure studies and additional insights into adverse human health effects (cancer, pulmonary, coronary, etc... ) resulting from exposure to PAHs.</p>
<p>CDC believes that JHUAPL is the only source available to provide this product that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not request for proposal.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences intend to award a sole source, one year firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items, to Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (CIL), 50 Frontage Rd, Andover, MA 01810. CIL is the only commercial supplier for isotopically labeled carbon- 13 tetrols with the capability for PAH tetrol isomer synthesis in a short time frame. CIL has established a singular track record for synthesis, characterization and delivery of high purity isotopically labeled isomers as internal standards for human exposure in CDC laboratories. CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>The proposed acquisition provides carbon-13 isotopically labeled polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) internal standards for isomeric tetrols (the PAH metabolites resulting from hydrolysis of protein adducts) of anti-5-methylchrysene diolepoxide, anti-dibenzo[a,l]pyrene dioleoxide and benzo[a]pyrene. The new internal standards, appearing near the beginning of the chromatographic separation window for PAH tetrols and at the end of the chromatographic separation, respectively, would provide a more accurate quantitative determination of multi-analyte PAH levels in humans - extending the PAH hemoglobin/serum adducts (PAHHA) analyte biomarker domain from tetrols of a single PAH to multiple analytes quantitatively referenced to the new labeled standards and the four carbon-13 BaP tetrol isomer labeled standards that appear in the middle of the chromatographic window. Isotope dilution gas chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry methods for determination of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) exposure in human hemoglobin and albumin have been developed in our laboratory and applied to BaP tetrol isomer studies in small local populations and in exposed populations in China and Poland. BaP is a model biomarker for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure, and PAH exposure has been correlated with cancer.

An extended analyte group would delineate a more representative profile for PAH exposure and would advance the DLS mission of operating on the cutting edge of emerging trajectories in PAH human exposure quantitative determinations. 5-methylchrysene and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene are highly reactive PAHs that adversely affect human health and have been recently reported in air samples and food products. Preliminary results in our laboratory indicate human exposure multi-analyte determinations are possible for hemoglobin and serum adducts.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY The General Services Administration intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Smith Group in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to update the existing stamped drawings and specifications they previously developed for the replacement of windows at the John F Kennedy Federal Building in Boston, MA. The work was performed under contract  GS-11-98MYD9912 which was awarded on  a competitive basis.  The work to be performed includes updating the  plans and specifications previously delivered by the Smith Group for code compliance of insulation systems and replacing courtyard curtain wall systems and tower building window systems,  post construction contract services and limited management and inspection services.   Smith Group has the staff with historical background knowledge needed to expedite the JFK window project by updating their previous design.  The plans and specifications to be developed by Smith Group will be used for a competitive construction contract which the Government expects to award on or before August 1, 2009  for the window replacement project.   The anticipated award date of the design contract is May 29, 2009.  While Smith Group is the only known source capable of meeting this requirement, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement that demonstrates their firms ability to update the existing stamped plans and specifications, accept design liability for those plans and specifications and complete the updating of the construction documents no later than 30 days prior to the construction award date stated above.  Interested parties may submit rationale as to why they should be considered within seven (7) days of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to proceed with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statement and documentation by e-mail to kimberly.yates@gsa.gov or by mail to GSA, Property Development Division, 10 Causeway Street, Room 975, Boston, MA  02222.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is AG-7MN1-S-09-0006 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The NAICS is 444220, business size is $6.5 million.  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31.

The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Kika de la Garza Subtropical Agricultural Research Laboratory, Weslaco, Texas has a need for Nursery grown Arunda donax plants.  The laboratory requires 15,600 plants to be delivered 1200 per week over a 13 week period.  The following will detail the specific requirements.  Arundo donax L., giant reed is an exotic and invasive weed of riparian habitats and irrigation canals of the Rio Grande River Basin and the southwestern U.S.  Arundo dominates these habitats, which leads to: loss of biodiversity; catastrophic stream bank erosion; damage to bridges; increased costs for chemical and mechanical control along transportation corridors, and impedes law enforcement activities on the international border. Additionally, this invasive weed competes for water resources in an arid region where these resources are critical to the environment, agriculture and municipal users.  Biological control using insects from the native range of Arundo may be the best option for long-term management of this weed. Arundo donax is a good target for biological control because it has no close relatives in North or South America, and several of the plant-feeding insects from its native range in Mediterranean Europe are known to be specialists feeding only on this one plant species.  USDA-ARS has an on-going biological control program for Arundo.  Additional plant production of Arundo is needed for use in the insect mass-rearing program.  1) Contractor will grow Arundo donax plants in 3 gallon plants.  2) Contractor will provide 2 weekly deliveries (every Monday and Thursday) of 600ea for a total of 1200 per week, 3 gallon pots of Arundo donax plants.  3) Contractor will deliver healthy Arundo donax plants with shoots between 1 and 2 feet tall, no shorter or taller.  4) Contractor must obtain prior approval from USDA, ARS to apply any insecticides to plants. (NO insecticide use without prior approval).  5) Arundo donax plants must be grown from Arundo donax rhizomes (4-8 inches long) that are mechanically field harvested by the Contractor from the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas.  6) Plants must be grown in an enclosed and heated greenhouse that will not have any insecticide use on other crops.  Greenhouses must be capable of maintaining a minimum average temperature of 80 degrees F during winter.  7) Plants must be grown from rhizomes that are no older than 1 month from field harvest.  8) Contractor will deliver plants to greenhouse facilities at USDA, APHIS, Moore Airbase, 22675 N. Moorefield Rd., Edinburg, TX 78541.  9) USDA reserves the right to cancel the contract with 30 days of prior notice. 10) Period of the performance is 13 weeks beginning July 6, 2009.

<DESC>The contractor shall provide a storage facility, approximately 10 acres in size, with appropriate fencing to ensure segregation of the Government material stored at the location. The contractor shall provide security as required to prevent unauthorized access to the material. When required, the contractor shall provide scheduling support to schedule material pickups in accordance with the statement of work (SOW) and shall load the scheduled material as required to support that schedule. The contractor shall provide reports as specified in the SOW and participate in meetings as required. The contractor shall manage the storage and inventory of this material and provide scheduling for material pickups and loading of flatbed trucks with the subject material.  The contract shall support loading up to 40 trucks a day with 7 days or less notice.  The contractor shall load, document (photograph load, prepare Bill of Lading [BOL] and DD-1149) and release trucks within 30 minutes.  The contractor shall schedule and confirm truck appointments within 48 hours and support emergency truck pickups with less that 24 hours notice.  The contract shall maintain the steel inventory with a proven commercial solution or successfully pass Defense Contract Management Agency audit.  The contractor shall perform regular cycle counts and maintain bundle traceability to heat/lot. The contractor shall provide electronic copies of all BOL and DD-1149 on a monthly basis and provide shipping reports the day after shipments are made.  A Firm Fixed Price Contract is anticipated with a monthly cost for material storage and inventory maintenance and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity clins for material pick ups based on 10 or 20 truck loads per day.  The duration of the contract period will be 07/01/2009 to 06/30/2010 with two one year options.  The place of contract performance is El Paso, TX   The Government intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to AMI Metals, Inc.  The reason this award will not be competed is based primarily on the foreseeable cost of transporting the steel from its current location in El Paso, TX to another location within a one hour drive of the current site.  The Government has estimated that it will cost between $865,000 and $1,008,000 to transport 26, 000 tons of steel to a new location and those costs would not be recovered through a competitive acquisition.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by SBI AO.

Proposals will be reviewed to determine which one represents the greatest value, price and other factors considered.  Award will not necessarily be made to the lowest priced offeror, but rather the one that offers the best value to the National Park Service in terms of the following evaluation criteria.  
Evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance.    1. Past Performance - Weight = 40 points	
Evaluation will be performed only for existing and prior contracts for work similar in nature and complexity to that required by the solicitation and will include the following:
A. Quality of Products and Services.  Demonstrated ability to fabricate visitor information signs (signs relating to pedestrian wayfinding, park regulations and safety, interpretation, resource protection and general information signs), wayside exhibit bases and hardware in accordance with required specifications. Conformance to good standards of workmanship and quality control. (0-10)
B. Customer Satisfaction.  Satisfaction of end users with the completed visitor information signs (signs relating to pedestrian wayfinding, park regulations and safety, interpretation, resource protection and general information signs), wayside exhibit bases and hardware. (0-10)
C. Timeliness of Performance.  Compliance with delivery schedules; reliability; and responsiveness to technical direction. (0-10)
D. Business Relations.  Effective management, ability to manage projects involving subcontracts, working relationship with the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Representatives, reasonable/cooperative behavior, flexibility, effective contractor recommended solutions, businesslike concern for government interests, and provides current, accurate, and complete billings. (0-10)
In the case of an offeror with respect to which there is no information on past contract performance, or with respect to which information on past contract performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past contract performance. In other words, past performance will be treated as neutral. This will be accomplished by giving a new firm the average score of the other competing offeror's and evaluating the proposal in accordance with the other stated evaluation criteria, (FAR 15.608(2)(iii)).
2. Comprehensive Plan including Quality Control - Weight = 30
Evaluation will be based on the adequacy and feasibility of the Comprehensive Plan including Quality Control.  Special emphasis will be placed on the Project Manager and how well the technical and management approaches will ensure the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of finished products.
3. Samples of Work - Weight = 20
Evaluation will be based on samples of work that demonstrate the ability of proposed personnel and subcontractors to manage and produce visitor information signs (signs relating to pedestrian wayfinding, park regulations and safety, interpretation, resource protection and general information signs), wayside exhibit bases and hardware that are similar in design and function to the requirements specified in the contract.
4. Personnel - Weight = 10
Evaluation will be based on the qualifications, education, knowledge, and work experience of all personnel, including subcontractors, proposed for use under the contract.  Special emphasis will be placed on personnel's training and/or experience in the fabrication of visitor information signs (signs relating to pedestrian wayfinding, park regulations and safety, interpretation, resource protection and general information signs), wayside exhibit bases and hardware as required by the contract.
Award Criteria:	
The government anticipates award of up to five firm-fixed-price IDIQ contracts resulting from this Request for Proposal.  Contract(s) will be made to those responsible offerors whose offer(s), conforming to the Request for Proposal will be most advantageous to the government, cost or price and other factors considered. Technical quality, including past performance, will be considered more important than cost or price. Warranty information, as well as life cycle cost considerations, will be included in the best value determination.  
Prices proposed will be examined to establish price reasonableness. 
While price will be a factor in the award decision, the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest unit prices and loaded labor rates. Likewise, award will not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. A thorough examination will be made to determine an offeror's adequate understanding of the Scope of Work related to proposal presentation, price (including materials) and other factors considered. The question to be decided in making the final selection will be whether proposals scoring better are worth the dollar difference (if any).
As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important. As the technical merit and the evaluated cost or price become essentially equal, other factors may become the determining factor.
The government will consider other factors, as listed below in descending order of importance, secondary to technical, geographical disbursement, and cost or price;
(1) HubZone small business concerns;(2) Small business concerns which are also minority owned and operated; (3) Women-owned firms; and(4) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms.
In addition to the evaluation of technical merit, the cost, or price, and other factors, the standards for determining an offeror's responsibility as set forth in FAR 9.104-1, will be examined and considered. Additional factors which are not specifically set forth in this solicitation, but which are prerequisites for award as implied by law, regulation or public policy will be considered in the determination of an offeror's acceptability.
Attachment I, Intention to Propose, should be submitted on or before June 5, 2009.  Technical proposals should be submitted in an original and four copies and business proposals should be submitted in an original and one copy for receipt no later than 4:00 p.m., EST, June 12, 2009, and shall be clearly marked with Request for Proposal Number N1141090036.  Offerors are hereby notified that if your proposal is not received by the date and time and at the location specified in this announcement that it will be considered late in accordance with FAR Part 52.212.1(f).  
Technical and business proposals should be sent to the National Park Service; Harpers Ferry Center; Office of Acquisition Management; Attention: Melody Wolfe, Contract Specialist; Request for Proposal Number N1141090036; P.O. Box 50; Harpers Ferry, West Virginia 25425-0050.  Proposals by telephone transmitted facsimile (fax) or electronic mail will not be accepted.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) (N55236-09-Q-8042) is issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 336611. The small business standard is 1000 employees. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-30 (Effective on March 31, 2009). DESCRIPTION: The requirement is for a firm-fixed-price (FFP) type purchase order; Contract Line Item No. (CLIN) 0001 is to provide Naval Port Operations Utility Boat refurbishment for one ACB-4, 26 ft Aluminum Chamber Boat (26UB0403); CLIN 0002: refurbish one OR-7, 26 ft A! lnor Boat (26UB0501); CLIN 0003: refurbish one NW-2, Northwinds Boat (24UB0402); CLIN 0004: refurbish one SCI-10, Northwinds Boat (24UB0401). Period of performance: 06/11/2009 through 08/28/2009. Refer to Attachment (1) for the entire statement of work. Work to be accomplished at contractor's facility. Offeror shall provide the facility name, street address, city, state, and zip code where the work is to be accomplished, with their quote. PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Packaging and preservation shall be performed in accordance with the best commercial practices to afford maximum protection against damage. DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: Items shall be priced at F.O.B. Destination and shall be delivered in accordance with the attached statement of work. Offerors shall include in their quote the cost of transportation of the boats. Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination by the Government. 52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract!  resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) past performance and (ii) price. Past performance when compared to price is approximately equal in importance. (b) Options (not applicable). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The total evaluated price will be the sum of CLINs 0001-0004. The Government will evaluate the proposed price for reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.305 (a)(1) and FAR Subpart 15.4. The Government wil! l also determine the realism and balance of each price by comparing it to other proposed prices and the independent government estimate. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror has satisfied customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Offeror's past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the following subfactors (of past performance) which are of equal importance: 1. Technical (Quality of Product) - expected performance of the technical requirements of the subject availability based upon an offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 2. Schedule - expected performance in meeting the schedule requirements of the subject availability based upon a offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness if any implemented or proposed corrective actions. 3. Management - the ex! pected performance in managing the subject availability based upon an offeror's past performance of previously awarded relevant contracts and the effectiveness of any implemented or proposed corrective actions. This includes an evaluation of the offeror's past performance in complying with the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns. The Government's evaluation of your past performance will be subjective, and based mainly on performance evaluations available in the automated Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), information obtained from your references during telephone interviews and/or performance questionnaires, and information available in the Government's local files to evaluate past performance. The Government may use other sources, as appropriate. The Government will consider performance of work that you have subcontracted to another firm as your past performance. However, the Government will not consider the past performance of a proposed subcontractor, unless that performance was under a subcon! tract awarded by you. The Government will give greater consideration to contracts requiring the same or similar type and complexity of work required by the RFQ. However, other types of contracts/work may be considered as part of the past performance evaluation as well, if aspects of the past performance are deemed to have some bearing on the expected performance of the subject solicitation. Prepare and submit one Reference Information Sheet for each of the contracts that you would like the Government to consider when evaluating your past performance in the format of Attachment (2). The contracts that you reference must be ongoing or have been completed within the last three years. On the Reference Information Sheet, include the names of references who can verify that you have done the type of work that is required under the contract contemplated by this RFQ and who will provide information about the quality of your past performance. However, the Government may not contact a! ll of your references. If a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) has been completed for one or more of the contracts that you would like to reference, you need not submit a Reference Information Sheet for those contracts. Instead, you may provide a list of such contracts. Make sure that your reference information is up to date and that each reference will cooperate with us. Do not give us the names of a reference unless you have made sure that we can reach that reference at the telephone number, e-mail address, and postal address that you have provided, and that they will give us the information that we want. Offerors shall be determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1. Quotes shall state the unit prices and total prices of the items required, inclusive of shipping to the destination listed above. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: Quotes received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will make!  an offeror ineligible for award. The FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process to satisfy FAR 52.212-3. More information on ORCA is found at https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx.

Task 4:  The contractor shall construct, at a minimum, an encompassing barricade, either natural or man-made, in accordance with ATF 5400.7, Subpart B, Definitions (see Artificial Barricade and Barricaded). This barricade must meet the standard to conform to ATF 5400.7, Section 55.218 - Table of Distances for Storage of Explosive Materials.  The outer edge of the barrier must be two feet from the concrete pad edge on all sides. This barrier serves to contain or deflect a blast in the event of an unexpected detonation of the explosives storage magazine.  The contractor shall build one roof with a minimum of six (6) inch overhang on all sides.  The roof shall contain a sloping angle and proper drainage material.

Task 5:  The contractor shall erect enclosure fencing and access gate.

cash equivalents thereof) due at time of payment computed at rates not less than those contained in the wage determination of the Secretary of Labor which is attached hereto and made a part hereof, or as may be incorporated for a secondary site of the work, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the Contractor and such laborers and mechanics. Any wage determination incorporated for a secondary site of the work shall be effective from the first day on which work under the contract was performed at that site and shall be incorporated without any adjustment in contract price or estimated cost. Laborers employed by the construction Contractor or construction subcontractor 
that are transporting portions of the building or work between the secondary site of the work and the primary site of the work shall be paid in accordance with the wage determination applicable to the primary site of the work. 

(2) Contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this clause; also, regular contributions made or 
costs incurred for more than a weekly period (but not less often than quarterly) under plans, funds, or programs which cover the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such period. 

(3) Such laborers and mechanics shall be paid not less than the appropriate wage rate and fringe benefits in the wage determination for the classification of work actually performed, without regard to skill, except as provided in the clause entitled Apprentices and Trainees. Laborers or mechanics performing work in 
more than one classification may be compensated at the rate specified for each classification for the time actually worked therein; provided, that the employers payroll records accurately set forth the time spent in each classification in which work is performed. 

(4) The wage determination (including any additional classifications and wage rates conformed under paragraph (c) of this clause) and the Davis-Bacon poster (WH-1321) shall be posted at all times by the Contractor and its subcontractors at the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place where it can be easily seen by the workers. 

(c) (1) The Contracting Officer shall require that any class of laborers or mechanics which is not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under the contract shall be classified in conformance with the wage determination. The Contracting Officer shall approve an additional classification and wage rate and fringe benefits therefore only when all the following criteria have been met: 

(i) The work to be performed by the classification requested is not performed by a classification in the wage determination. 

(ii) The classification is utilized in the area by the construction industry. 

(iii) The proposed wage rate, including any bona fide fringe benefits, bears a reasonable relationship to the wage rates contained in the wage determination. 

(2) If the Contractor and the laborers and mechanics to be employed in the classification (if known), or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer agree on the classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), a report of the action taken shall be sent by 
the Contracting Officer to the Administrator of the: 

Wage and Hour Division 
Employment Standards Administration 
U.S. Department of Labor 
Washington, DC 20210 

The Administrator or an authorized representative will approve, modify, or disapprove every additional classification action within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary. 

(3) In the event the Contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the classification, or their representatives, and the Contracting Officer do not agree on the proposed classification and wage rate (including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), the Contracting Officer shall refer the questions, including the views of all interested parties and the recommendation of the Contracting Officer, to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division for determination. The Administrator, or an authorized representative, will issue a determination within 30 days of receipt and so advise the Contracting Officer or will notify the Contracting Officer within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary. 

(4) The wage rate (including fringe benefits, where appropriate) determined pursuant to subparagraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this clause shall be paid to all workers performing work in the classification under this contract from the first day on which work is performed in the classification. 

(d) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly rate, the Contractor shall either pay the benefit as stated in the wage determination or shall pay another bona fide fringe benefit or an hourly cash equivalent thereof. 

(e) If the Contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, the Contractor may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing bona fide fringe benefits under a plan or program; provided, That the Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the Contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the Contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors are listed in order of importance.  When combined, non-price factors are more important than price. 

1)	Technical Conformance to Specifications
2)	Past Performance
3)	Price

Technical Conformance 

The technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical features for conformance with the requirements of the drawings. Evaluation of products will be on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating obtaining any information not identified in the offer. An offer that does not provide sufficient information which describes their capacity to meet the RFQs technical evaluation criteria can result in failure of this evaluation factor. 

Past Performance

Offers shall provide at least two (2) references for recent and relevant contracts for the manufacturing of safety belts.  Reference information must include contract numbers, points of contract names with telephone numbers and other relevant information.  For this factor the Government will evaluate information obtained from past performance information that the Government obtains about the offeror from these contacts or other sources.  Failure to address this requirement can result in failure of this evaluation factor.

Price

Proposals should identify any price reductions offered, or quantity discounts. All responsible sources may submit offers for quantities listed or quantity price breaks which shall be considered by the agency.

Warranties
 
Offerors are required to offer the Government at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice.

(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is  responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA has been providing humanitarian assistance in Pakistan since 2000, responding to natural disasters including earthquakes and floods as well as to the needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have been displaced due to conflict.  Additionally, OFDA has supported disaster risk reduction programs in Pakistan since 2002.  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 and to date in FY 2009, USAID/OFDA has provided more than $9.2 million in humanitarian assistance to Pakistan, including more than $4.3 million to conflict-affected populations and host communities in Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) and more than $4.9 million in response to earthquakes and floods.  At present, OFDA is supporting programs in health, nutrition, humanitarian coordination and information management, risk reduction, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions, non-food items, and logistical support.

Responding to the growing number of IDPs is an important focus for OFDA in Pakistan.
On February 9, 2009, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported a total of 290,845 IDPs in NWFP, with only 59,140 residing within camps.  Relief agencies and district authorities have registered IDPs in Peshawar, Nowshera, Mardan, Kohat, Upper Dir, Lower Dir, Charsadda, Swat, and Swabi districts of NWFP.  Limited humanitarian access remains a challenge in reaching IDPs in many of these areas.  

OBJECTIVE

USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor to be based in either Islamabad or Peshawar, Pakistan, to ensure that OFDAs objectives for disaster assistance, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Islamabad or Peshawar, as determined in consultation with the Embassy and the Mission and subject to security and programmatic considerations.  It also requires willingness to travel within and outside of Pakistan on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer.  The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Pakistan, as well as for other disaster risk reduction and training programs.  The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/Pakistan Mission, the US Embassy and its border office, international organizations (IOs), non governmental organizations (NGOs), the United Nations and NATO-led forces where appropriate, to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA Washington, USAID Pakistan, as required, and U.S. Embassy staff. 

This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the US Embassy and its border office, the Government of Pakistan (GOP), military representatives, as well as with relevant United Nations (UN) and NGO agencies, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  

Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the OFDA Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for Asia and in consultation with USAID/Pakistan, the incumbent will:

	Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in Pakistan for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy and its border office, military representatives, OFDA/Washington and the overall humanitarian community.
	Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDA-funded programs in Pakistan.  
	Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance efforts in Pakistan.  Regularly review partners reports, coordinate with OFDA/Washington on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated Washington and field feedback to the partners.
	Coordinate closely with OFDA/Washington, the USAID Mission, U.S. Embassy and its border office, and military representatives as well as the UN and NGO agencies working in Pakistan.
	Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:
o	Capacity and level of activity of indigenous institutions to carry out relief programs;
o	Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;
o	Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;
o	Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;
o	Impact of GOP activities on humanitarian programs; 
o	Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and  
o	Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.
	Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDAs Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/ Washington.
	Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDAs approach to humanitarian protection.  Work closely with the PRA to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.
	Visit OFDA-funded projects, as security permits, and report on a timely basis to  OFDA/Washington on the quality of grantees work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions.  
	Represent U.S. Government (USG) humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.
	Maintain regular liaison with UN, NGOs, IOs, the GOP, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.
	Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with the PRA and OFDA/Washington.  
	Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.
	Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including monthly official reporting cables or as the situation warrants.
	Ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA PRA for Asia.  However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/Pakistan, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. embassy staff.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from the OFDA PRA and OFDA/Washington.   

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.  The OFDA PRA for Asia will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

12.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.

13.  POINT OF CONTACT:  See Cover Letter.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is  responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

INTRODUCTION

As part of OPS, the OFDA Safety and Security Coordinator (SSC) and Safety and Security Specialist (SSS) play a central role in the U.S. Governments (USGs) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs.  The Safety and Security Unit (SSU) assists the office in identifying, evaluating and mitigating safety and security risks to OFDA field operations.  The SSU monitors security issues and events, develops security strategies, protocols and procedures, and maintains a cadre of qualified security professionals available for OFDA deployments.  The OFDA SSU also promotes enhanced safety and security approaches in the wider humanitarian community, including NGOs and United Nations (UN) agencies, through their outreach and donor activities.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC><p><strong>5/13/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CDC received the following question</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Understanding that questions are not due until June 1, 2009, we have a question with regard to the page limit that we believe is critical to offerors as they work to prepare their best responses to this RFP. We wish to clarify that the page limit is indeed 75 pages, inclusive of appendices. Based on experiences bidding other CDC RFPs where this language was included in the RFP and then subsequently amended so that appendices were considered outside the 75-page limit, we wish to clarify this as early as possible in the bid process. To learn that the appendices are excluded the page limit after June 1 will make it virtually impossible for offerors to respond appropriately by the June 22 deadline.
<p>If the page limit stands as it is currently stated in the RFP, we appreciate the clarification and will respond accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>CDC response</strong>:&nbsp;reference Section 'L' on page 50 of the Solicitation, subparagraph L.9 which reads:</p>
<p>L.9 Proposal page format:</p>
<p>Pages shall be 8 &frac12; x 11, Times New Roman font, 12 pt pitch. Page fold-outs will count as 2 pages. Text printed on double-sided pages will also count as two pages. <strong>Where a page limit applies</strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the page limit includes</strong></span> cover letter, table of contents, index, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">appendices</span></strong>, attachments, illustrations, charts, tables, diagrams <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and all other documents</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The solicitation stipulates a <strong>75-page limit</strong> for the <strong>Technical Proposal</strong>; thus, since a page limit applies to the Technical Proposal, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>then appendices are included in the page limit</strong></span> pursuant to the instructions in subparagraph L.9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp; End of 5/13/09 Amendment ----</p>

<p><strong>CDC's response is as follows</strong>:</p>
<p>The following are the variable fields that I have in the data sets from FEMA:<br /><br />In the applicant database (NEMIS) there are:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />Name - first, last, middle initial<br />Applied date - date applied for assistance<br />email<br />Pre-disaster address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />Current address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />phone number - area code, number<br />alternative phone number - alt area code, alt phone number<br />Social security number<br /><br />FRRATS databases for the states:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />name - first, last<br />Site address (trailer location address) - street, city, state, zip, county<br />lease date<br />vacate date</p>
<p>CDC makes no representation as to the accuracy, completeness or usefulness&nbsp;of the information contained in the FEMA NEMIS database.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Pre-solicitation notice</strong>:<br />This pre-solicitation notice is posted pursuant to FAR 5.203(a), to advise interested offerors of the Government's intent to solicit proposals for a "full and open" competitive acquisition for a project titled: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children's Health Study</span> (CHS). The attached draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) describes the Government's objectives for this acquisition. Offerors responding to the solicitation (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">when it is released</span>) will be responsible for developing and submitting their own Statement of Work (SOW) based upon the objectives contained in the attached draft SOO.</p>
<p><br />The contracting officer's "full and open" acquisition strategy decision is based upon the Government's evaluation of capability statements received in response to a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) posted to FEDBIZOPS on 2/17/2009. The Government will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> accept or consider additional capability statements at this time because the market research phase has ended.</p>
<p>In addition to the draft SOO, this notice also includes questions received in response to the Request for Information (RFI) posted on 11/21/ 2008 and the Government's responses. The attachment was previously posted with the aforementioned SSS and is provided again as a convenience to those interested offerors who may be unfamiliar with the "history" of this acquisition.</p>
<p><br /><strong>No response to this notice is requested or required.</strong></p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for proposals. The contracting officer will request proposals when the solicitation is posted to FEDBIZOPS some time after this 15-day mandatory, preliminary notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The Government anticipates making a single contract award for a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) type contract. The rough order magnitude (ROM) of the contemplated contract is between $100Million to $150Million. As explained in the attached draft SOO, the resulting contract will consist of two phases: (1) A two-year Feasibility Study and (2) a six-year Full Study phase.</p>
<p><br />Any questions regarding this notice must be in writing to the contracting officer via email: ftg7@cdc.gov prior to the expiration date of this notice.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences intend to award a sole source, one year firm fixed price contract, in accordance FAR Part 12- Acquisition of Commercial Items to the University of California, 1001 Potrero, San Francisco, CA 94103. The University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) has the only yeast library for botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). No other antibodies have been able to give the same quality of results as UCSF. CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are classified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as one of the 6 highest-risk threat agents for bioterrorism (the "Category A agents"), due to their extreme potency and lethality, ease of production and transport, and need for prolonged intensive care. BoNTs have been produced and weaponized by rogue nations and deployed by terrorist groups. BoNTs can intoxicate via the aerosol or oral route and are the most poisonous substances known; a human oral LD50 being approximately 50 ug. As a result of this potency, sensitive assays are needed. Assays would be used both to screen for and detect the presence of BoNT in high volume food products, such as milk and other beverages, as well as for rapid and sensitive diagnosis from the serum of intoxicated individuals. Such assays must be: 1) very sensitive; 2) detect active BoNT; and 3) be able to function in complex sample mixtures such as milk and serum. The CDC has developed a sensitive mass spectrometry assay that detects BoNT cleavage of synthetic toxin substrates. For this assay to work in complex mixtures, a sample preparation step is required which consists of using an antibody to capture the toxin. This is an absolute requirement for the assay to function.</p>
<p>UCSF has been generating high affinity monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the botulinum neurotoxins. For this proposed work to continue, the collaboration with CDC will: 1) generate and evaluate mAbs for mass spectrometry based detection of the remaining BoNT serotypes including BoNT/D and BoNT/C-D mosaics and BoNT/G; 2) provide adequate quantities (100 mg/year) of each of the reference antibodies for the seven BoNT serotypes to allow adequate quantities of antibody for diagnostic testing; 3) generate and provide stable cell lines expressing each of the seven reference antibodies to the CDC to enable antibody production going forward; and 4) generate ricin binding IgG which can be used for sensitive detection of ricin by mss spectrometry.</p>
<p>CDC believes that UCSF is the only source available to provide this product that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurment based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 611310.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Thaddeus Rollins via email to tnr6@cdc.gov using the reference number 2009-Q-11261 in the subject line, no later than 5:00 pm Eastern Time, 28 May 2009.</p>

<DESC>This project is set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses.

It is estimated that the solicitation for this project will be posted electronically on April 22, 2009.  Contractors will have electronic access to this solicitation at this website.  No hard copies will be mailed.  Technical questions should be addressed to the contact listed in the solicitation when it becomes available.  

This project involves replacing existing galvanized waterlines at Lakeside, Prosser Family, and Prosser Group Campgrounds with approximately 2900 feet of new High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipe of various sizes, removing existing hydrants, and installing 17 new campground hydrants.  One new air release valve will be needed.  A small amount of cutting and replacing asphalt concrete will be needed to cross one road. 

OPTION:  The option involves replacing approximately 180 of existing 6 asbestos-concrete pipe with new 4 HDPE pipe under Prosser Road.  This requires cutting and replacing asphalt concrete on the road.  Additionally, all the valves, drains, and unions at the connection point will need to be replaced.  The contractor will need to submit a traffic control plan.  The existing 6 asbestos concrete pipe and disconnected service lines will be capped and abandoned in place.

 Project Location 
From Truckee, CA, take Highway 89 north 3.1 miles and turn right (east) at the sign for Prosser Campground.  The Lakeside Campground is one mile down Prosser Road, the Prosser Family Campground is 1.5 miles in, and the Group Campground is 1.7 miles in.  (All are on the north side of the main road and on the south side of Prosser Reservoir.)

The Government's estimate is:   $100,000 and $250,000.

Estimated Start Date

<DESC>This is modification 2 to the pre-solicitation synopsis entitled ISS Cargo MissionContract (CMC), Solicitation Number NNJ09ZBG003R which was posted on April 16, 2009. This serves as notification that:The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at Johnson Space Center (JSC) isrequesting information, and soliciting responses from interested parties, on contractualapproaches and synergies for the Cargo Mission and Flight Crew Equipment (FCE) processingcontract.NASA is planning the acquisition strategy for the Cargo Mission Contract (CMC) follow-onfrom October 2010 to the end of the program, currently identified as January 2016. Sinceno follow-on contract to Space Program Operations Contract (SPOC) is currently planned,the proposed CMC follow-on contract will include FCE processing and depot supportcurrently performed under the SPOC, which ends in October, 2010.   An industry day washeld May 4, 2009 which described work as it is currently performed and managed under CMCand the SPOC FCE effort.  Those charts are posted athttp://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/isscmc	  .  The work content expected in the follow-onwill not be identical to the industry day presentations.  Differences are noted below.Note:  Our current plans for work on the CMC follow-on (including FCE) do not includework that is in support of the Shuttle Program.  However, the decision to include ShuttleProgram requirements could change depending on the magnitude of changes to the ShuttleProgram currently being debated in congress.  The schedule for this follow-on contractcould also slip should the Shuttle program extend beyond October 2010 as another methodof dealing with changes to Shuttle plans.  The Cargo Mission support consists of analytical and physical processing activities tosupport pressurized cargo for visiting vehicle flights (including International Partnerand United States vehicles) to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Unpressurized sustaining engineering and cargo processing (both analytical and physical)are not planned for this procurement.  This procurement will include a capability tobuild hardware to support pressurized and un-pressurized cargo for transportation to ISS. Once delivered, this equipment will be sustained by other means.  Also, sustainingengineering and logistics functions for Stowage Accommodations (i.e Cargo Transfer Bags(CTBs), M-bags, and dividers) are planned to be included in this procurement.  Pre-packedcargo will be shipped to launch sites within the United States, French Guiana, Kazakhstanand Japan.  This effort includes the production of hardware decals, maintainingconfiguration control, safety & mission assurance, and supporting ISS program reviews andflight readiness activities.  Typical cargo processing activities include but are not limited to the following:Pressurized Developing Bag Layouts Analytical and Physical Integration of Cargo into Packed Bags Hardware Receiving Inspection and Requirements Verification Bench Review Shipping Packed Bags to the Launch Destinations Developing Integrated Bag Level Hazard Assessments Retrieval and Turnover of Returned CargoThis contract will also include Flight Crew Equipment processing activities to supportflight and training requirements for the ISS and Constellation Programs.  This effortincludes but is not limited to procuring, maintaining, and processing.	Typical FCE underthis procurement includes but is not limited to the following: Crew Clothing Personal Hygiene Items Housekeeping Items Audio/Video Equipment and Associated Cabling Laptop Computers and Support Equipment Batteries Crew Survival EquipmentNote:  Food and EVA processing/hardware are not included as part of this procurement.NASA requests specific capability statements including industry comments on approaches tothe questions below.  Indicate your ability to perform this work as the prime or asubcontractor, and what portions of the work you would subcontract as the prime.1. Contract Transition:  suggest ideas for executing a transition from the current CMCand FCE contracts to the combined follow-on contract while ensuring continuity ofoperations (without interruption) for the Shuttle and ISS Programs, based on the currentISS visiting vehicle launch milestones.a. Facilities and Equipment (note: specific location of facilities like Kennedy SpaceCenter (KSC), JSC, non-government, etc. will not be a contract requirement ) i. Provide an assessment of the type and size of the facilities required based on theexisting Statement of Works (SOW).ii. How could the availability of government provided facilities help or hinder theefficient processing of cargo?	iii. Provide a preliminary schedule to complete required facility modifications for yourproposed facility, to transfer and incorporate the planned Government furnished FCE andGSE to your proposed facility, and to accomplish all required recertification. b. Data  i. Provide an assessment of the applications/tools required to support a structuredsystem for identifying, preparing, receiving, transmitting, controlling, verifying,releasing, tracking, accounting, and dispositioning Program data and establishing dataquality standards for ISS Program data and documentation.  ii. How might the retirement of Shuttle Program data management systems affect access toprocesses and data?  iii. Provide a preliminary schedule to complete the required data collection andintegration for your proposed system.c. How can you ensure the seamless transition of in-process work for flights in flow onday 1 of this contract?   For example, how would you handle an HTV launch 6 months aftercontract start when analytical/physical integration has already begun?d. What other transition issues might arise out of Shuttle retirement?2. Contract Structure: a. What type of contract provides the best approach for this type of work? b. How should the risks versus rewards be shared by the Government and contractor? c. How does the proposed contract type incentivize the contractor to perform high qualitywork at a reasonable price? d. Discuss your views specific to this contract regarding incentive fees, award fee,award term and/or other appropriate incentives for contractor performance in terms of: i. Fixed price requirementsii. Cost type requirements.e. Suggest any portions of this procurement for which fixed price contracting could beutilized.  Discuss your rationale for each and your thoughts on the feasibility and risksof each. f. Provide an assessment of how cargo processing may best be purchased, e.g. by the kgversus bag count g. How should the government balance maximizing cargo upmass and efficient use ofon-orbit ISS crew time for unpacking? h. Discuss all alternatives you would like NASA to consider to ensure that small businessgoals are met or exceeded. i. What components (tasks, %) of this work could realistically be performed by a small ordisadvantaged business?  What components should not be performed by a small ordisadvantaged business? 3. What barriers to competition are foreseen for the described work and what can be doneto mitigate them?4. How should the government handle a potential delay in remaining Shuttle flights as itpertains to initiation of this contract?5. What minimum set of data should the government provide in the RFP to support proposaldevelopment and what are the implications if the government is not able to provide all ofthe requested data? What alternatives can you recommend, for example, how would wedetermine if it is more cost effective to recertify or provide new equivalent hardwareversus obtaining the current data set?6. What challenges do you see and what solutions can you offer to aid the transition ofdata required for FCE?To view a copy of NASAs current statement of work for CMC and SPOC FCE, visit thefollowing web page:  http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/isscmc	  Interested offerors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the requirementsmay provide a capabilities statement that shall not exceed 20 pages.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an integral part of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and its mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs associated with motor vehicle crashes. To accomplish this, NHTSA collects and analyzes motor vehicle crash data and develops, promotes, and implements educational programs, vehicle safety standards, research, and enforcement programs. 
Data suggest that sobriety checkpoints in combination with publicity can be effective in reducing crashes.  However, sobriety checkpoint programs have not achieved a significant general deterrence effect when examined in terms of program awareness, self-reported behavior change, and perception of increased likelihood of being stopped by the police and arrested.  There is a need to improve general deterrence so that enforcement programs can be more effective and the crash reduction effects sustained.  There is a need to improve the visibility of enforcement programs.

Description: 

The objective of this requirement is to assess the effectiveness of an earlier checkpoint start time and accompanying signage in raising public awareness of sobriety checkpoint activity and raising the publics perceived risk of an alcohol-impaired driver being stopped and arrested.  This requirement will include eight (8) tasks: (1) Final Refined Work Plan, (2) Recruit Sites, (3) Prepare for Baseline Telephone Survey, (4) Prepare for On-Site Intervention Activity, (5) Conduct Telephone Surveys, (6) Implement Sobriety Checkpoint Intervention Activity, (7) Brief NHTSA on Results and (8) Submit Final Report Deliverables.  All work required including preparation, submission, review, and acceptance of the final report shall be completed within thirty-two (32) months after the effective date of the contract.
The NAICS Code for this contract is 541720.  It is the Governments intent to award a Cost plus fixed fee type contract for a performance period not to exceed thirty-six (36) months.  It is the Offerors responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Requests for paper copies of the RFP will not be accepted. The estimated date for release of the solicitation is on or about May 22, 2009. 



Period of Performance: Thirty-six (36) months starting on or about 9/8/2009.



RFP Number: DTNH22-09-R-00220



Contract Award:

NHTSA intends to issue a full and open, competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) with the intention of awarding a Cost plus fixed fee  type contract for a performance period not to exceed thirty-six (36) months.  All questions regarding this posting must be submitted in writing via e-mail to sherese.gray@dot.gov no later than June 1, 2009.

Contact Point(s): Eugene Crank, Technical Reviewer, 805-982-5589 Response Due Date: 15 MAY 2009
Description:This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the NAVFAC Engineering Service Center (ESC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement is open until 15 May 2009. NAVFAC ESC is interested in a software based model that can be used to analyze the integration of photovoltaic systems, wind energy systems, conventional diesel generation, and energy storage. The model should address design issues related to the following: 
. Renewable energy resources have intermittent availability (e.g., wind speed varies, isolation varies, etc.). . Space limitations often restrict energy storage strategies and capacity of RE generation that can be installed. . There may be multiple renewable energy systems installed where little or no configuration was made to accommodate future integration and control. . Maintaining micro-grid/building-level circuit stability during outage
The purpose of the model includes the following: . to provide analysis needed to optimize use of photovoltaic (PV) power and wind power, diesel generation and maintaining stability during outage. provide analysis of energy storage requirements. provide an analysis needed to integrate multiple planned/unplanned PV and wind power 
This announcement is for abstracts only and shall be no more than five (5) pages of technical material. The abstracts shall outline the topics of interest. The abstract may be supplemented by resumes and list of publications relevant to this announcement which will not count against the five (5) page limit. The award will be for up to $400,000. Multiple awards may be made under this announcement. Topics of interest described below are provided as guides to areas that must be included in the abstract for the model. Also, it is expected that abstracts will not limit the approach to only these specified in the topic list. Individual topics of interest are as follows:
1) The model will include solar and wind generation, energy storage, and controls that isolate the building in event of a power failure, and integrate renewable power with that from diesel back-up emergency generators. 2) The model will be enhanced by incorporating data from manufacturer performance data. 3) The model will provide an analysis of interoperability, performance characteristics and financial performance of various integrated renewable systems and back-up diesel generation. Measure system response time, first cost, output, reliability, maintenance and percent load provided. Test and recommend strategies to power isolated loads directly from renewable systems, isolate buildings from the grid or control renewable and emergency generators via control systems (e.g., Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems).4) The model will predict interoperability of distributed, multiple, installation level renewables systems. The results will be used to recommend technical guidance for implementation multiple renewable systems through-out a Navy base for maximum benefit.

The software model shall be compatible with running on a MS Windows based computer without having to make non-standard operating system modification(s). Past experience with utilities related computer modeling, renewable energy systems, power generation is desired. 
Evaluation Board (TEB) may request a full scale Proposal of no more than 25 pages. NAVFAC ESC may share the abstracts and the proposals with other Dept. of Defense (DOD) personnel of offices associated with this topic. Information that is sensitive or proprietary must so be marked page by page in the abstract and or proposal. Multiple awards may be made. The request for a proposal does not obligate the government in awarding a contract. CRITICAL NOTE: A CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR). NO CONTRACT AWARD WlLL BE MADE TO ANY CONTRACTOR THAT IS NOT REGISTERED OR IN THE PROCESS OF REGISTERING WITH THE DOD CCR THE DOD CCR MAY BE REACHED AT (888) 227.2423, OR WEBSITE WWW.CCR.GOV. THERE IS NO COMMITMENT BY THE NAVY EITHER TO MAKE ANY CONTRACT AWARDS OR TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MONEY EXPENDED BY THE CONTRACTOR BEFORE A CONTRACT AWARD. ONLY A WARRANTED CONTRACTING OFFICER CAN OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT. Any informa! tion that may be sensitive to review by such personnel should not be submitted. Eligibility notification will be sent to all contractors, who have submitted an abstract, after the Navys TEB has reviewed all abstracts submitted by an internal periodic cut-off date. The internal periodic cut-off date may occur several times within the period from the BAA announcement to the closing date for receipt of abstracts. Abstracts may be submitted at any time, but to ensure review by the TEB, abstracts should be received by 15 May 2009. Abstracts received after this date may or may not be evaluated by the TEB and will be dependent upon the results of the evaluations and budgetary constraints. For technical questions regarding this BAA, contact Gene Crank by telephone at (805) 982-5589 or via e-mail at eugene.crank@navy.mil.

Timber breakwaters at the mouth of Pantego Creek were authorized for construction by the Corps of Engineers in 1938. These breakwaters provide protection to Belhaven Harbor, Beaufort County, North Carolina, about 140 miles east of Raleigh. The proposed project consists of replacing the damaged breakwaters which are each about 1900 feet long, at the entrance to Pantego Creek, separated by a central 500 foot navigation opening. The existing breakwaters are of a unique fence-like design made of timber pilings, which project above and slightly below the normal water surface. These structures were designed to dampen waves entering the harbor while maintaining some water circulation through and under the breakwater. The face of each breakwater is comprised of 4-foot 8-inch long pales (4 x 8) on 12-inch centers (with a nominal 4-in opening between pales) mounted on 8 x 8 horizontal timber wales. The breakwater face is angled back slightly (about 10 degrees) and has a top height of about 3.5 feet above the water surface and extends about one-foot below the water surface. The face is supported by 12-in diameter treated pilings constructed in clusters of three, each with a forward piling and two rear batter piles. The proposed project will include removal of the remaining aging chemically treated timber structure and replacing it with a timber structure having the same basic design features. <br /><br />This announcement is part of our market research, and responses are sought to identify sources that have the knowledge, skills, and capability to perform the work.

Statement of Work as Follows:
Services, labor, and material to refurbish the parts identified in solicitation for the AN/TPS-59 Radar System as required by MCLB Barstow, California.  The refurbishment process is very extensive and time consuming, as each individual piece of the radar requires a different process for refurbishment and then requires unique skills to facilitate system reconstruction.  
The refurbishment process requires military compliant cleaning, stripping, blasting and surface renewal capabilities through chemical and mechanical means.  Adherence to industry and military standards may include, but are not limited to: TT-C-490, MIL-C-10578, and MIL-STD-1504 for parts, and MIL-T-704 for chemical resistant steels.  Adherence to military compliant plating and chemical film capabilities large enough to process the parts is also required.  Adherence to industry and military standards may include, but are not limited to: QQ-P-416 class 1 type III for cadmium plating, MIL-C-5541 class 1A and class 3 for chemical film (chemical conversion coating (alodine)), MIL-A-8625 all classes and types for anodizing, MIL-C-13924 class I, II, III, and IV for black oxide, QQ-N-290 class 1 and 2 for electrodeposited nickel, QQ_P-35  type II, VI, VII, and VIII for passivating steel parts, ASTM B633 type I, II, III, IV for zinc plating.
The company must possess sufficient engineering capabilities to determine the appropriate scope of work to bring all parts to like new condition.  The refurbishment process requires a military compliant welding capability to repair what is generally major structural damage caused by years of operations in a hostile environment.  Adherence to industry and military standards may include, but are not limited to: ASTM E14444 for magnetic particle inspection and MIL-STD-6866, penetrant inspection, type I and type II,  method A- fluorescent dye, method B- post emulsifiable (lipophiliac), method C- solvent removable, method D- post emulsifiable (hydrophiliac).  A military compliant solvent based paint facility for applying epoxy primers and CARC paints in strict accordance with the drawings and specifications is also required. Adherence to industry and military standards may include, but are not limited to: TT-P-1757 type I and TT-P-645 for yellow primers, MIL-P-53022 type I and II!  for epoxy coating, MIL-E-15090 type I, II, III class 2 for gray paints, MIL-C-53039 green 383, MIL-C-46168 type II, III, IV black polyurethane coating, FED-STD-595 sand NO. 33531, TT-E 529 olive drab, and all finishes are applied per MIL-F-14072.  A silkscreen facility for equipment part markings in accordance with MIL-STD-130 is also required.
A cleaning facility is required to remove all existing surface contaminants, paint, plating, chemical conversion coating (alodine), surface treatments and any other non-conforming materials.  Cleaning and stripping must remove all surface obstructions and contamination without altering the dimension of the part or weakening the structural integrity of the part. 
The scope of work for the refurbishment process is as follows:
Clean and strip all existing surface contaminants, paint and corrosion through a chemical stripping process or passive blast method if required to remove all existing paint, surface contaminants and corrosion.  This process must not degrade the metal or weaken the structural integrity of the part with heavy blast material being used upon it.  It also does not alter the dimension of the part, ensuring that the part remains compliant throughout the process.
A chemical strip known as an acid wash is done to remove all existing plating and contaminants remaining on the metal.  This process uses a variety of acid based solutions, depending on the type of plating and base metal.  This process is required to remove all existing chemical plating and contaminants on the metal before the repair and refurbish process can continue.
The repair/refurbish phase starts with the part being evaluated for all repairs required.  Welding, machining, drilling, tapping, straightening, and cutting of the piece may be required for complete compliance to the drawing for each part.  Holes, scratches, dings and any other imperfections in the part shall be repaired.  Hardware is repaired and/or replaced, tracing threads to repair and clean screw holes.  Heli-coil, Kingcerts and nut plates are repaired and/or replaced to conform to the drawing requirements.  Historically, the overwhelming majority of parts (above 90 percent) require some type of mechanical process to bring the product back into compliance with the drawing.
After the repair phase the passive test phase begins.  A dimension test is done on each piece to check straightness, hole size, connector jack size and shape.  All hardware is checked for proper operation and any other specific requirements required from the drawing for each piece.  In addition, non-destructive testing is performed on all welds and other mechanical processes to ensure they are compliant with the relevant specification.
After the passive test phase comes the prep for chemical coating phase.  The equipment is prepped with a scotch bright pad to clean, prep and form pitted areas on the metal to remove imperfections left by corrosion.  An acid bath is once again used to clean the metal and open the pores so the metal will properly and evenly accept the chemical coating.  Each chemical coating process is different.  Some parts require coatings of more than one type on the same part.  The chemical coating processes widely used on this system are chemical conversion coating (alodine), passivate, electroless nickel, black oxide, zinc, cadmium and anodize.  Each form of coating protects different kinds of metal in different ways and are done in different colors as well.  Some of the coatings have an electricity conducting quality and others do not.  This is very important for the parts that require that capability and for those that do not, as some have shielding requirements and some have conducti! ve requirements.  The chemical coating phase is complete when the proper tests have been performed on the products.  All products are tested for plating thickness, coverage and conductivity.  In addition, test panels are run with the products and are tested for various properties like thickness, adhesion, corrosion resistance, conductivity, heat resistance and flexural failure. 
After the chemical coating phase comes the prime, paint and stencil stage.  The part is thoroughly cleaned to remove excess chemical coating and any other debris before prime.  The part is masked in accordance with the drawing with military compliant masking materials.  It is then primed in accordance with the relevant military specification and baked in an oven to cure the primer.  This process is repeated if two coats of primer are required per the drawing.  The part is then painted in accordance with the relevant military specification and baked and painted and baked again per drawing.  All TPS-59 Radar parts require two coats of paint per the drawing.  A paint thickness test, surface finish test and paint adhesion are performed on each part to make sure the part is compliant to the print and relevant military specification and that the paint will adhere to the part.  The part is then stenciled or silk screened to mark it with its part numbers and letters identifying it a! nd any other stencils are applied as per the print.  The contractor shall use military compliant solvent based paints and not water based paints on the paint phase and marking phase of the process.  The radar will be used in an extremely harsh environment and the use of solvent based paint is required.
The final process of the part is cleaning and packaging for shipping.  Each individual part is unmasked, cleaned per military specifications QQ-PP-416, MIL-C-5541, and MIL-A-8625 and packaged using the best (military or commercial) practice.  Packaging cannot allow for any damage to the part during shipping or storage.
Through each stage the part shall be rigorously inspected for workmanship, form, fit, and function.  Each inspection and test shall be marked on the job traveler and fully documented for review.  In accordance with NADCAP and ISO procedures, these records remain on file for seven (7) years after the project is complete.
Delivery and installation will be in BARSTOW, CA. 92311  Please provide a delivery/installation timeline.  Final details on delivery will be negotiated at award.

<DESC>QUESTION 1
Deliverable #1: .The report shall provide a written description and overall drawings of each structure.  Deteriorated areas shall be indicated on plans, elevations, and sectional drawings.  The report shall include at least two alternative repair solutions"
It appears that there are at least 5 structures on the site and maybe more.  Just producing plans for these structures is and major undertaking since there is no guarantee that the original drawings discussed in 1.1 are accurate, reflect modifications, or exist for each structure yet the contractor will be held responsible for turning in accurate plans for each structure.  Without a full engineering analysis of each structure including core samples for structural members above/below grade and above/below the water level the production of detailed sectional drawings of deterioration and detailed repair options is not feasible considering the labor hours for the engineers estimated in the DM.  Repair solution can only be based on what we can observe, for example if a below grade foundation member that we could not observe was deteriorated this could be a factor in repairs made to structural members we could observe if the repair work would shift dead or live loads during the work.  If accurate plans exist for all structures and will be provided to the contractor we could provide a report indicating where damage was observed and keyed those observations to the drawings.  Repair options could be discussed in some detail but could not be guaranteed to be sound since they were based on only what could be observed.
ANSWER 1
The TOR is for a Feasibility Study, not a pre-engineering or engineering study.  Deliverable #1 for the structures can be accomplished by looking at the structures.  The main purpose is to determine whether these structures have any practical use in the planned development.  If so, then any improvements or rehabilitation are to be presented as concepts with general cost estimates.
QUESTION 2
3.1.1 A survey of existing tugs and barges operating on the Rio Magdalena indicating the size, draft age of the tugs, and the size, capacity, draft, and age of the barges
A survey conveys a visual observance of these vessels which would be very labor intensive and those hours are included in the DM original cost estimates.  Is it the intent of the RFP to have the contractor review existing registration/documentation documents maintained by the Government of Colombia for this task or is an actual survey to take place?  If it is a document review will the Government grant the contractor permission to review its files?  Lastly, if it is a document review, do the documentscontain information on the vessel size, capacity, draft, age, horsepower or KW, and equipment such as radios, navigation lighting, and depth sounders?
ANSWER 2
The tug and barge survey should present an overall picture of what is currently available, not a detail listing of registrations, etc.  The purpose is to determine if the tugs and barges there could service the proposed facility and how that would affect cost.
QUESTION 3
4.2 develop at least 3 alternative arrangements of the terminal The alternatives shall consider, as a minimum, the following aspects: 4.2.4  Improvements or modifications to storage, administration, and other structures and supporting utilities.  4.2.5 Improvements to the internal roads of the Port and connections with the road from Bogota to Puerto SalgarDeliverable #4:  The contractor shall prepare a report derailing each alternative including background materials, drawings, illustrations, cost estimates, and descriptive analysis and recommendations...
It is reasonable to produce conceptual drawings and provide rough cost estimates (ROM) for each concept.  If we are providing engineering drawings for road improvements, new structures, and utility upgrades the cost of each will far exceed the estimated total project cost.
ANSWER 3
Conceptual drawings and cost estimates of the terminal alternatives are meant to present different approaches to developing the property to determine the most likely route for development.
QUESTION 4
6.2.1 Prepare an outline of the required licensing procedures and preliminary assessment of the terminals impact and appropriate mitigating measures to take.
Will a separate assessment be required for each alternative arrangement?  
ANSWER 4
Yes.  As far as the supporting infrastructure is concerned this is a preliminary assessment with an outline of what may have to be implemented and a separate assessment is required for each alternative arrangement.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide answers to questions received by interested partiesThis is not a Request For Proposals.  This is a Request For Information (RFI) for market research purposes only in accordance with FAR Part 10, and it in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  The Government invites voluntary responses and will treat responses as information only for planning purposes.  Accordingly, respondents shall bear the cost (direct or indirect) of responding to this RFI.  Market research is being conducted primarily to identify the extent and nature of available commercial sources and to determine the range of prices.  There is no solicitation document available at this time, and a solicitation may be issued at a later date.  Information received from this RFI may or may not be used in developing an acquisition strategy and work statement or statement of objectives.  Interested parties must adequately mark proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.THE RESPONSE DATE IS OCTOBER 30, 2008, 4:30 PM, Central Standard Time1.	Are vendors, who do not respond to this RFI request, precluded from participation during the RFP competition?  		No.2.	Regarding pricing. The RFI states: "VA requests information about how you license/price your product-e.g. by user, by site". Does this mean that you are looking for actual pricing by site? Or are you just looking for the model of how we price? VA is looking for the model not the price.3.	Is there an existing purchased claims application that the VA is using that you are looking to integrate with or are you looking to purchase an application as part of this engagement?VA intends to purchase an application.  4.	Is there a limit to the number of pages that you would like for this initial response?  There is no limit to the number of pages.5.	Are there any formatting requirements for this initial response?  There are no formatting requirements.  6.	Is there an anticipated timeframe for a Solicitation release?  Currently this information is not available.7.	Is this a re-compete of an incumbent contract or a new requirement? If there is an incumbent, I would like to learn the name of the incumbent contract, the contract number, the expiration date, and the total value, including any and all options. No, this is a new requirement.8.	What is the average number of claims processed per month?Average Claims Processed per month (approximate): Enterprise Level: 700,000VISN Level: 32,000Site Level: 5,0009.	What is the maximum number of claims you have experience in a given month?Maximum number of claims any given month (approximate):Enterprise: 800,000VISN Level: 61,000Site Level: 33,00010.	Based on how the solicitation reads, it appears like you are looking for a Custom off the Shelf solution.  Is that correct or are you open to having a solution developed?VA intends to use an application, such as, a COTS (Commercial-Off-the-Shelf)  package.11.	Please clarify: Is this opportunity specifically a small business set aside or can large businesses prime? Currently this has not been determined.12.	Please confirm: The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541519 (Other Computer Related Services). The size standard is $25M. The statement refers to the U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) determination of what constitutes a small business for a given NAICS code.  A small business size standard is numerical and represents the largest a concern can be and still be considered a small business.   Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 19 for additional information.  At this time a determination has not been made as to whether the opportunity will be specifically a small business set aside or if a large business can be a prime contractor.13.	Is the VHA seeking to acquire a systems-only solution, or is the VHA seeking to acquire a complete solution to include labor to perform the activities described within the RFI that support the systems solution.  Please clarify.VA is only seeking: product; implementation; and training.14.	Could you please clarify what the VA is looking for in item 4 under Additional Information? Reference to any existing government contract vehicles that you may hold.15.	Is the response to this solicitation to be sent via email? Multiple copies?  Via e-mail only (one copy).16.	Are you looking for a pre-existing package to perform the actions you were looking for or is this something a company may develop in a six (6) month timeframe? VA is seeking a pre-existing package, such as, COTS (Commercial-Off-the-Shelf).17.	Please confirm that you are asking for a software only solution and that you are not asking for claims processing services.  Yes.18.	The RFI says, "eliminate manual data entry" and "ensuredata is accurate and complete" - Are you looking for 100% accuracy from the OCR solution?  OCR depends upon image quality so a manual verification step will likely be needed to attain 100% or near 100% accuracy rates the RFI seems to require.  Please comment. Yes, we are looking for 100% accuracy.19.	Provide integrated claims scrubbing functionality - I read this to mean that you would like a solution that will "de-indentify" or "redact" sensitive information that doesn't or shouldn't be shared with outside or non-VA providers.  Is that correct? No, the claim scrubber requirement is to apply industry standard healthcare claim edits.20.	The RFI specifically says you are strongly encouraging small businesses to respond.  I am sure we qualify for that small business designation but where do I find the rules regarding this issue?  Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 19.  Information is also available on the following SBA web site: http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/indexguide/index.html  21.	Will there be a pre-bid meeting for this RFP? This is an RFI, not an RFP.  VA is conducting market research and the decision is will be made at a later date.22.	Is there a submittal date or deadline for vendor proposal information? Deadline for responses to the RFI is 10/30/08, 4:30 PM Central Standard Time.	23.	Would you prefer this information be emailed or mailed to you? 			An email is preferred.24.	Asked for clarification as to how this requirement is different from FBCS claims support being used by Austin Financial Services Center. Purchased Care is an interim solution.25.	What is the process [for responding to RFI]?Interested parties are advised to follow the instructions in the FedBizOpps notice (including supplements) and refer any questions to Wayne Miller whose contact information is provided in the notice.
