The relatively small rig provides greater field phenotyping flexibility and less disturbance than do more common and larger commercial sprayer rigs. The Avenger fully hydrostatic power drive provides boom, platform height and wheel track adjustments with cm level precision, which accommodates a wide diversity of measurable crops and field conditions. Another major benefit of an Avenger platform reproduction is the ability to interchange customized modular components like the APU/AC and bracket, or other in-house component builds, between the same models of vehicles. So we could conceivably move our power or logging systems from one Avenger rig to another without modification. Additionally, our research collaborations with the University of Arizona phenotyping group would be enhanced because they also utilize LeeAgra products for their mobile platforms. </span></p>

Purchasing another Avenger rig would eliminate the need for understanding and documenting multiple versions of components like hydraulic, electronic and software control systems. And as headquartered in Lubbock, Texas, LeeAgra provides expeditious service and parts sourcing and have proven to be responsive to our service requests and open with their advice.</span></p>

The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.
(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.
(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 3 years.

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for repair and maintenance of most of the equipment at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU or the Government) and Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI or the Government).  Section B, the Equipment Pricing spreadsheet, is an attachment.  The Government plans to issue time-and-material (T&amp;M) and/or firm-fixed price (FFP) blanket purchase agreement(s) (BPAs) to maximize the cost savings to the Government.  Please read the entire solicitation to understand the procurement process before completing this Excel document.  We strongly encourage you to ask timely questions if issues are unclear.  All questions will be answered with an amendment to this request for quotes (RFQ).&emsp;</p>
<p>B. Pricing</p>
<p>Refer to the attached HU0001-16-Q-0001 Equipment Pricing spreadsheet (.xlsx file).  Offerors must complete and submit this electronic document for award consideration.  Please note the Equipment Pricing spreadsheet has two sheets within the file: One for equipment information and one for pricing sheet.&emsp;</p>
<p>C. Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>C.1 General Overview:</p>
<p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU or the Government) and Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI or the Government-or collectively referred to as USU), located in Bethesda, MD, has a requirement to streamline our medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous equipment service procurements.  Historically, USU has issued individual purchase orders for each piece of equipment.  This solicitation will secure these services for nearly all equipment using awards that are designed to reduce administration, reduce down time, and maximize cost savings through reduced administrative costs and increased economies of scale.</p>
<p>The USU is the only Federal health sciences university and we are committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war.  We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and with scientists who serve the common good.  We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness.  USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda. Additional information regarding USU and its mission can be found on our website: www.usuhs.mil.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotes (RFQ) for commercial items in accordance with the procedures of FAR part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, including FAR subpart 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.  This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-85, effective December 4, 2015 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), effective November 30, 2015.</p>
<p>USU requires the awardee(s) to provide repair and maintenance service on our medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous instruments.  The number of annual preventive maintenance (PM) visits will vary with each unit of instrument according to manufacturer's guidelines.  This consolidation of our maintenance services is a new requirement for USU and there is no incumbent contractor currently providing this service.  However, we currently hold numerous annual purchase orders (POs) and option contracts with various vendors that maintain our instruments.  The details are included in the Equipment Pricing spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The Government's plan is to award multiple, ten-year, blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) with Time-and-Material (T&amp;M) and/or Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) pricing.  Firms are not required to offer service for every contract line item number (CLIN) nor are they required to offer both T&amp;M and FFP.  A single award is possible but considered unlikely.  The award decision on each type and model of equipment will be made individually based on best value and it is anticipated that some offerors will be selected for multiple CLINs.  Upon evaluation of all responsive quotes, if USU determines no offers are in the best interest of the Government for certain CLINs, we reserve the right not to award those lines.</p>
<p>The Government will decide the best agreement cost/price type(s) for the Government upon evaluation of all quotes for each item.  The Government may issue a BPA using both T&amp;M and FFP to the same awardee.  The Government reserves the right to determine the price/cost type, the duration of the agreement(s), and the number of agreements and awardees upon the Government's evaluation of all responsive quotes.  The Government's intent is to give strong consideration to T&amp;M offers to minimize unnecessary cost on those instruments that require little to no maintenance.  USU believes the Government will benefit from an overall cost savings from a T&amp;M pricing model.  However, in the future, if the Government subsequently determines that the FFP pricing is more advantageous for an individual CLIN, the pricing may be converted using the offered prices. To minimize confusion, the Government will limit conversion frequency to not more than once each year for each CLIN.</p>
<p>The agreement(s) will likely include all the medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous instruments listed in the Equipment Pricing spreadsheet [Section B].  This is an evolving list as USU acquires new instruments and retire aging instrument; therefore, the Government cannot guarantee 100% accuracy at the time of this RFQ posting.  Interested offerors, nonetheless, should assume that this spreadsheet is complete and accurate when developing their quotes.  Interested offerors must note that the instruments to be included in this agreement(s) may ultimately vary.  USU will also add new instruments and remove existing instrument as USU deems necessary before and after the award.  New equipment will be added to the BPA of the best offer awardee providing service to the same make and model or to similar or successor models of the same equipment.  The Government's desire is to amalgamate as many service requirements into smallest number of agreement(s) to simplify administration.  However, USU intends to make the award decision for each instrument separately and recognizes that many split awards are possible; hence, the administrative effort will be a consideration in choosing awardees.</p>
<p>This requirement is not set aside for small business concerns.  The applicable Federal Supply Code (FSC) is J066 Maintenance, Maintenance and Repair of Instruments and Laboratory Equipment.  In order to be eligible for award, offerors must be registered on SAM.gov with completed Representations &amp; Certifications (Reps &amp; Certs).</p>
<p>The Secretary of Labor has exempted from the Service Contract Labor Standards statute those contracts and subcontracts in which the primary purpose is to furnish maintenance, calibration, or repair of scientific equipment and medical apparatus or equipment.  In order to be exempt, interested offerors must correctly certify and submit the attached Required Provisions document in the quote submission, including 52.222-48 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</p>
<p>C.2 Statement of Work:</p>
<p>C.2.1 Minimum Requirements:</p>
<p>Offerors responding to this solicitation must, at a minimum, meet the requirements listed below.  Quotes that do not meet the following minimum requirements will be deemed non-responsive and will not be considered for award:<br />C.2.1.1.	Offerors must be able to offer multiple years of required service (ideally for ten years) for at least one of our medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous instruments;<br />C.2.1.2.	Offerors must propose time-and-material (T&amp;M) and/or firm-fixed-price (FFP) offers;<br />C.2.1.3.	Offerors must be able to provide service in accordance with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications and operability;<br />C.2.1.4.	Offerors must be able to quickly address the Government's concerns and rectify all issues in a timely manner;<br />C.2.1.5.	Offerors must have at least two years of experience in directly or indirectly servicing major medical, laboratory, and/or other miscellaneous equipment;<br />C.2.1.6.	Offerors must have a clear, detailed plan on how they plan on fulfilling our service needs and how they address to complaints;<br />C.2.1.7.	Offerors must have all personnel who can obtain base access;<br />C.2.1.8.	If an offeror is planning to work with subcontractors, the offeror must be able to coordinate all aspects of the maintenance, including the service and payment, with no involvement of the Government; and<br />C.2.1.9.	Offerors must keep a detailed log of all services scheduled and performed.</p>
<p>These are firm requirements and not the only requirements.  Additional requirements are detailed below and in the M. Evaluation Factors for Award section.  Offerors must be able to satisfy the requirements detailed in this solicitation for award consideration.</p>
<p>C.2.2. Scope of Work:</p>
<p>Awardee(s) shall provide unlimited emergency (remedial) repairs when required on all awarded items listed in the Equipment Pricing spreadsheet.  Based on the Government's evaluation, we will determine the best value awardees for certain brand and/or type of instruments.  As our needs change, USU will add or delete service requirements from existing BPAs using agreed-upon pricing method.  Awardee(s) must provide all labor, parts, materials, tools, transportation, and management necessary to fulfill our service requirements.  All work must be completed in accordance with the OEMs' specifications.</p>
<p>Awardee(s) shall perform PMs in accordance with the OEMs' recommendations during the period of performance (PoP).  USU will not accept PM-only offers on any of our instruments.  Awardee(s) must track and initiate all PM visits.  Awardee(s) shall not assume the Government will request or remind when PMs are due.  Awardee(s) must provide all labor, parts, software, materials, tools, transportation, and management necessary to fulfill our service requirements.  All work must be completed in accordance with the OEMs' specifications and operability.</p>
<p>Awardee(s) must provide technical, application, and operational support to Government personnel on an as-needed basis via phone, on-site, or other means.</p>
<p>USU must be able to place an unlimited number of service calls with the awardee(s).  USU requests that awardee(s) respond to all calls within one (1) business day (weekends and Government holidays excluded) and that all repairs be completed in accordance with the proposed time frame in the offeror's proposed timeline in Section B.  Interested offerors are invited to detail their own and USU hopes you will propose more aggressive response and repair timeframes in the quote which may become part of the award.  If an offeror provides faster or slower response and service depending on whether the award is on an FFP basis versus T&amp;M basis, it must detail the different response and repair times in the Equipment Pricing spreadsheet [Section B].  Failure to do so will result in the Government assuming that there is no difference between FFP and T&amp;M in respect to response and repair times.</p>
<p>USU asks the offerors to be accountable for delays or failure in providing timely service with self-proposed voluntary daily credit (a reimbursement to the Government for each day the awardee fails to repair beyond the promised repair time).  This credit will demonstrate the offeror's confidence in its ability to perform timely and effectively.  This information will be considered as part of the Technical and Awardee Accountability evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Awardee(s) must be able to provide service during the Government's normal business hours (Monday through Friday, Federal holidays excluded, from 7:30am ET (0730 hours) to 4:00pm ET (1600 hours).  In some instances, the Government may request emergency repairs outside the normal business hours.  If available, such service will be incorporated into the agreement.</p>
<p>USU would like to be able to speak directly with the service provider (usually the OEM) to troubleshoot over the phone.  This is to resolve simple, minor inquiries and concerns.  It is also to streamline the service call process and to better explain our issue to the party who best understands the equipment.</p>
<p>The Government highly recommends the awardees perform an initial inspection on all their awarded instruments as they enter into coverage to confirm that they are in accordance with OEM specifications and operability.  After the first inspection, the Government will expect the awardees to perform strictly to OEM specifications and operability.  Failure to do so may result in cancellation of the BPA and poor performance reviews for future Government contracts/agreements.</p>
<p>USU, particularly AFRRI, have irradiators that must be serviced per the NRC Guidelines.  Most of these irradiators are "hardened" machines that are set in place and may be difficult to service.  Awardees must take care when servicing such instruments.  The awardees are fully responsible for all damages to the Government's property.</p>
<p>All awardee-supplied test equipment used to service the instruments must be NIST certified.  All work must be performed in accordance with Federal, state, and local regulations.</p>
<p>An awardee shall not consider this as a requirements contract.  The Government reserves the right to utilize other sources if deemed in our best interest.</p>
<p>C.2.3 Documentation of Services:</p>
<p>The request for service, except PMs, will be made by the USU Technical Service Branch (TSB) usually via a service call or an email request.  On some occasions, a research end-user (customer) will dial a three-way conference call among the customer, USU TSB, and the awardee.  When TSB is not available for a conference call, the customer may make a direct service call with the awardee.  Whenever TSB does not initiate the service call, the USU customer who places the three-way or direct two-way calls must follow with an authorization email to USU TSB and the awardee with the subject line "[BPA number] Service Authorization."  For those service calls initiated by the customer, not TSB, the awardees must ensure that the customer has issued the authorization email to TSB before providing the necessary service.  USU TSB is the coordinating office for all service calls and may at times reject the customer's requests.</p>
<p>If a vendor proposes to charge for telephone consultations on a T&amp;M basis, an e-mail authorization must be generated by USU and a detailed field service report (FSR) must be issued by the awardee.  Upon completion of every service, awardee(s) must produce an electronic and/or hardcopy FSR and share a copy with USU TSB.  Only the FSRs will serve as the evidence of all services and PMs performed, including the duration and purpose of telephone consultations.  USU cannot and will not process payments until the awardee provides a complete FSR and a copy of the authorization e-mail.  Each report must include, at minimum:<br />2.2.1.1	The company and technician information, including contact number and email;<br />2.2.1.2	The duration and purpose of the call (if calls are separately charged under T&amp;M agreements);<br />2.2.1.3	The date and location of the service;<br />2.2.1.4	The description of the instrument (e.g. make, model, and serial number);<br />2.2.1.5	All work performed, including description and number of hours; and<br />2.2.1.6	All parts used, including pertinent catalog numbers.<br />2.2.1.7	Offerors shall indicate if their FSR includes signature of the user to indicate satisfaction with the work performed.</p>
<p>We require the awardee(s) to digitally maintain a detailed log of all service calls and work performed.  Ideally, we prefer the log to be kept in Microsoft Excel .xlsx file format.  This log must be updated with each service performed and the updated electronic copy must be emailed to the appropriate USU personnel-to be determined-after each service.  We will consider other forms of this electronic log offered by interested offerors.  This log must not be made public to anyone without an explicit consent by the USU TSB and the USU Acquisition Directorate (ACQ).  The following information must be logged at a minimum:<br />2.2.2.1	Award number;<br />2.2.2.2	Unique identification number for each service;<br />2.2.2.3	Date of service call;<br />2.2.2.4	Name of caller;<br />2.2.2.5	Description of the issue/concern;<br />2.2.2.6	Name of service provider (OEM/independent service provider (ISP)) and its technician(s) who serviced the instrument;<br />2.2.2.7	Date of service completed; and<br />2.2.2.8	Any follow-up and additional notes.</p>
<p>Once a year, USU will require the awardee(s) to sign and certify the Certificate of Conformance to Manufacturer's Specifications and Operability [see Section J].  If an instrument fails to meet the OEM specifications and operability, the awardee of the agreement will be required to fully pay for all costs associated with recertifying the instrument.</p>
<p>C.2.4 Standards of Workmanship:</p>
<p>The quality of all services and supplies rendered are critical to the validity and performance of research at USU and must conform to the highest standards in the relevant profession, trade, or field of endeavor.  All services and supplies will be provided directly by individuals fully qualified in the relevant profession, trade, or field and must hold all relevant licenses and/or certifications required by the industry as well as applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The awardee(s) must perform all services in accordance with the OEM's specifications and must provide all, if any, OEM system hardware, software, and firmware upgrades throughout the term of the award whenever released by the OEM, unless explicitly directed otherwise.  Accordingly, all work must result in the equipment performing to 100% OEM specifications.</p>
<p>C.2.5 Technical Service Qualifications:</p>
<p>All service technicians who will provide service to the equipment covered by this agreement must be OEM factory trained and certified or demonstrate equivalency.  All service technicians must maintain up-to-date knowledge and information regarding repair of and performance enhancements to the equipment per the OEM-issued technical bulletins.</p>
<p>C.2.6 Subcontracting:</p>
<p>Offerors are free to establish teaming and/or subcontracting relations with other companies.  The prime awardee must maintain a positive working relationship with all subcontractors to minimize performance risks to the Government.</p>
<p>C.2.7 Software/Firmware Upgrades:</p>
<p>Some instruments will require software/firmware upgrades in accordance with the OEM's release and instructions.  All upgrades must be coordinated with USU Network Operations and Communications Directorate (NOC) before deployment.  Further instructions for software/firmware approval will be provided on as-needed basis.</p>
<p>C.2.8 Lockout/Tagout (LOTO):</p>
<p>Energy sources including electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical, thermal, or other sources in machines and equipment can be hazardous to workers.  To prevent accidents, awardees must adhere to their proper lockout/tagout (LOTO) practice and guidelines.  Awardees must also be proactive in training its employees of their LOTO procedures.</p>
<p>Awardees are fully responsible for all accidents and damages resulting from their negligence or noncompliance to its LOTO procedures.</p>
<p>C.2.9 BPA Calls:</p>
<p>USU TSB is the division within the USU Logistics (LOG) Department that will handle all service needs.  When a service need arises, the USU department that owns the instrument will call TSB for them to unilaterally initiate a service call with the awardee.  Sometimes, the customer from the department with the service need will call the awardee directly for a three-way conference call among the department, TSB, and the awardee.  This is to ensure that TSB is aware of may service requirements at USU.  If TSB is unavailable for the conference call, the department will call the awardee directly.  In either case, if a customer outside of TSB places the call, she/he must always follow the call with an authorization email of the details of the conversation to TSB and to the awardee.  The awardee must not perform service prior to receiving this email from the customer to TSB and to the awardee.</p>
<p>In the BPA, we may define a list of authorized callers who may place the service calls and make payments.  The authorized callers will consist mainly of select Government representatives from USU TSB and various USU departments.  This list will be maintain internally by the USU ACQ.  Only a contracting officer has the authority to modify this list.  This list will not be incorporated into the BPA and an updated list will be provided to the awardees on an as-needed basis.  This list will surely evolve over time.  Once the awardee agrees to provide the service by scheduling a visit, all BPA calls are binding and all terms and conditions of the agreement must be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The dollar limitation for each individual purchase under the BPA shall not exceed $50,000.00.</p>
<p>The Government is only obligated for authorized purchases made under the BPA.</p>
<p>C.2.10 Addition or Deletion of Instruments:</p>
<p>The agreement may be modified by the Government with a written notice to add or delete items or to on a pro-rated or T&amp;M basis.</p>
<p>Over time, USU will acquire new instruments.  Based on this solicitation evaluation, USU will determine those vendors best suited to service certain model instruments.  For the full agreement duration, new instruments most likely be added to those best-value awardees with a positive performance history for the identical or similar models.  However, this is not a requirements contract.  The Government may seek other procurement options.  We may decide to compete the new service requirement among all interested offerors in the market to add to an existing BPA or to award a new BPA.</p>
<p>Awardees may request an inspection of the new instruments.  If the prices have not been established for the same brand and model in the initial agreement, the Government will consider new fair and reasonable T&amp;M and/or FFP proposed pricing from the awardee.  Offerors are encouraged to discuss future pricing strategies.</p>
<p>USU will also decommission aging instruments over time.  The Government will provide this information in writing to the appropriate awardee for removal.  The removal will take effect from the date of this notice from the Government.</p>
<p>Addition and deletion of instruments will not affect the T&amp;M CLINs.  For FFP CLINs, the cost for the coverage shall be prorated based on the number of months the instrument is actually covered under the agreement.  The instrument must have been covered for at least 15 calendar days of the month for payment.  If an instrument was covered for less than 15 days, we will pay based on prorated daily rate.</p>
<p>C.2.11 Relocation Services:</p>
<p>On occasions, USU may require a relocation service of an instrument.  This service includes uninstalling, moving, reinstalling, and recalibrating.  Offerors are encouraged to offer such service if available.  If prices are indeterminable at the time of quote, offerors must detail their established pricing practice on how they will provide the best prices to the Government.</p>
<p>C.2.12 Offsite Repairs:</p>
<p>Offerors must indicate those instruments that must be shipped offsite of USU for repairs.  Offerors must also detail the logistics of shipment, any special instructions, and the billing rate for transporting the instrument.  Offeror assumes liability for any damages occurring during shipment or while being serviced offsite.</p>
<p>C.2.13 Customer Dissatisfaction:</p>
<p>Should a customer express any dissatisfaction with the services rendered by an awardee or about the performance and condition of an item after having been services, the customer will formally express her/his dissatisfaction in writing to USU TSB.  USU TSB will review all written complaints for validity and forward its comments to the contracting officer if deemed appropriate.  The contracting officer will then contact the awardee and forward the written complaint with a request for response.  Awardees must respond to the written complaint and resolve the situation within two business days.</p>
<p>C.2.14 Cancellation of BPA:</p>
<p>To avoid adversely affecting the Government's mission, the awardee must submit its BPA cancellation request in writing to the appropriate contracting officer at least 90 days in advance.</p>
<p>C.2.15 Invoices and Payments:</p>
<p>The Government will make the payments for each call in arrears not more often than monthly.  Contract financing will not be authorized for this requirement.  Awardee(s) must submit a complete summary invoice for the BPA to the appropriate Government officials per the FAR 52.212-4(g) Invoices and the agreement.  Charges for other orders must be submitted on separate invoices.</p>
<p>For both T&amp;M and FFP CLINs, the Government will make single monthly payment.  The awardees must submit a complete invoice itemizing all charges for the month to USU TSB.  The Government will not process the payment without an FSR, the authorizing e-mail and an invoice to the USU TSB.  All payments will be made in arrears.</p>
<p>All payments will be made using Visa Governmental Purchase Card (GPC).  Electronic funds transfer (EFT) as a form of payment will not be authorized for this BPA.</p>
<p>C.2.16 Base access and Parking:</p>
<p>Awardee(s) must ensure that its personnel are able to obtain US military base access.  Refer to the base access instructions in the following site:<br />http://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrsw/installations/navbase_coronado/om/force_protection/base_access.html</p>
<p>Awardees are highly encourage to enroll in the long-term RAPIDGate pre-vetted base access.  Delayed or failure to perform due to awardee's negligence in ensuring base access will not be permitted as an excusable delay.</p>
<p>The detailed parking instructions will be provided at a later date.</p>
<p>C.2.17 Misuse and Abuse:</p>
<p>Service and parts required due to misuse, abuse, or damage due to external causes beyond the control of the awardee may not be the responsibility of the awardee.   The awardee shall furnish the details of possible misuse to TSB within three business days.  USU TSB shall determine the appropriateness of additional payment and any unresolved disputes will be forwarded to the contracting officer for final determination.</p>
<p>C.2.18 Required DoD Manpower Reporting:</p>
<p>Awardees shall report all labor hours, including subcontractor labor hours, required for performance of services provided under this agreement via a secure data collection site. The awardees are required to completely fill in all required data fields using the following web address: http://www.ecmra.mil/.</p>
<p>The reporting inputs will be for the labor executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs October 1 through September 30.  While inputs may be reported any time during the FY, all data shall be reported no later than 31 October for the period of performance of the preceding fiscal year.  Awardees may direct questions to the help desk at help desk at: http://www.ecmra.mil/.&emsp;</p>

<p>L.3 In-Person Oral Presentation:</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to request an in-person oral presentation as deemed fit.  If oral presentations are requested by the Government, the company must consent to recording the presentation.  The date and location of the presentation will be discussed and determined at a later date.&emsp;</p>
<p>M. Evaluation Factors for Award</p>
<p>The Government will award to the responsible vendor(s) whose offer, conforming to this announcement, will be most advantageous to the Government based on best value trade-offs.</p>
<p>The Government is not required to award to the lowest-priced offeror or to the highest technically-rated offeror.  Award(s) will be made to the offeror(s) whose quote(s) is/are technically acceptable and whose Past Performance, Awardee Accountability, Corporate Experience, and Price are the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p>The Government may reject any quotes that have been determined to be unrealistic in terms of price when compared to the Government cost estimate, market research, and other offers.  A quote may also be rejected if the offeror does not display a clear understanding of the requirements or the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>All non-Price evaluation factors when combined are more important than Price.  But as the non-Price evaluation factors are rated more equally among the technically-acceptable offers, the importance of Price will increase.</p>
<p>Evaluation factors are listed in the order of importance, with the most important being listed first:<br />3.1.	Technical,<br />3.2.	Past Performance<br />3.3.	Corporate Experience,<br />3.4.	Awardee Accountability, and<br />3.5.	Price.</p>
<p>M.1 Technical:</p>
<p>Offerors must describe their technical approach and provide evidence to demonstrate the following:<br />M.1.1.	Provide and certify maintenance service in accordance with the OEM specifications and operability;<br />M.1.2.	Provide PMs and/or software updates as described in the Equipment Pricing attachment;<br />M.1.3.	Available during the Government's normal business hours (Monday through Friday, Federal holidays excluded, from 7:30am ET (0730 hours) to 4:00pm ET (1600 hours));<br />M.1.4.	Sometimes the Government may require service outside the normal business hours listed in M.1.3.  If such service is available, the quote must include the terms, conditions, and the prices for such repairs;<br />M.1.5.	Disclose whether or not a direct access to the service provider (usually the OEM) is available to USU.  If not, please propose how you plan to resolve simple, minor inquiries or concerns;<br />M.1.6.	Offer guaranteed response and repair time, including any contingencies;<br />M.1.7.	Issue field service report (FSR) to USU TSB  upon each call and service visit;<br />M.1.8.	Maintain a secure digital log of all services;<br />M.1.9.	Hold all relevant licenses and/or certifications required by the industry as well as applicable laws and regulations;<br />M.1.10.	Offer customer- and industry-relations plan as well as letters of commitment from subcontractors to maintain and improve ongoing relationships to ensure satisfactory performance;<br />M.1.11.	Propose innovative solutions to satisfy the Government's service requirements that we may not have yet considered;<br />M.1.12.	Define all teaming and/or subcontracting plans.  Letters of Commitment from the subcontractors will be evaluated favorably;<br />M.1.13.	Detail how often the software/firmware upgrades will be deployed and how it will be implemented for those applicable instruments;<br />M.1.14.	Detail the proper lockout/tagout (LOTO) practice and guidelines as well as its training plans of its employees.</p>
<p>Those technical quotes that best fulfills our requirements and most aptly addresses our existing and potential future risks will be rated higher.</p>
<p>M.2 Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government shall evaluate the offerors' present and past performance references.  Offerors must provide three (3) contract/award numbers with Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) reports for similar work performed.  Copies of the entire CPARS evaluation must be provided in the quote package.</p>
<p>If CPARS reports are not available, offerors must provide three (3) references with which the offeror has had performance history in similar complexity and scope as the USU requirement.  The Government reserves the right to select which references to contact.  The following should be provided for each reference:<br />M.2.1.	Name of agency and/or business;<br />M.2.2.	The address of the agency and/or business;<br />M.2.3.	Name of current point-of-contact, including title, phone number, and email address;<br />M.2.4.	Contract/agreement number;<br />M.2.5.	Contract/agreement value;<br />M.2.6.	Contract/agreement period of performance; and<br />M.2.7.	Brief description of the service(s) provided.</p>
<p>The three past performance CPARS reports or references should include at least one internal USU CPARS report or reference if available.</p>
<p>More than three past performance CPARS reports or references will not be considered.  USU may request additional information at any time.</p>
<p>If there were any teaming/subcontracting efforts, the past performance contact must be of the prime entity.</p>
<p>Offerors will have an opportunity to timely address any adverse past performance history.  Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably; instead those offerors will be rated a Neutral/Unknown rating.  Offerors must clearly state in their quote if they do not have at least three past performance references.  Failure to address this information may render an offeror's quote nonresponsive and may not be considered for award by the Government.</p>
<p>A history of relevant strong past performance will be more advantageous to the offeror than a less relevant record of strong performance.  The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternative sources in conducting our assessment of past performance history.</p>
<p>M.3 Corporate Experience:</p>
<p>Offerors must provide a narrative of their experience in providing the same or similar type and complexity of services requested.  In addition, offerors must also describe the following experience:<br />M.3.1.	Experience in providing maintenance services or maintenance management services, including with different types of entity, e.g. Federal Government, state and local government, private companies, hospitals, universities, etc.;<br />M.3.2.	Experience in facilitating emergency service requests and dealing with prolonged, difficult maintenance services;<br />M.3.3.	Experience in executing difference types of Federal Government contracts/agreements, especially FFP and T&amp;M contracts/agreements; and<br />M.3.4.	Experience in servicing various types and brands of equipment.  Offerors should list all the equipment they are able to service.</p>
<p>Those offerors with rich history of related corporate experience will be rated higher.</p>
<p>M.4 Awardee Accountability:</p>
<p>The Government requests the awardee(s) to be accountable of the services they promise to provide.  Offerors must present its quote in good faith and must offer a plan in case the Government receives delayed or unsatisfactory service.  Offerors must present realistic response and repair times.  Offerors may opt to offer voluntary daily credit for delays or failure to render promised services.  These factors will be reflected in this evaluation.  Offerors must detail all contingencies to this plan as they deem necessary.</p>
<p>M.5 Price:</p>
<p>Interested offerors must complete the Equipment Pricing attachment and submit an electronic copy for award consideration.</p>
<p>Offered prices must include all pertinent cost, including but not limited to parts, labor, travel, and profit.  The total price will be the evaluated price.  Interest offerors are encouraged to offer both FFP and T&amp;M prices for each line of equipment they propose to maintain.  Offers that provide only FFP or T&amp;M prices, but not both, will be considered without prejudice.  Ultimately, the resulting award(s) could contain both FFP and T&amp;M prices for different CLINs.</p>
<p>For T&amp;M pricing, offerors must offer every facet of cost; including how PMs, software/firmware updates, and addition of new instruments will be priced.</p>
<p>USU recognizes that these are commercial services and future fixed prices or labor rates are uncertain; therefore, offerors are encouraged to provide proposed future price adjustment formulas.  It would be wise to peg these formula to your best customer pricing and to explain the deviations from that price, e.g. Government/university discounts.  The proposed price adjustment interval will also be evaluated.</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for repair and maintenance of most of the equipment at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU or the Government) and Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, which falls under USU.  Hereby the term "USU" and "the Government" refers to instruments at both installations in Bethesda, MD.  Section B, the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet, is an attachment.  The Government plans to issue time-and-material (T&amp;M) and/or firm-fixed price (FFP) blanket purchase agreement(s) (BPAs) to maximize the cost savings to the Government.  Please read the entire solicitation to understand the procurement process before completing this Excel document.  We strongly encourage you to ask timely questions if issues are unclear.  All questions will be answered with an amendment to this request for quotes (RFQ).&emsp;<br />B. Pricing</p>
<p>Refer to the attached HU0001-16-Q-0001 Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet (.xlsx file).  Offerors must complete and submit this electronic document for award consideration.  Please note the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet has two sheets within the file: One for equipment information and one for pricing sheet.&emsp;<br />C. Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>C.1 General Overview:</p>
<p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU or the Government) and Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, which fall under USU, located in Bethesda, MD, has a requirement to streamline our medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous equipment service procurements.  Historically, USU has issued individual purchase orders for each piece of equipment.  This solicitation will secure these services for nearly all equipment using awards that are designed to reduce administration, reduce down time, and maximize cost savings through reduced administrative costs and increased economies of scale.</p>
<p>The USU is the only Federal health sciences university and we are committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war.  We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and with scientists who serve the common good.  We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness.  USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda. Additional information regarding USU and its mission can be found on our website: www.usuhs.mil.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotes (RFQ) for commercial items in accordance with the procedures of FAR part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, including FAR subpart 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.  This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-85, effective December 4, 2015 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), effective November 30, 2015.</p>
<p>USU requires the awardee(s) to provide repair and maintenance service on our medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous instruments.  The number of annual preventive maintenance (PM) visits will vary with each unit of instrument according to manufacturer's guidelines.  This consolidation of our maintenance services is a new requirement for USU and there is no incumbent contractor currently providing this service.  However, we currently hold numerous annual purchase orders (POs) and option contracts with various vendors that maintain our instruments.  The details are included in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The Government's plan is to award multiple, ten-year, blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) with Time-and-Material (T&amp;M) and/or Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) pricing.  Offerors may offer service for only those instruments they are capable and are interested in maintaining; you are not required to submit an offer for every contract line item number (CLIN).  You are also neither required to offer both T&amp;M and FFP nor all ten years of service.  A single award is possible but considered unlikely.  The award decision on each type and model of equipment will be made individually based on best value and it is anticipated that some offerors will be selected for multiple CLINs.  Upon evaluation of all responsive quotes, if USU determines no offers are in the best interest of the Government for certain CLINs, we reserve the right not to award those lines.</p>
<p>The Government will decide the best agreement cost/price type(s) for the Government upon evaluation of all quotes for each item.  The Government may issue a BPA using both T&amp;M and FFP to the same awardee.  The Government reserves the right to determine the price/cost type, the duration of the agreement(s), and the number of agreements and awardees upon the Government's evaluation of all responsive quotes.  The Government's intent is to give strong consideration to T&amp;M offers to minimize unnecessary cost on those instruments that require little to no maintenance.  USU believes the Government will benefit from an overall cost savings from a T&amp;M pricing model.  However, in the future, if the Government subsequently determines that the FFP pricing is more advantageous for an individual CLIN, the pricing may be converted using the offered prices. To minimize confusion, the Government will limit conversion frequency to not more than once each year for each CLIN.  Offerors should define their terms and conditions in their quotes.  Those offerors quoting both FFP and T&amp;M pricings must clearly indicate in their quotes whether there will be any difference to the service in terms of response time and repair time, i.e. T&amp;M agreement will result in 5-day delay in servicing the instrument compared to FFP agreement.</p>
<p>The agreement(s) will likely include all the medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous instruments listed in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet [Section B].  This is an evolving list as USU acquires new instruments and retire aging instrument; therefore, the Government cannot guarantee 100% accuracy at the time of this RFQ posting.  Interested offerors, nonetheless, should assume that this spreadsheet is complete and accurate when developing their quotes.  Interested offerors must note that the instruments to be included in this agreement(s) may ultimately vary.  USU will also add new instruments and remove existing instrument as USU deems necessary before and after the award.  New equipment will be added to the BPA of the best offer awardee providing service to the same make and model or to similar or successor models of the same equipment.  The Government's desire is to amalgamate as many service requirements into smallest number of agreement(s) to simplify administration.  However, USU intends to make the award decision for each instrument separately and recognizes that many split awards are possible; hence, the administrative effort will be a consideration in choosing awardees.</p>
<p>This requirement is not set aside for small business concerns.  The applicable Federal Supply Code (FSC) is J066 Maintenance, Maintenance and Repair of Instruments and Laboratory Equipment.  In order to be eligible for award, offerors must be registered on SAM.gov with completed Representations &amp; Certifications (Reps &amp; Certs).</p>
<p>The Secretary of Labor has exempted from the Service Contract Labor Standards statute those contracts and subcontracts in which the primary purpose is to furnish maintenance, calibration, or repair of scientific equipment and medical apparatus or equipment.  In order to be exempt, interested offerors must correctly certify and submit the attached Required Provisions document in the quote submission, including 52.222-48 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</p>
<p>C.2 Statement of Work:</p>
<p>C.2.1 Desired Requirements:</p>
<p>Offerors responding to this solicitation should, at a minimum, meet the requirements listed below.  Offers that do not meet the following will be deemed less technically capable than those offers that do meet the following requirements:<br />C.2.1.1.	Offerors must be able to offer multiple years of required service (ideally for ten years) for at least one of our medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous instruments;<br />C.2.1.2.	Offerors must propose time-and-material (T&amp;M) and/or firm-fixed-price (FFP) offers;<br />C.2.1.3.	Offerors must be able to provide service in accordance with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications and operability;<br />C.2.1.4.	Offerors must be able to quickly address the Government's concerns and rectify all issues in a timely manner;<br />C.2.1.5.	Offerors must have at least two years of experience in directly or indirectly servicing major medical, laboratory, and/or other miscellaneous equipment;<br />C.2.1.6.	Offerors must have a clear, detailed plan on how they plan on fulfilling our service needs and how they address to complaints;<br />C.2.1.7.	Offerors must have all personnel who can obtain base access;<br />C.2.1.8.	Offerors must be able to present consolidated monthly invoices for monthly lump-sum payments of all instruments with the awardee;<br />C.2.1.9.	If an offeror is planning to work with subcontractors, the offeror must be able to coordinate all aspects of the maintenance, including the service and payment, with no involvement of the Government; and<br />C.2.1.10.	Every service must be substantiated with a detailed field service report (FSR), which must be given to appropriate USU representative(s) upon completion of all service.  Offerors must also keep a detailed log of all services scheduled and performed.</p>
<p>These are not the only requirements.  Additional requirements are detailed below and in the M. Evaluation Factors for Award section.</p>
<p>C.2.2. Scope of Work:</p>
<p>Awardee(s) shall provide unlimited emergency (remedial) repairs when required on all awarded items listed in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet.  Based on the Government's evaluation, we will determine the best value awardees for certain brand and/or type of instruments.  As our needs change, USU will add or delete service requirements from existing BPAs with the previously determined best-value awardees.  Awardee(s) must provide all labor, parts, materials, tools, transportation, and management necessary to fulfill our service requirements.  All work must be completed in accordance with the OEMs' specifications.</p>
<p>Awardee(s) shall perform PMs in accordance with the OEMs' recommendations during the period of performance (PoP).  USU will not accept PM-only offers on any of our instruments.  Awardee(s) must track and initiate all PM visits.  Awardee(s) shall not assume the Government will request or remind when PMs are due.  Awardee(s) must provide all labor, parts, software, materials, tools, transportation, and management necessary to fulfill our service requirements.  All work must be completed in accordance with the OEMs' specifications and operability.</p>
<p>Awardee(s) must provide technical, application, and operational support to Government personnel on an as-needed basis via phone, on-site, or other means.</p>
<p>USU must be able to place an unlimited number of service calls with the awardee(s).  USU requests that awardee(s) respond to all calls as soon as possible (ideally within one (1) business day (weekends and Government holidays excluded)) and that all repairs be completed in accordance with the proposed time frame in the offeror's proposed timeline in Section B.  Interested offerors are invited to detail their own timelines.  If the pricing type (FFP versus T&amp;M) will affect how quickly the awardee will respond/repair, such information must be disclosed in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet [Section B].  Failure to do so will result in the Government assuming that there is no difference between FFP and T&amp;M in respect to response and repair times.</p>
<p>USU asks the offerors to be accountable for delays or failure in providing timely service with self-proposed voluntary daily credit (a reimbursement to the Government for each day the awardee fails to repair beyond the promised repair time).  This credit will demonstrate the offeror's confidence in its ability to perform timely and effectively.  This information will be considered as part of the Technical and Awardee Accountability evaluation factors.  Offerors may choose not to propose a credit.  However, those offerors who do propose a credit may be rated more favorably.</p>
<p>Awardee(s) must be able to provide service during the Government's normal business hours (Monday through Friday, Federal holidays excluded, from 7:30am ET (0730 hours) to 4:00pm ET (1600 hours).  In some instances, the Government may request emergency repairs outside the normal business hours.  If available, such service will be incorporated into the agreement.</p>
<p>USU would like to be able to speak directly with the service provider (usually the OEM) to troubleshoot over the phone.  This is to resolve simple, minor inquiries and concerns.  It is also to streamline the service call process and to better explain our issue to the party who best understands the equipment.</p>
<p>The Government strongly recommends the awardees perform an initial inspection on all their awarded instruments during the first service or PM visit to ensure the units are operating in accordance with the OEM specifications and operability.  The Government will consider separate charges to recertify deficient instruments as deemed necessary.  After the first inspection, the Government will expect the awardees to perform strictly to OEM specifications and operability.  Failure to do so may result in cancellation of the BPA and poor performance reviews for future Government contracts/agreements.</p>
<p>USU have irradiators that must be serviced per the NRC Guidelines.  Most of these irradiators are "hardened" machines that are set in place and may be difficult to service.  Awardees must take care when servicing such instruments.  The awardees are fully responsible for all damages.</p>
<p>All awardee-supplied test equipment used to service the instruments must be NIST certified.  All work must be performed in accordance with Federal, state, and local regulations.</p>
<p>An awardee shall not consider this as a requirements contract.  The Government reserves the right to utilize other sources if deemed in our best interest.</p>
<p>C.2.3 Documentation of Services:</p>
<p>The request for service, except PMs, will be made by the USU Technical Service Branch (TSB) usually via a service call or an email request.  On some occasions, a research end-user (customer) will dial a three-way conference call among the customer, USU TSB, and the awardee.  When TSB is not available for a conference call, the customer may make a direct service call with the awardee.  Whenever TSB does not initiate the service call, the USU customer who places the three-way or direct two-way calls must follow with an authorization email to USU TSB and the awardee with the subject line "[BPA number] Service Authorization."  For those service calls initiated by the customer, not TSB, the awardees must ensure that the customer has issued the authorization email to TSB before providing the necessary service.  USU TSB is the coordinating office for all service calls and may at times reject the customer's requests.</p>
<p>If a vendor proposes to charge for telephone consultations on a T&amp;M basis, an e-mail authorization must be generated by USU and a detailed field service report (FSR) must be issued by the awardee.  Upon completion of every service, awardee(s) must produce an electronic and/or hardcopy FSR and share a copy with USU TSB.  Only the FSRs will serve as the evidence of all services and PMs performed, including the duration and purpose of telephone consultations.  USU cannot and will not process payments until the awardee provides a complete FSR and a copy of the authorization e-mail.  Each report must include, at minimum:<br />2.2.1.1	The company and technician information, including contact number and email;<br />2.2.1.2	The duration and purpose of the call (if calls are separately charged under T&amp;M agreements);<br />2.2.1.3	The date and location of the service;<br />2.2.1.4	The description of the instrument (e.g. make, model, and serial number);<br />2.2.1.5	All work performed, including description and number of hours; and<br />2.2.1.6	All parts used, including pertinent catalog numbers.<br />2.2.1.7	Offerors shall indicate if their FSR includes signature of the user to indicate satisfaction with the work performed.</p>
<p>We require the awardee(s) to digitally maintain a detailed log of all service calls and work performed.  Ideally, we prefer the log to be kept in Microsoft Excel .xlsx file format.  This log must be updated with each service performed and the updated electronic copy must be emailed to the appropriate USU personnel-to be determined-after each service.  We will consider other forms of this electronic log offered by interested offerors.  This log must not be made public to anyone without an explicit consent by the USU TSB and the USU Acquisition Directorate (ACQ).  The following information must be logged at a minimum:<br />2.2.2.1	Award number;<br />2.2.2.2	Unique identification number for each service;<br />2.2.2.3	Date of service call;<br />2.2.2.4	Name of caller;<br />2.2.2.5	Description of the issue/concern;<br />2.2.2.6	Name of service provider (OEM/independent service provider (ISP)) and its technician(s) who serviced the instrument;<br />2.2.2.7	Date of service completed; and<br />2.2.2.8	Any follow-up and additional notes.</p>
<p>Once a year, USU will require the awardee(s) to sign and certify the Certificate of Conformance to Manufacturer's Specifications and Operability [see Section J].  If an instrument fails to meet the OEM specifications and operability, the awardee of the agreement will be required to fully pay for all costs associated with recertifying the instrument.</p>
<p>This documentation requirement is applicable for all awardees regardless of the pricing method.</p>
<p>C.2.4 Standards of Workmanship:</p>
<p>The quality of all services and supplies rendered are critical to the validity and performance of research at USU and must conform to the highest standards in the relevant profession, trade, or field of endeavor.  All services and supplies will be provided directly by individuals fully qualified in the relevant profession, trade, or field and must hold all relevant licenses and/or certifications required by the industry as well as applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The awardee(s) must perform all services in accordance with the OEM's specifications and must provide all, if any, OEM system hardware, software, and firmware updates throughout the term of the award whenever released by the OEM, unless explicitly directed otherwise.  Accordingly, all work must result in the equipment performing to 100% OEM specifications.</p>
<p>C.2.5 Technical Service Qualifications:</p>
<p>All service technicians who will provide service to the equipment covered by this agreement must be OEM factory trained and certified or demonstrate equivalency.  All service technicians must maintain up-to-date knowledge and information regarding repair of and performance enhancements to the equipment per the OEM-issued technical bulletins.</p>
<p>C.2.6 Subcontracting:</p>
<p>Offerors are free to establish teaming and/or subcontracting relations with other companies.  The prime awardee must maintain a positive working relationship with all subcontractors to minimize performance risks to the Government.</p>
<p>C.2.7 Software/Firmware Updates:</p>
<p>Some instruments will require software/firmware updates in accordance with the OEM's release and instructions.  All updates must be coordinated with USU Network Operations and Communications Directorate (NOC) before deployment.  Further instructions for software/firmware approval will be provided on as-needed basis.</p>
<p>Offerors should note (1) if the software/firmware updates are likely to be issued by the OEM for each piece of instrument, (2) if you will provide such updates, and (3) if there will be an additional charge.</p>
<p>C.2.8 Lockout/Tagout (LOTO):</p>
<p>Energy sources including electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical, thermal, or other sources in machines and equipment can be hazardous to workers.  To prevent accidents, awardees must adhere to their proper lockout/tagout (LOTO) practice and guidelines.  Awardees must also be proactive in training its employees of their LOTO procedures.</p>
<p>Awardees are fully responsible for all accidents and damages resulting from their negligence or noncompliance to its LOTO procedures.</p>
<p>C.2.9 BPA Calls:</p>
<p>USU TSB is the division within the USU Logistics (LOG) Department that will handle all service needs.  When a service need arises, the USU department that owns the instrument will call TSB for them to unilaterally initiate a service call with the awardee.  Sometimes, the customer from the department with the service need will call the awardee directly for a three-way conference call among the department, TSB, and the awardee.  This is to ensure that TSB is aware of may service requirements at USU.  If TSB is unavailable for the conference call, the department will call the awardee directly.  In either case, if a customer outside of TSB places the call, she/he must always follow the call with an authorization email of the details of the conversation to TSB and to the awardee.  The awardee must not perform service prior to receiving this email from the customer to TSB and to the awardee.</p>
<p>In the BPA, we may define a list of authorized callers who may place the service calls and make payments.  The authorized callers will consist mainly of select Government representatives from USU TSB and various USU departments.  This list will be maintain internally by the USU ACQ.  Only a contracting officer has the authority to modify this list.  This list will not be incorporated into the BPA and an updated list will be provided to the awardees on an as-needed basis.  This list will surely evolve over time.  Once the awardee agrees to provide the service by scheduling a visit, all BPA calls are binding and all terms and conditions of the agreement must be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The dollar limitation for each individual purchase under the BPA shall not exceed $50,000.00.</p>
<p>The Government is only obligated for authorized purchases made under the BPA.</p>
<p>C.2.10 Addition or Deletion of Instruments:</p>
<p>The agreement may be modified by the Government with a written notice to add or delete items or to on a pro-rated or T&amp;M basis.</p>
<p>Over time, USU will acquire new instruments.  Based on this solicitation evaluation, USU will determine those vendors best suited to service certain model instruments.  For the full agreement duration, new instruments most likely be added to those best-value awardees with a positive performance history for the identical or similar models.  However, this is not a requirements contract.  The Government may seek other procurement options.  We may decide to compete the new service requirement among all interested offerors in the market to add to an existing BPA or to award a new BPA.</p>
<p>Awardees may request an inspection of the new instruments.  If the prices have not been established for the same brand and model in the initial agreement, the Government will consider new fair and reasonable T&amp;M and/or FFP proposed pricing from the awardee.  Offerors are encouraged to discuss future pricing strategies.</p>
<p>USU will also decommission aging instruments over time.  The Government will provide this information in writing to the appropriate awardee for removal.  The removal will take effect from the date of this notice from the Government.</p>
<p>Addition and deletion of instruments will not affect the T&amp;M CLINs.  For FFP CLINs, the cost for the coverage shall be prorated based on the number of months the instrument is actually covered under the agreement.  The instrument must have been covered for at least 15 calendar days of the month for payment.  If an instrument was covered for less than 15 days, we will pay based on prorated daily rate.</p>
<p>C.2.11 Relocation Services:</p>
<p>On occasions, USU may require a relocation service of an instrument.  This service includes uninstalling, moving, reinstalling, and recalibrating.  Offerors are encouraged to offer such service if available.  If prices are indeterminable at the time of quote, offerors must detail their established pricing practice on how they will provide the best prices to the Government.</p>
<p>C.2.12 Offsite Repairs:</p>
<p>Offerors must indicate those instruments that must be shipped offsite of USU for repairs.  Offerors must also detail the logistics of shipment, any special instructions, and the billing rate for transporting the instrument.  Offeror assumes liability for any damages occurring during shipment or while being serviced offsite.</p>
<p>C.2.13 Customer Dissatisfaction:</p>
<p>Should a customer express any dissatisfaction with the services rendered by an awardee or about the performance and condition of an item after having been services, the customer will formally express her/his dissatisfaction in writing to USU TSB.  USU TSB will review all written complaints for validity and forward its comments to the contracting officer if deemed appropriate.  The contracting officer will then contact the awardee and forward the written complaint with a request for response.  Awardees must respond to the written complaint and resolve the situation within two business days.</p>
<p>C.2.14 Cancellation of BPA:</p>
<p>To avoid adversely affecting the Government's mission, the awardee must submit its BPA cancellation request in writing to the appropriate contracting officer at least 90 days in advance.</p>
<p>C.2.15 Invoices and Payments:</p>
<p>The Government will make the payments for each call in arrears not more often than monthly.  Contract financing will not be authorized for this requirement.  Awardee(s) must submit a complete summary invoice for the BPA to the appropriate Government officials per the FAR 52.212-4(g) Invoices and the agreement.  Charges for other orders must be submitted on separate invoices.</p>
<p>For both T&amp;M and FFP CLINs, the Government will make single monthly payment.  The awardees must submit a complete invoice itemizing all charges for the month to USU TSB.  The Government will not process the payment without an FSR, the authorizing e-mail and an invoice to the USU TSB.  All payments will be made in arrears.</p>
<p>All payments will be made using Visa Governmental Purchase Card (GPC).  Electronic funds transfer (EFT) as a form of payment will not be authorized for this BPA.</p>
<p>C.2.16 Base access and Parking:</p>
<p>Awardee(s) must ensure that its personnel are able to obtain US military base access.  Refer to the base access instructions in the following site:<br />http://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrsw/installations/navbase_coronado/om/force_protection/base_access.html</p>
<p>Awardees are highly encourage to enroll in the long-term RAPIDGate pre-vetted base access.  Delayed or failure to perform due to awardee's negligence in ensuring base access will not be permitted as an excusable delay.</p>
<p>The detailed parking instructions will be provided at a later date.</p>
<p>C.2.17 Misuse and Abuse:</p>
<p>Service and parts required due to misuse, abuse, or damage due to external causes beyond the control of the awardee may not be the responsibility of the awardee.   The awardee shall furnish the details of possible misuse to TSB within three business days.  USU TSB shall determine the appropriateness of additional payment and any unresolved disputes will be forwarded to the contracting officer for final determination.</p>
<p>C.2.18 Required DoD Manpower Reporting:</p>
<p>Awardees shall report all labor hours, including subcontractor labor hours, required for performance of services provided under this agreement via a secure data collection site. The awardees are required to completely fill in all required data fields using the following web address: http://www.ecmra.mil/.</p>
<p>The reporting inputs will be for the labor executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs October 1 through September 30.  While inputs may be reported any time during the FY, all data shall be reported no later than 31 October for the period of performance of the preceding fiscal year.

<p>L.3 In-Person Oral Presentation:</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to request an in-person oral presentation as deemed fit.  If oral presentations are requested by the Government, the company must consent to recording the presentation.  The date and location of the presentation will be discussed and determined at a later date.&emsp;<br />M. Evaluation Factors for Award</p>
<p>The Government will award to the responsible vendor(s) whose offer, conforming to this announcement, will be most advantageous to the Government based on best value trade-offs.</p>
<p>The Government is not required to award to the lowest-priced offeror or to the highest technically-rated offeror.  Award(s) will be made to the offeror(s) whose quote(s) is/are technically acceptable and whose Past Performance, Awardee Accountability, Corporate Experience, and Price are the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p>The Government may reject any quotes that have been determined to be unrealistic in terms of price when compared to the Government cost estimate, market research, and other offers.  A quote may also be rejected if the offeror does not display a clear understanding of the requirements or the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>All non-Price evaluation factors when combined are more important than Price.  But as the non-Price evaluation factors are rated more equally among the technically-acceptable offers, the importance of Price will increase.</p>
<p>Evaluation factors are listed in the order of importance, with the most important being listed first:<br />3.1.	Technical,<br />3.2.	Past Performance<br />3.3.	Corporate Experience,<br />3.4.	Awardee Accountability, and<br />3.5.	Price.</p>
<p>Offerors are permitted to submit their standard ("minimal") quote submission.  This standard quote would be a quote that a vendor would typically submit to its Government customers.  Upon the Government's evaluation, as we deem it necessary, we will open dialogues directly with the offerors.</p>
<p>M.1 Technical:</p>
<p>Offerors should, at minimum, describe their technical approach to fulfill the following:<br />M.1.1.	Provide and certify maintenance service in accordance with the OEM specifications and operability;<br />M.1.2.	Provide PMs and/or software updates, if applicable, as described in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 attachment;<br />M.1.3.	Available during the Government's normal business hours (Monday through Friday, Federal holidays excluded, from 7:30am ET (0730 hours) to 4:00pm ET (1600 hours));<br />M.1.4.	Sometimes the Government may require service outside the normal business hours listed in M.1.3.  If such service is available, the quote must include the terms, conditions, and the prices for such repairs;<br />M.1.5.	Disclose whether or not a direct telephone access to the service technician/provider is available to USU users.  If not, please propose how you plan to resolve simple, minor inquiries or concerns;<br />M.1.6.	Offer guaranteed response and repair time, including any contingencies;<br />M.1.7.	Issue field service report (FSR) to USU TSB  upon each call and service visit;<br />M.1.8.	Maintain a secure digital log of all services;<br />M.1.9.	Hold all relevant licenses and/or certifications required by the industry as well as applicable laws and regulations;<br />M.1.10.	Offer customer- and industry-relations plan as well as letters of commitment from subcontractors to maintain and improve ongoing relationships to ensure satisfactory performance;<br />M.1.11.	Propose innovative solutions to satisfy the Government's service requirements that we may not have yet considered;<br />M.1.12.	Define all teaming and/or subcontracting plans.  Letters of Commitment from the subcontractors will be evaluated favorably;<br />M.1.13.	Detail how often the software/firmware updates will be deployed and how it will be implemented for those applicable instruments;<br />M.1.14.	Detail the proper lockout/tagout (LOTO) practice and guidelines as well as its training plans of its employees.</p>
<p>Those technical quotes that best fulfills our requirements and most aptly addresses our existing and potential future risks will be rated higher.</p>
<p>M.2 Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government shall evaluate the offerors' present and past performance references.  Offerors must provide three (3) contract/award numbers with Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) reports for similar work performed.  Copies of the entire CPARS evaluation must be provided in the quote package.</p>
<p>If CPARS reports are not available, offerors must provide three (3) references with which the offeror has had performance history in similar complexity and scope as the USU requirement.  The Government reserves the right to select which references to contact.  The following should be provided for each reference:<br />M.2.1.	Name of agency and/or business;<br />M.2.2.	The address of the agency and/or business;<br />M.2.3.	Name of current point-of-contact, including title, phone number, and email address;<br />M.2.4.	Contract/agreement number;<br />M.2.5.	Contract/agreement value;<br />M.2.6.	Contract/agreement period of performance; and<br />M.2.7.	Brief description of the service(s) provided.</p>
<p>The three past performance CPARS reports or references should include at least one internal USU CPARS report or reference if available.</p>
<p>More than three past performance CPARS reports or references will not be considered.  USU may request additional information at any time.</p>
<p>If there were any teaming/subcontracting efforts, the past performance contact must be of the prime entity.</p>
<p>Offerors will have an opportunity to timely address any adverse past performance history.  Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably; instead those offerors will be rated a Neutral/Unknown rating.  Offerors must clearly state in their quote if they do not have at least three past performance references.  Failure to address this information may render an offeror's quote nonresponsive and may not be considered for award by the Government.</p>
<p>A history of relevant strong past performance will be more advantageous to the offeror than a less relevant record of strong performance.  The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternative sources in conducting our assessment of past performance history.</p>
<p>M.3 Corporate Experience:</p>
<p>Offerors must provide a narrative of their experience in providing the same or similar type and complexity of services requested.  In addition, offerors must also describe the following experience:<br />M.3.1.	Experience in providing maintenance services or maintenance management services, including with different types of entity, e.g. Federal Government, state and local government, private companies, hospitals, universities, etc.;<br />M.3.2.	Experience in facilitating emergency service requests and dealing with prolonged, difficult maintenance services;<br />M.3.3.	Experience in executing difference types of Federal Government contracts/agreements, especially FFP and T&amp;M contracts/agreements; and<br />M.3.4.	Experience in servicing various types and brands of equipment.  Offerors should list all the equipment they are able to service.</p>
<p>Those offerors with rich history of related corporate experience will be rated higher.</p>
<p>M.4 Awardee Accountability:</p>
<p>The Government requests the awardee(s) to be accountable of the services they promise to provide.  Offerors must present its quote in good faith and must offer a plan in case the Government receives delayed or unsatisfactory service.  Offerors must present realistic response and repair times.  Offerors may opt to offer voluntary daily credit for delays or failure to render promised services.  These factors will be reflected in this evaluation.  Offerors must detail all contingencies to this plan as they deem necessary.</p>
<p>M.5 Price:</p>
<p>Interested offerors must complete the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 attachment and submit an electronic copy for award consideration.</p>
<p>Offered prices must include all pertinent cost, including but not limited to parts, labor, travel, and profit.  The total price will be the evaluated price.  Interest offerors are encouraged to offer both FFP and T&amp;M prices for each line of equipment they propose to maintain.  Offers that provide only FFP or T&amp;M prices, but not both, will be considered without prejudice.  Ultimately, the resulting award(s) could contain both FFP and T&amp;M prices for different CLINs.</p>
<p>For T&amp;M pricing, offerors must offer every facet of cost; including how PMs, software/firmware updates, and addition of new instruments will be priced.</p>
<p>USU recognizes that these are commercial services and future fixed prices or labor rates are uncertain; therefore, offerors are encouraged to provide proposed future price adjustment formulas.  It would be wise to peg these formula to your best customer pricing and to explain the deviations from that price, e.g. Government/university discounts.  The proposed price adjustment interval will also be evaluated.</p>

<DESC><strong><em>*See attachments for complete detail<br /></em></strong><br />Uniformed Services University (USU)<br />Request for Quotes (RFQ)<br />HU0001-16-Q-0001<br />Amendment #2
<p>The purpose of Amendment #2 is to clarify the 16Q0001 Section B the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet.  This Amendment #2 does not change any information already provided in the Amendment #1; therefore, offerors must use the Amendment #1 attachments for their quote submission.  Offerors must note in their quotes that they acknowledge the Amendments #1 and #2.</p>
<p>The 16Q0001 Section B the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet attachment has limited columns (for both FFP pricing and T&amp;M pricing) for offerors to enter their offers.  USU understands offerors are planning on proposing multiple years of services (some are planning all ten years) and they are wondering how to enter each year's price in this Pricing spreadsheet.  Offerors should only list their first year's offer (FFP and/or T&amp;M prices) in this spreadsheet.  Your quote package should separately explain your adjustment method for the future years [see the last paragraph on page 21 of this 16Q0001 RFQ Amendment #2].  (All adjustment proposal must be substantiated upon USU's request to ensure the method is fair and reasonable.)</p>
<p>If an offeror wishes to propose a T&amp;M service but the hourly T&amp;M rates and the materials markups aren't currently available, it should clearly state so in the quote.  The offeror should then explain their past cost (T&amp;M) experience and detail how they plan to execute the T&amp;M service and how they plan to invoice the Government.  Offerors should present enough detail to allow the Government to evaluate all five factors listed in the Section M. Evaluation Factors for Award.<br />&emsp;<br />Uniformed Services University (USU)<br />Request for Quotes (RFQ)<br />HU0001-16-Q-0001<br />Amendment #1</p>
<p>The purpose of Amendment #1 is to address questions submitted by interested offerors and for USU to clarify our requirement.  For the answers, refer to the 16Q0001 Q&amp;A Amend 1 attachment.  The questions are in black font and the answers are in red font.  The changes to other attachments, e.g. 16Q0001 Request for Quotes (RFQ Amend 1) and 16Q0001 Equipment Pricing Amend 1 are highlighted in yellow in the attachments for Amendment #1.  Interested offerors must disregard the original attachments and work with the new attachments on FBO.gov for the Amendment #1.  Offerors must note in their quotes that they acknowledge the Amendment #1.<br />&emsp;<br />Introduction</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for repair and maintenance of most of the equipment at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU or the Government) and Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, which falls under USU.  Hereby the term "USU" and "the Government" refers to instruments at both installations in Bethesda, MD.  Section B, the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet, is an attachment.  The Government plans to issue time-and-material (T&amp;M) and/or firm-fixed price (FFP) blanket purchase agreement(s) (BPAs) to maximize the cost savings to the Government.  Please read the entire solicitation to understand the procurement process before completing this Excel document.  We strongly encourage you to ask timely questions if issues are unclear.  All questions will be answered with an amendment to this request for quotes (RFQ).&emsp;<br />B. Pricing</p>
<p>Refer to the attached HU0001-16-Q-0001 Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet (.xlsx file).  Offerors must complete and submit this electronic document for award consideration.  Please note the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet has two sheets within the file: One for equipment information and one for pricing sheet.&emsp;<br />C. Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>C.1 General Overview:</p>
<p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU or the Government) and Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, which fall under USU, located in Bethesda, MD, has a requirement to streamline our medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous equipment service procurements.  Historically, USU has issued individual purchase orders for each piece of equipment.  This solicitation will secure these services for nearly all equipment using awards that are designed to reduce administration, reduce down time, and maximize cost savings through reduced administrative costs and increased economies of scale.</p>
<p>The USU is the only Federal health sciences university and we are committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war.  We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and with scientists who serve the common good.  We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness.  USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda. Additional information regarding USU and its mission can be found on our website: www.usuhs.mil.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotes (RFQ) for commercial items in accordance with the procedures of FAR part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, including FAR subpart 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.  This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-85, effective December 4, 2015 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), effective November 30, 2015.</p>
<p>USU requires the awardee(s) to provide repair and maintenance service on our medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous instruments.  The number of annual preventive maintenance (PM) visits will vary with each unit of instrument according to manufacturer's guidelines.  This consolidation of our maintenance services is a new requirement for USU and there is no incumbent contractor currently providing this service.  However, we currently hold numerous annual purchase orders (POs) and option contracts with various vendors that maintain our instruments.  The details are included in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The Government's plan is to award multiple, ten-year, blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) with Time-and-Material (T&amp;M) and/or Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) pricing.  Offerors may offer service for only those instruments they are capable and are interested in maintaining; you are not required to submit an offer for every contract line item number (CLIN).  You are also neither required to offer both T&amp;M and FFP nor all ten years of service.  A single award is possible but considered unlikely.  The award decision on each type and model of equipment will be made individually based on best value and it is anticipated that some offerors will be selected for multiple CLINs.  Upon evaluation of all responsive quotes, if USU determines no offers are in the best interest of the Government for certain CLINs, we reserve the right not to award those lines.</p>
<p>The Government will decide the best agreement cost/price type(s) for the Government upon evaluation of all quotes for each item.  The Government may issue a BPA using both T&amp;M and FFP to the same awardee.  The Government reserves the right to determine the price/cost type, the duration of the agreement(s), and the number of agreements and awardees upon the Government's evaluation of all responsive quotes.  The Government's intent is to give strong consideration to T&amp;M offers to minimize unnecessary cost on those instruments that require little to no maintenance.  USU believes the Government will benefit from an overall cost savings from a T&amp;M pricing model.  However, in the future, if the Government subsequently determines that the FFP pricing is more advantageous for an individual CLIN, the pricing may be converted using the offered prices. To minimize confusion, the Government will limit conversion frequency to not more than once each year for each CLIN.  Offerors should define their terms and conditions in their quotes.  Those offerors quoting both FFP and T&amp;M pricings must clearly indicate in their quotes whether there will be any difference to the service in terms of response time and repair time, i.e. T&amp;M agreement will result in 5-day delay in servicing the instrument compared to FFP agreement.</p>
<p>The agreement(s) will likely include all the medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous instruments listed in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet [Section B].  This is an evolving list as USU acquires new instruments and retire aging instrument; therefore, the Government cannot guarantee 100% accuracy at the time of this RFQ posting.  Interested offerors, nonetheless, should assume that this spreadsheet is complete and accurate when developing their quotes.  Interested offerors must note that the instruments to be included in this agreement(s) may ultimately vary.  USU will also add new instruments and remove existing instrument as USU deems necessary before and after the award.  New equipment will be added to the BPA of the best offer awardee providing service to the same make and model or to similar or successor models of the same equipment.  The Government's desire is to amalgamate as many service requirements into smallest number of agreement(s) to simplify administration.  However, USU intends to make the award decision for each instrument separately and recognizes that many split awards are possible; hence, the administrative effort will be a consideration in choosing awardees.</p>
<p>This requirement is not set aside for small business concerns.  The applicable Federal Supply Code (FSC) is J066 Maintenance, Maintenance and Repair of Instruments and Laboratory Equipment.  In order to be eligible for award, offerors must be registered on SAM.gov with completed Representations &amp; Certifications (Reps &amp; Certs).</p>
<p>The Secretary of Labor has exempted from the Service Contract Labor Standards statute those contracts and subcontracts in which the primary purpose is to furnish maintenance, calibration, or repair of scientific equipment and medical apparatus or equipment.  In order to be exempt, interested offerors must correctly certify and submit the attached Required Provisions document in the quote submission, including 52.222-48 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</p>
<p>C.2 Statement of Work:</p>

Offerors must also keep a detailed log of all services scheduled and performed.</p>
<p>These are not the only requirements.  Additional requirements are detailed below and in the M. Evaluation Factors for Award section.</p>
<p>C.2.2. Scope of Work:</p>
<p>Awardee(s) shall provide unlimited emergency (remedial) repairs when required on all awarded items listed in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet.  Based on the Government's evaluation, we will determine the best value awardees for certain brand and/or type of instruments.  As our needs change, USU will add or delete service requirements from existing BPAs with the previously determined best-value awardees.  Awardee(s) must provide all labor, parts, materials, tools, transportation, and management necessary to fulfill our service requirements.  All work must be completed in accordance with the OEMs' specifications.</p>
<p>Awardee(s) shall perform PMs in accordance with the OEMs' recommendations during the period of performance (PoP).  USU will not accept PM-only offers on any of our instruments.  Awardee(s) must track and initiate all PM visits.  Awardee(s) shall not assume the Government will request or remind when PMs are due.  Awardee(s) must provide all labor, parts, software, materials, tools, transportation, and management necessary to fulfill our service requirements.  All work must be completed in accordance with the OEMs' specifications and operability.</p>
<p>Awardee(s) must provide technical, application, and operational support to Government personnel on an as-needed basis via phone, on-site, or other means.</p>
<p>USU must be able to place an unlimited number of service calls with the awardee(s).  USU requests that awardee(s) respond to all calls as soon as possible (ideally within one (1) business day (weekends and Government holidays excluded)) and that all repairs be completed in accordance with the proposed time frame in the offeror's proposed timeline in Section B.  Interested offerors are invited to detail their own timelines.  If the pricing type (FFP versus T&amp;M) will affect how quickly the awardee will respond/repair, such information must be disclosed in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 spreadsheet [Section B].  Failure to do so will result in the Government assuming that there is no difference between FFP and T&amp;M in respect to response and repair times.</p>
<p>USU asks the offerors to be accountable for delays or failure in providing timely service with self-proposed voluntary daily credit (a reimbursement to the Government for each day the awardee fails to repair beyond the promised repair time).  This credit will demonstrate the offeror's confidence in its ability to perform timely and effectively.  This information will be considered as part of the Technical and Awardee Accountability evaluation factors.  Offerors may choose not to propose a credit.  However, those offerors who do propose a credit may be rated more favorably.</p>
<p>Awardee(s) must be able to provide service during the Government's normal business hours (Monday through Friday, Federal holidays excluded, from 7:30am ET (0730 hours) to 4:00pm ET (1600 hours).  In some instances, the Government may request emergency repairs outside the normal business hours.  If available, such service will be incorporated into the agreement.</p>
<p>USU would like to be able to speak directly with the service provider (usually the OEM) to troubleshoot over the phone.  This is to resolve simple, minor inquiries and concerns.  It is also to streamline the service call process and to better explain our issue to the party who best understands the equipment.</p>
<p>The Government strongly recommends the awardees perform an initial inspection on all their awarded instruments during the first service or PM visit to ensure the units are operating in accordance with the OEM specifications and operability.  The Government will consider separate charges to recertify deficient instruments as deemed necessary.  After the first inspection, the Government will expect the awardees to perform strictly to OEM specifications and operability.  Failure to do so may result in cancellation of the BPA and poor performance reviews for future Government contracts/agreements.</p>
<p>USU have irradiators that must be serviced per the NRC Guidelines.  Most of these irradiators are "hardened" machines that are set in place and may be difficult to service.  Awardees must take care when servicing such instruments.  The awardees are fully responsible for all damages.</p>
<p>All awardee-supplied test equipment used to service the instruments must be NIST certified.  All work must be performed in accordance with Federal, state, and local regulations.</p>
<p>An awardee shall not consider this as a requirements contract.  The Government reserves the right to utilize other sources if deemed in our best interest.</p>
<p>C.2.3 Documentation of Services:</p>
<p>The request for service, except PMs, will be made by the USU Technical Service Branch (TSB) usually via a service call or an email request.  On some occasions, a research end-user (customer) will dial a three-way conference call among the customer, USU TSB, and the awardee.  When TSB is not available for a conference call, the customer may make a direct service call with the awardee.  Whenever TSB does not initiate the service call, the USU customer who places the three-way or direct two-way calls must follow with an authorization email to USU TSB and the awardee with the subject line "[BPA number] Service Authorization."  For those service calls initiated by the customer, not TSB, the awardees must ensure that the customer has issued the authorization email to TSB before providing the necessary service.  USU TSB is the coordinating office for all service calls and may at times reject the customer's requests.</p>
<p>If a vendor proposes to charge for telephone consultations on a T&amp;M basis, an e-mail authorization must be generated by USU and a detailed field service report (FSR) must be issued by the awardee.  Upon completion of every service, awardee(s) must produce an electronic and/or hardcopy FSR and share a copy with USU TSB.  Only the FSRs will serve as the evidence of all services and PMs performed, including the duration and purpose of telephone consultations.  USU cannot and will not process payments until the awardee provides a complete FSR and a copy of the authorization e-mail.  Each report must include, at minimum:<br />2.2.1.1	The company and technician information, including contact number and email;<br />2.2.1.2	The duration and purpose of the call (if calls are separately charged under T&amp;M agreements);<br />2.2.1.3	The date and location of the service;<br />2.2.1.4	The description of the instrument (e.g. make, model, and serial number);<br />2.2.1.5	All work performed, including description and number of hours; and<br />2.2.1.6	All parts used, including pertinent catalog numbers.<br />2.2.1.7	Offerors shall indicate if their FSR includes signature of the user to indicate satisfaction with the work performed.</p>
<p>We require the awardee(s) to digitally maintain a detailed log of all service calls and work performed.  Ideally, we prefer the log to be kept in Microsoft Excel .xlsx file format.  This log must be updated with each service performed and the updated electronic copy must be emailed to the appropriate USU personnel-to be determined-after each service.  We will consider other forms of this electronic log offered by interested offerors.  This log must not be made public to anyone without an explicit consent by the USU TSB and the USU Acquisition Directorate (ACQ).  The following information must be logged at a minimum:<br />2.2.2.1	Award number;<br />2.2.2.2	Unique identification number for each service;<br />2.2.2.3	Date of service call;<br />2.2.2.4	Name of caller;<br />2.2.2.5	Description of the issue/concern;<br />2.2.2.6	Name of service provider (OEM/independent service provider (ISP)) and its technician(s) who serviced the instrument;<br />2.2.2.7	Date of service completed; and<br />2.2.2.8	Any follow-up and additional notes.</p>
<p>Once a year, USU will require the awardee(s) to sign and certify the Certificate of Conformance to Manufacturer's Specifications and Operability [see Section J].  If an instrument fails to meet the OEM specifications and operability, the awardee of the agreement will be required to fully pay for all costs associated with recertifying the instrument.</p>
<p>This documentation requirement is applicable for all awardees regardless of the pricing method.</p>
<p>C.2.4 Standards of Workmanship:</p>
<p>The quality of all services and supplies rendered are critical to the validity and performance of research at USU and must conform to the highest standards in the relevant profession, trade, or field of endeavor.  All services and supplies will be provided directly by individuals fully qualified in the relevant profession, trade, or field and must hold all relevant licenses and/or certifications required by the industry as well as applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The awardee(s) must perform all services in accordance with the OEM's specifications and must provide all, if any, OEM system hardware, software, and firmware updates throughout the term of the award whenever released by the OEM, unless explicitly directed otherwise.  Accordingly, all work must result in the equipment performing to 100% OEM specifications.</p>
<p>C.2.5 Technical Service Qualifications:</p>
<p>All service technicians who will provide service to the equipment covered by this agreement must be OEM factory trained and certified or demonstrate equivalency.  All service technicians must maintain up-to-date knowledge and information regarding repair of and performance enhancements to the equipment per the OEM-issued technical bulletins.</p>
<p>C.2.6 Subcontracting:</p>
<p>Offerors are free to establish teaming and/or subcontracting relations with other companies.  The prime awardee must maintain a positive working relationship with all subcontractors to minimize performance risks to the Government.</p>
<p>C.2.7 Software/Firmware Updates:</p>
<p>Some instruments will require software/firmware updates in accordance with the OEM's release and instructions.  All updates must be coordinated with USU Network Operations and Communications Directorate (NOC) before deployment.  Further instructions for software/firmware approval will be provided on as-needed basis.</p>
<p>Offerors should note (1) if the software/firmware updates are likely to be issued by the OEM for each piece of instrument, (2) if you will provide such updates, and (3) if there will be an additional charge.</p>
<p>C.2.8 Lockout/Tagout (LOTO):</p>
<p>Energy sources including electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical, thermal, or other sources in machines and equipment can be hazardous to workers.  To prevent accidents, awardees must adhere to their proper lockout/tagout (LOTO) practice and guidelines.  Awardees must also be proactive in training its employees of their LOTO procedures.</p>
<p>Awardees are fully responsible for all accidents and damages resulting from their negligence or noncompliance to its LOTO procedures.</p>
<p>C.2.9 BPA Calls:</p>
<p>USU TSB is the division within the USU Logistics (LOG) Department that will handle all service needs.  When a service need arises, the USU department that owns the instrument will call TSB for them to unilaterally initiate a service call with the awardee.  Sometimes, the customer from the department with the service need will call the awardee directly for a three-way conference call among the department, TSB, and the awardee.  This is to ensure that TSB is aware of may service requirements at USU.  If TSB is unavailable for the conference call, the department will call the awardee directly.  In either case, if a customer outside of TSB places the call, she/he must always follow the call with an authorization email of the details of the conversation to TSB and to the awardee.  The awardee must not perform service prior to receiving this email from the customer to TSB and to the awardee.</p>
<p>In the BPA, we may define a list of authorized callers who may place the service calls and make payments.  The authorized callers will consist mainly of select Government representatives from USU TSB and various USU departments.  This list will be maintain internally by the USU ACQ.  Only a contracting officer has the authority to modify this list.  This list will not be incorporated into the BPA and an updated list will be provided to the awardees on an as-needed basis.  This list will surely evolve over time.  Once the awardee agrees to provide the service by scheduling a visit, all BPA calls are binding and all terms and conditions of the agreement must be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The dollar limitation for each individual purchase under the BPA shall not exceed $50,000.00.</p>
<p>The Government is only obligated for authorized purchases made under the BPA.</p>
<p>C.2.10 Addition or Deletion of Instruments:</p>
<p>The agreement may be modified by the Government with a written notice to add or delete items or to on a pro-rated or T&amp;M basis.</p>
<p>Over time, USU will acquire new instruments.  Based on this solicitation evaluation, USU will determine those vendors best suited to service certain model instruments.  For the full agreement duration, new instruments most likely be added to those best-value awardees with a positive performance history for the identical or similar models.  However, this is not a requirements contract.  The Government may seek other procurement options.  We may decide to compete the new service requirement among all interested offerors in the market to add to an existing BPA or to award a new BPA.</p>
<p>Awardees may request an inspection of the new instruments.  If the prices have not been established for the same brand and model in the initial agreement, the Government will consider new fair and reasonable T&amp;M and/or FFP proposed pricing from the awardee.  Offerors are encouraged to discuss future pricing strategies.</p>
<p>USU will also decommission aging instruments over time.  The Government will provide this information in writing to the appropriate awardee for removal.  The removal will take effect from the date of this notice from the Government.</p>
<p>Addition and deletion of instruments will not affect the T&amp;M CLINs.  For FFP CLINs, the cost for the coverage shall be prorated based on the number of months the instrument is actually covered under the agreement.  The instrument must have been covered for at least 15 calendar days of the month for payment.  If an instrument was covered for less than 15 days, we will pay based on prorated daily rate.</p>
<p>C.2.11 Relocation Services:</p>
<p>On occasions, USU may require a relocation service of an instrument.  This service includes uninstalling, moving, reinstalling, and recalibrating.  Offerors are encouraged to offer such service if available.  If prices are indeterminable at the time of quote, offerors must detail their established pricing practice on how they will provide the best prices to the Government.</p>
<p>C.2.12 Offsite Repairs:</p>
<p>Offerors must indicate those instruments that must be shipped offsite of USU for repairs.  Offerors must also detail the logistics of shipment, any special instructions, and the billing rate for transporting the instrument.  Offeror assumes liability for any damages occurring during shipment or while being serviced offsite.</p>
<p>C.2.13 Customer Dissatisfaction:</p>
<p>Should a customer express any dissatisfaction with the services rendered by an awardee or about the performance and condition of an item after having been services, the customer will formally express her/his dissatisfaction in writing to USU TSB.  USU TSB will review all written complaints for validity and forward its comments to the contracting officer if deemed appropriate.  The contracting officer will then contact the awardee and forward the written complaint with a request for response.  Awardees must respond to the written complaint and resolve the situation within two business days.</p>
<p>C.2.14 Cancellation of BPA:</p>
<p>To avoid adversely affecting the Government's mission, the awardee must submit its BPA cancellation request in writing to the appropriate contracting officer at least 90 days in advance.</p>
<p>C.2.15 Invoices and Payments:</p>
<p>The Government will make the payments for each call in arrears not more often than monthly.  Contract financing will not be authorized for this requirement.  Awardee(s) must submit a complete summary invoice for the BPA to the appropriate Government officials per the FAR 52.212-4(g) Invoices and the agreement.  Charges for other orders must be submitted on separate invoices.</p>
<p>For both T&amp;M and FFP CLINs, the Government will make single monthly payment.  The awardees must submit a complete invoice itemizing all charges for the month to USU TSB.  The Government will not process the payment without an FSR, the authorizing e-mail and an invoice to the USU TSB.  All payments will be made in arrears.</p>
<p>All payments will be made using Visa Governmental Purchase Card (GPC).  Electronic funds transfer (EFT) as a form of payment will not be authorized for this BPA.</p>
<p>C.2.16 Base access and Parking:</p>
<p>Awardee(s) must ensure that its personnel are able to obtain US military base access.  Refer to the base access instructions in the following site:<br />http://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrsw/installations/navbase_coronado/om/force_protection/base_access.html</p>
<p>Awardees are highly encourage to enroll in the long-term RAPIDGate pre-vetted base access.  Delayed or failure to perform due to awardee's negligence in ensuring base access will not be permitted as an excusable delay.</p>
<p>The detailed parking instructions will be provided at a later date.</p>
<p>C.2.17 Misuse and Abuse:</p>
<p>Service and parts required due to misuse, abuse, or damage due to external causes beyond the control of the awardee may not be the responsibility of the awardee.   The awardee shall furnish the details of possible misuse to TSB within three business days.  USU TSB shall determine the appropriateness of additional payment and any unresolved disputes will be forwarded to the contracting officer for final determination.</p>
<p>C.2.18 Required DoD Manpower Reporting:</p>
<p>Awardees shall report all labor hours, including subcontractor labor hours, required for performance of services provided under this agreement via a secure data collection site. The awardees are required to completely fill in all required data fields using the following web address: http://www.ecmra.mil/.</p>
<p>The reporting inputs will be for the labor executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs October 1 through September 30.  While inputs may be reported any time during the FY, all data shall be reported no later than 31 October for the period of performance of the preceding fiscal year.  Awardees may direct questions to the help desk at help desk at: http://www.ecmra.mil/.&emsp;<br />L. Format</p>

<p>L.3 In-Person Oral Presentation:</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to request an in-person oral presentation as deemed fit.  If oral presentations are requested by the Government, the company must consent to recording the presentation.  The date and location of the presentation will be discussed and determined at a later date.&emsp;<br />M. Evaluation Factors for Award</p>
<p>The Government will award to the responsible vendor(s) whose offer, conforming to this announcement, will be most advantageous to the Government based on best value trade-offs.</p>
<p>The Government is not required to award to the lowest-priced offeror or to the highest technically-rated offeror.  Award(s) will be made to the offeror(s) whose quote(s) is/are technically acceptable and whose Past Performance, Awardee Accountability, Corporate Experience, and Price are the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p>The Government may reject any quotes that have been determined to be unrealistic in terms of price when compared to the Government cost estimate, market research, and other offers.  A quote may also be rejected if the offeror does not display a clear understanding of the requirements or the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>All non-Price evaluation factors when combined are more important than Price.  But as the non-Price evaluation factors are rated more equally among the technically-acceptable offers, the importance of Price will increase.</p>
<p>Evaluation factors are listed in the order of importance, with the most important being listed first:<br />3.1.	Technical,<br />3.2.	Past Performance<br />3.3.	Corporate Experience,<br />3.4.	Awardee Accountability, and<br />3.5.	Price.</p>
<p>Offerors are permitted to submit their standard ("minimal") quote submission.  This standard quote would be a quote that a vendor would typically submit to its Government customers.  Upon the Government's evaluation, as we deem it necessary, we will open dialogues directly with the offerors.</p>
<p>M.1 Technical:</p>
<p>Offerors should, at minimum, describe their technical approach to fulfill the following:<br />M.1.1.	Provide and certify maintenance service in accordance with the OEM specifications and operability;<br />M.1.2.	Provide PMs and/or software updates, if applicable, as described in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 attachment;<br />M.1.3.	Available during the Government's normal business hours (Monday through Friday, Federal holidays excluded, from 7:30am ET (0730 hours) to 4:00pm ET (1600 hours));<br />M.1.4.	Sometimes the Government may require service outside the normal business hours listed in M.1.3.  If such service is available, the quote must include the terms, conditions, and the prices for such repairs;<br />M.1.5.	Disclose whether or not a direct telephone access to the service technician/provider is available to USU users.  If not, please propose how you plan to resolve simple, minor inquiries or concerns;<br />M.1.6.	Offer guaranteed response and repair time, including any contingencies;<br />M.1.7.	Issue field service report (FSR) to USU TSB  upon each call and service visit;<br />M.1.8.	Maintain a secure digital log of all services;<br />M.1.9.	Hold all relevant licenses and/or certifications required by the industry as well as applicable laws and regulations;<br />M.1.10.	Offer customer- and industry-relations plan as well as letters of commitment from subcontractors to maintain and improve ongoing relationships to ensure satisfactory performance;<br />M.1.11.	Propose innovative solutions to satisfy the Government's service requirements that we may not have yet considered;<br />M.1.12.	Define all teaming and/or subcontracting plans.  Letters of Commitment from the subcontractors will be evaluated favorably;<br />M.1.13.	Detail how often the software/firmware updates will be deployed and how it will be implemented for those applicable instruments;<br />M.1.14.	Detail the proper lockout/tagout (LOTO) practice and guidelines as well as its training plans of its employees.</p>
<p>Those technical quotes that best fulfills our requirements and most aptly addresses our existing and potential future risks will be rated higher.</p>
<p>M.2 Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government shall evaluate the offerors' present and past performance references.  Offerors must provide three (3) contract/award numbers with Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) reports for similar work performed.  Copies of the entire CPARS evaluation must be provided in the quote package.</p>
<p>If CPARS reports are not available, offerors must provide three (3) references with which the offeror has had performance history in similar complexity and scope as the USU requirement.  The Government reserves the right to select which references to contact.  The following should be provided for each reference:<br />M.2.1.	Name of agency and/or business;<br />M.2.2.	The address of the agency and/or business;<br />M.2.3.	Name of current point-of-contact, including title, phone number, and email address;<br />M.2.4.	Contract/agreement number;<br />M.2.5.	Contract/agreement value;<br />M.2.6.	Contract/agreement period of performance; and<br />M.2.7.	Brief description of the service(s) provided.</p>
<p>The three past performance CPARS reports or references should include at least one internal USU CPARS report or reference if available.</p>
<p>More than three past performance CPARS reports or references will not be considered.  USU may request additional information at any time.</p>
<p>If there were any teaming/subcontracting efforts, the past performance contact must be of the prime entity.</p>
<p>Offerors will have an opportunity to timely address any adverse past performance history.  Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably; instead those offerors will be rated a Neutral/Unknown rating.  Offerors must clearly state in their quote if they do not have at least three past performance references.  Failure to address this information may render an offeror's quote nonresponsive and may not be considered for award by the Government.</p>
<p>A history of relevant strong past performance will be more advantageous to the offeror than a less relevant record of strong performance.  The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternative sources in conducting our assessment of past performance history.</p>
<p>M.3 Corporate Experience:</p>
<p>Offerors must provide a narrative of their experience in providing the same or similar type and complexity of services requested.  In addition, offerors must also describe the following experience:<br />M.3.1.	Experience in providing maintenance services or maintenance management services, including with different types of entity, e.g. Federal Government, state and local government, private companies, hospitals, universities, etc.;<br />M.3.2.	Experience in facilitating emergency service requests and dealing with prolonged, difficult maintenance services;<br />M.3.3.	Experience in executing difference types of Federal Government contracts/agreements, especially FFP and T&amp;M contracts/agreements; and<br />M.3.4.	Experience in servicing various types and brands of equipment.  Offerors should list all the equipment they are able to service.</p>
<p>Those offerors with rich history of related corporate experience will be rated higher.</p>
<p>M.4 Awardee Accountability:</p>
<p>The Government requests the awardee(s) to be accountable of the services they promise to provide.  Offerors must present its quote in good faith and must offer a plan in case the Government receives delayed or unsatisfactory service.  Offerors must present realistic response and repair times.  Offerors may opt to offer voluntary daily credit for delays or failure to render promised services.  These factors will be reflected in this evaluation.  Offerors must detail all contingencies to this plan as they deem necessary.</p>
<p>M.5 Price:</p>
<p>Interested offerors must complete the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 attachment and submit an electronic copy for award consideration.</p>
<p>Offered prices must include all pertinent cost, including but not limited to parts, labor, travel, and profit.  The total price will be the evaluated price.  Interest offerors are encouraged to offer both FFP and T&amp;M prices for each line of equipment they propose to maintain.  Offers that provide only FFP or T&amp;M prices, but not both, will be considered without prejudice.  Ultimately, the resulting award(s) could contain both FFP and T&amp;M prices for different CLINs.</p>
<p>For T&amp;M pricing, offerors must offer every facet of cost; including how PMs, software/firmware updates, and addition of new instruments will be priced.</p>
<p>USU recognizes that these are commercial services and future fixed prices or labor rates are uncertain; therefore, offerors are encouraged to provide proposed future price adjustment formulas.  It would be wise to peg these formula to your best customer pricing and to explain the deviations from that price, e.g. Government/university discounts.  The proposed price adjustment interval will also be evaluated.</p>

Hereby the term "USU" and "the Government" refers to instruments at both installations in Bethesda, MD.  Section B, the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 / Amend 3 spreadsheet, is an attachment.  The Government plans to issue time-and-material (T&amp;M) and/or firm-fixed price (FFP) blanket purchase agreement(s) (BPAs) to maximize the cost savings to the Government.  Please read the entire solicitation to understand the procurement process before completing this Excel document.  We strongly encourage you to ask timely questions if issues are unclear.  All questions will be answered with an amendment to this request for quotes (RFQ).&emsp;<br />B. Pricing</p>
<p>Refer to the attached HU0001-16-Q-0001 Equipment Pricing Amend 1 or Amend 3 spreadsheet (.xlsx file).  Offerors must complete and submit this electronic document for award consideration.  Please note the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 or Amend 3 spreadsheet has two sheets within the file: One titled "Equipment Information" and one titled "Pricing Sheet."  Offerors must complete the one titled "Pricing Sheet" and email a completed electronic copy.&emsp;<br />C. Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>C.1 General Overview:</p>
<p>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU or the Government) and Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, which fall under USU, located in Bethesda, MD, has a requirement to streamline our medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous equipment service procurements.  Historically, USU has issued individual purchase orders for each piece of equipment.  This solicitation will secure these services for nearly all equipment using awards that are designed to reduce administration, reduce down time, and maximize cost savings through reduced administrative costs and increased economies of scale.</p>
<p>The USU is the only Federal health sciences university and we are committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war.  We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and with scientists who serve the common good.  We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness.  USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda. Additional information regarding USU and its mission can be found on our website: www.usuhs.mil.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotes (RFQ) for commercial items in accordance with the procedures of FAR part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, including FAR subpart 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.  This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-85, effective December 4, 2015 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), effective November 30, 2015.</p>
<p>USU requires the awardee(s) to provide repair and maintenance service on our medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous instruments.  The number of annual preventive maintenance (PM) visits will vary with each unit of instrument according to manufacturer's guidelines.  This consolidation of our maintenance services is a new requirement for USU and there is no incumbent contractor currently providing this service.  However, we currently hold numerous annual purchase orders (POs) and option contracts with various vendors that maintain our instruments.  The details are included in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 / Amend 3  spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The Government's plan is to award multiple, ten-year, blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) with Time-and-Material (T&amp;M) and/or Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) pricing.  Offerors may offer service for only those instruments they are capable and are interested in maintaining; you are not required to submit an offer for every contract line item number (CLIN).  You are also neither required to offer both T&amp;M and FFP nor all ten years of service.  A single award is possible but considered unlikely.  The award decision on each type and model of equipment will be made individually based on best value and it is anticipated that some offerors will be selected for multiple CLINs.  Upon evaluation of all responsive quotes, if USU determines no offers are in the best interest of the Government for certain CLINs, we reserve the right not to award those lines.</p>
<p>The Government will decide the best agreement cost/price type(s) for the Government upon evaluation of all quotes for each item.  The Government may issue a BPA using both T&amp;M and FFP to the same awardee.  The Government reserves the right to determine the price/cost type, the duration of the agreement(s), and the number of agreements and awardees upon the Government's evaluation of all responsive quotes.  The Government's intent is to give strong consideration to T&amp;M offers to minimize unnecessary cost on those instruments that require little to no maintenance.  USU believes the Government will benefit from an overall cost savings from a T&amp;M pricing model.  However, in the future, if the Government subsequently determines that the FFP pricing is more advantageous for an individual CLIN, the pricing may be converted using the offered prices. To minimize confusion, the Government will limit conversion frequency to not more than once each year for each CLIN.  Offerors should define their terms and conditions in their quotes.  Those offerors quoting both FFP and T&amp;M pricings must clearly indicate in their quotes whether there will be any difference to the service in terms of response time and repair time, i.e. T&amp;M agreement will result in 5-day delay in servicing the instrument compared to FFP agreement.</p>
<p>The agreement(s) will likely include all the medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous instruments listed in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 / Amend 3 spreadsheet [Section B].  This is an evolving list as USU acquires new instruments and retire aging instrument; therefore, the Government cannot guarantee 100% accuracy at the time of this RFQ posting.  Interested offerors, nonetheless, should assume that this spreadsheet is complete and accurate when developing their quotes.  Interested offerors must note that the instruments to be included in this agreement(s) may ultimately vary.  USU will also add new instruments and remove existing instrument as USU deems necessary before and after the award.  New equipment will be added to the BPA of the best offer awardee providing service to the same make and model or to similar or successor models of the same equipment.  The Government's desire is to amalgamate as many service requirements into smallest number of agreement(s) to simplify administration.  However, USU intends to make the award decision for each instrument separately and recognizes that many split awards are possible; hence, the administrative effort will be a consideration in choosing awardees.</p>
<p>This requirement is not set aside for small business concerns.  The applicable Federal Supply Code (FSC) is J066 Maintenance, Maintenance and Repair of Instruments and Laboratory Equipment.  In order to be eligible for award, offerors must be registered on SAM.gov with completed Representations &amp; Certifications (Reps &amp; Certs).</p>
<p>The Secretary of Labor has exempted from the Service Contract Labor Standards statute those contracts and subcontracts in which the primary purpose is to furnish maintenance, calibration, or repair of scientific equipment and medical apparatus or equipment.  In order to be exempt, interested offerors must correctly certify and submit the attached Required Provisions document in the quote submission, including 52.222-48 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</p>
<p>C.2 Statement of Work:</p>
<p>C.2.1 Desired Requirements:</p>
<p>Offerors responding to this solicitation should, at a minimum, meet the requirements listed below.  Offers that do not meet the following will be deemed less technically capable than those offers that do meet the following requirements:<br />C.2.1.1.	Offerors must be able to offer multiple years of required service (ideally for ten years) for at least one of our medical, laboratory, and other miscellaneous instruments;<br />C.2.1.2.	Offerors must propose time-and-material (T&amp;M) and/or firm-fixed-price (FFP) offers;<br />C.2.1.3.	Offerors must be able to provide service in accordance with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications and operability;<br />C.2.1.4.	Offerors must be able to quickly address the Government's concerns and rectify all issues in a timely manner;<br />C.2.1.5.	Offerors must have at least two years of experience in directly or indirectly servicing major medical, laboratory, and/or other miscellaneous equipment;<br />C.2.1.6.	Offerors must have a clear, detailed plan on how they plan on fulfilling our service needs and how they address to complaints;<br />C.2.1.7.	Offerors must have all personnel who can obtain base access;<br />C.2.1.8.	Offerors must be able to present consolidated monthly invoices for monthly lump-sum payments of all instruments with the awardee;<br />C.2.1.9.	If an offeror is planning to work with subcontractors, the offeror must be able to coordinate all aspects of the maintenance, including the service and payment, with no involvement of the Government; and<br />C.2.1.10.	Every service must be substantiated with a detailed field service report (FSR), which must be given to appropriate USU representative(s) upon completion of all service.  Offerors must also keep a detailed log of all services scheduled and performed.</p>
<p>These are not the only requirements.  Additional requirements are detailed below and in the M. Evaluation Factors for Award section.</p>
<p>C.2.2. Scope of Work:</p>
<p>Awardee(s) shall provide unlimited emergency (remedial) repairs when required on all awarded items listed in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 / Amend 3 spreadsheet.  Based on the Government's evaluation, we will determine the best value awardees for certain brand and/or type of instruments.  As our needs change, USU will add or delete service requirements from existing BPAs with the previously determined best-value awardees.  Awardee(s) must provide all labor, parts, materials, tools, transportation, and management necessary to fulfill our service requirements.  All work must be completed in accordance with the OEMs' specifications.</p>
<p>Awardee(s) shall perform PMs in accordance with the OEMs' recommendations during the period of performance (PoP).  USU will not accept PM-only offers on any of our instruments.  Awardee(s) must track and initiate all PM visits.  Awardee(s) shall not assume the Government will request or remind when PMs are due.  Awardee(s) must provide all labor, parts, software, materials, tools, transportation, and management necessary to fulfill our service requirements.  All work must be completed in accordance with the OEMs' specifications and operability.</p>
<p>Awardee(s) must provide technical, application, and operational support to Government personnel on an as-needed basis via phone, on-site, or other means.</p>
<p>USU must be able to place an unlimited number of service calls with the awardee(s).  USU requests that awardee(s) respond to all calls as soon as possible (ideally within one (1) business day (weekends and Government holidays excluded)) and that all repairs be completed in accordance with the proposed time frame in the offeror's proposed timeline in Section B.  Interested offerors are invited to detail their own timelines.  If the pricing type (FFP versus T&amp;M) will affect how quickly the awardee will respond/repair, such information must be disclosed in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 or Amend 3 spreadsheet [Section B].  Failure to do so will result in the Government assuming that there is no difference between FFP and T&amp;M in respect to response and repair times.</p>
<p>USU asks the offerors to be accountable for delays or failure in providing timely service with self-proposed voluntary daily credit (a reimbursement to the Government for each day the awardee fails to repair beyond the promised repair time).  This credit will demonstrate the offeror's confidence in its ability to perform timely and effectively.  This information will be considered as part of the Technical and Awardee Accountability evaluation factors.  Offerors may choose not to propose a credit.  However, those offerors who do propose a credit may be rated more favorably.</p>
<p>Awardee(s) must be able to provide service during the Government's normal business hours (Monday through Friday, Federal holidays excluded, from 7:30am ET (0730 hours) to 4:00pm ET (1600 hours).  In some instances, the Government may request emergency repairs outside the normal business hours.  If available, such service will be incorporated into the agreement.</p>
<p>USU would like to be able to speak directly with the service provider (usually the OEM) to troubleshoot over the phone.  This is to resolve simple, minor inquiries and concerns.  It is also to streamline the service call process and to better explain our issue to the party who best understands the equipment.</p>
<p>The Government strongly recommends the awardees perform an initial inspection on all their awarded instruments during the first service or PM visit to ensure the units are operating in accordance with the OEM specifications and operability.  The Government will consider separate charges to recertify deficient instruments as deemed necessary.  After the first inspection, the Government will expect the awardees to perform strictly to OEM specifications and operability.  Failure to do so may result in cancellation of the BPA and poor performance reviews for future Government contracts/agreements.</p>
<p>USU have irradiators that must be serviced per the NRC Guidelines.  Most of these irradiators are "hardened" machines that are set in place and may be difficult to service.  Awardees must take care when servicing such instruments.  The awardees are fully responsible for all damages.</p>
<p>All awardee-supplied test equipment used to service the instruments must be NIST certified.  All work must be performed in accordance with Federal, state, and local regulations.</p>
<p>An awardee shall not consider this as a requirements contract.  The Government reserves the right to utilize other sources if deemed in our best interest.</p>
<p>C.2.3 Documentation of Services:</p>
<p>The request for service, except PMs, will be made by the USU Technical Service Branch (TSB) usually via a service call or an email request.  On some occasions, a research end-user (customer) will dial a three-way conference call among the customer, USU TSB, and the awardee.  When TSB is not available for a conference call, the customer may make a direct service call with the awardee.  Whenever TSB does not initiate the service call, the USU customer who places the three-way or direct two-way calls must follow with an authorization email to USU TSB and the awardee with the subject line "[BPA number] Service Authorization."  For those service calls initiated by the customer, not TSB, the awardees must ensure that the customer has issued the authorization email to TSB before providing the necessary service.  USU TSB is the coordinating office for all service calls and may at times reject the customer's requests.</p>
<p>If a vendor proposes to charge for telephone consultations on a T&amp;M basis, an e-mail authorization must be generated by USU and a detailed field service report (FSR) must be issued by the awardee.  Upon completion of every service, awardee(s) must produce an electronic and/or hardcopy FSR and share a copy with USU TSB.  Only the FSRs will serve as the evidence of all services and PMs performed, including the duration and purpose of telephone consultations.  USU cannot and will not process payments until the awardee provides a complete FSR and a copy of the authorization e-mail.  Each report must include, at minimum:<br />2.2.1.1	The company and technician information, including contact number and email;<br />2.2.1.2	The duration and purpose of the call (if calls are separately charged under T&amp;M agreements);<br />2.2.1.3	The date and location of the service;<br />2.2.1.4	The description of the instrument (e.g. make, model, and serial number);<br />2.2.1.5	All work performed, including description and number of hours; and<br />2.2.1.6	All parts used, including pertinent catalog numbers.<br />2.2.1.7	Offerors shall indicate if their FSR includes signature of the user to indicate satisfaction with the work performed.</p>
<p>We require the awardee(s) to digitally maintain a detailed log of all service calls and work performed.  Ideally, we prefer the log to be kept in Microsoft Excel .xlsx file format.  This log must be updated with each service performed and the updated electronic copy must be emailed to the appropriate USU personnel-to be determined-after each service.  We will consider other forms of this electronic log offered by interested offerors.  This log must not be made public to anyone without an explicit consent by the USU TSB and the USU Acquisition Directorate (ACQ).  The following information must be logged at a minimum:<br />2.2.2.1	Award number;<br />2.2.2.2	Unique identification number for each service;<br />2.2.2.3	Date of service call;<br />2.2.2.4	Name of caller;<br />2.2.2.5	Description of the issue/concern;<br />2.2.2.6	Name of service provider (OEM/independent service provider (ISP)) and its technician(s) who serviced the instrument;<br />2.2.2.7	Date of service completed; and<br />2.2.2.8	Any follow-up and additional notes.</p>
<p>Once a year, USU will require the awardee(s) to sign and certify the Certificate of Conformance to Manufacturer's Specifications and Operability [see Section J].  If an instrument fails to meet the OEM specifications and operability, the awardee of the agreement will be required to fully pay for all costs associated with recertifying the instrument.</p>
<p>This documentation requirement is applicable for all awardees regardless of the pricing method.</p>
<p>C.2.4 Standards of Workmanship:</p>
<p>The quality of all services and supplies rendered are critical to the validity and performance of research at USU and must conform to the highest standards in the relevant profession, trade, or field of endeavor.  All services and supplies will be provided directly by individuals fully qualified in the relevant profession, trade, or field and must hold all relevant licenses and/or certifications required by the industry as well as applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The awardee(s) must perform all services in accordance with the OEM's specifications and must provide all, if any, OEM system hardware, software, and firmware updates throughout the term of the award whenever released by the OEM, unless explicitly directed otherwise.  Accordingly, all work must result in the equipment performing to 100% OEM specifications.</p>
<p>C.2.5 Technical Service Qualifications:</p>
<p>All service technicians who will provide service to the equipment covered by this agreement must be OEM factory trained and certified or demonstrate equivalency.  All service technicians must maintain up-to-date knowledge and information regarding repair of and performance enhancements to the equipment per the OEM-issued technical bulletins.</p>
<p>C.2.6 Subcontracting:</p>
<p>Offerors are free to establish teaming and/or subcontracting relations with other companies.  The prime awardee must maintain a positive working relationship with all subcontractors to minimize performance risks to the Government.</p>
<p>C.2.7 Software/Firmware Updates:</p>
<p>Some instruments will require software/firmware updates in accordance with the OEM's release and instructions.  All updates must be coordinated with USU Network Operations and Communications Directorate (NOC) before deployment.  Further instructions for software/firmware approval will be provided on as-needed basis.</p>
<p>Offerors should note (1) if the software/firmware updates are likely to be issued by the OEM for each piece of instrument, (2) if you will provide such updates, and (3) if there will be an additional charge.</p>
<p>C.2.8 Lockout/Tagout (LOTO):</p>
<p>Energy sources including electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical, thermal, or other sources in machines and equipment can be hazardous to workers.  To prevent accidents, awardees must adhere to their proper lockout/tagout (LOTO) practice and guidelines.  Awardees must also be proactive in training its employees of their LOTO procedures.</p>
<p>Awardees are fully responsible for all accidents and damages resulting from their negligence or noncompliance to its LOTO procedures.</p>
<p>C.2.9 BPA Calls:</p>
<p>USU TSB is the division within the USU Logistics (LOG) Department that will handle all service needs.  When a service need arises, the USU department that owns the instrument will call TSB for them to unilaterally initiate a service call with the awardee.  Sometimes, the customer from the department with the service need will call the awardee directly for a three-way conference call among the department, TSB, and the awardee.  This is to ensure that TSB is aware of may service requirements at USU.  If TSB is unavailable for the conference call, the department will call the awardee directly.  In either case, if a customer outside of TSB places the call, she/he must always follow the call with an authorization email of the details of the conversation to TSB and to the awardee.  The awardee must not perform service prior to receiving this email from the customer to TSB and to the awardee.</p>
<p>In the BPA, we may define a list of authorized callers who may place the service calls and make payments.  The authorized callers will consist mainly of select Government representatives from USU TSB and various USU departments.  This list will be maintain internally by the USU ACQ.  Only a contracting officer has the authority to modify this list.  This list will not be incorporated into the BPA and an updated list will be provided to the awardees on an as-needed basis.  This list will surely evolve over time.  Once the awardee agrees to provide the service by scheduling a visit, all BPA calls are binding and all terms and conditions of the agreement must be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The dollar limitation for each individual purchase under the BPA shall not exceed $50,000.00.</p>
<p>The Government is only obligated for authorized purchases made under the BPA.</p>
<p>C.2.10 Addition or Deletion of Instruments:</p>
<p>The agreement may be modified by the Government with a written notice to add or delete items or to on a pro-rated or T&amp;M basis.</p>
<p>Over time, USU will acquire new instruments.  Based on this solicitation evaluation, USU will determine those vendors best suited to service certain model instruments.  For the full agreement duration, new instruments most likely be added to those best-value awardees with a positive performance history for the identical or similar models.  However, this is not a requirements contract.  The Government may seek other procurement options.  We may decide to compete the new service requirement among all interested offerors in the market to add to an existing BPA or to award a new BPA.</p>
<p>Awardees may request an inspection of the new instruments.  If the prices have not been established for the same brand and model in the initial agreement, the Government will consider new fair and reasonable T&amp;M and/or FFP proposed pricing from the awardee.  Offerors are encouraged to discuss future pricing strategies.</p>
<p>USU will also decommission aging instruments over time.  The Government will provide this information in writing to the appropriate awardee for removal.  The removal will take effect from the date of this notice from the Government.</p>
<p>Addition and deletion of instruments will not affect the T&amp;M CLINs.  For FFP CLINs, the cost for the coverage shall be prorated based on the number of months the instrument is actually covered under the agreement.  The instrument must have been covered for at least 15 calendar days of the month for payment.  If an instrument was covered for less than 15 days, we will pay based on prorated daily rate.</p>
<p>C.2.11 Relocation Services:</p>
<p>On occasions, USU may require a relocation service of an instrument.  This service includes uninstalling, moving, reinstalling, and recalibrating.  Offerors are encouraged to offer such service if available.  If prices are indeterminable at the time of quote, offerors must detail their established pricing practice on how they will provide the best prices to the Government.</p>
<p>C.2.12 Offsite Repairs:</p>
<p>Offerors must indicate those instruments that must be shipped offsite of USU for repairs.  Offerors must also detail the logistics of shipment, any special instructions, and the billing rate for transporting the instrument.  Offeror assumes liability for any damages occurring during shipment or while being serviced offsite.</p>
<p>C.2.13 Customer Dissatisfaction:</p>
<p>Should a customer express any dissatisfaction with the services rendered by an awardee or about the performance and condition of an item after having been services, the customer will formally express her/his dissatisfaction in writing to USU TSB.  USU TSB will review all written complaints for validity and forward its comments to the contracting officer if deemed appropriate.  The contracting officer will then contact the awardee and forward the written complaint with a request for response.  Awardees must respond to the written complaint and resolve the situation within two business days.</p>
<p>C.2.14 Cancellation of BPA:</p>
<p>To avoid adversely affecting the Government's mission, the awardee must submit its BPA cancellation request in writing to the appropriate contracting officer at least 90 days in advance.</p>
<p>C.2.15 Invoices and Payments:</p>
<p>The Government will make the payments for each call in arrears not more often than monthly.  Contract financing will not be authorized for this requirement.  Awardee(s) must submit a complete summary invoice for the BPA to the appropriate Government officials per the FAR 52.212-4(g) Invoices and the agreement.  Charges for other orders must be submitted on separate invoices.</p>
<p>For both T&amp;M and FFP CLINs, the Government will make single monthly payment.  The awardees must submit a complete invoice itemizing all charges for the month to USU TSB.  The Government will not process the payment without an FSR, the authorizing e-mail and an invoice to the USU TSB.  All payments will be made in arrears.</p>
<p>All payments will be made using Visa Governmental Purchase Card (GPC).  Electronic funds transfer (EFT) as a form of payment will not be authorized for this BPA.</p>
<p>C.2.16 Base access and Parking:</p>
<p>Awardee(s) must ensure that its personnel are able to obtain US military base access.  Refer to the base access instructions in the following site:<br />http://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrsw/installations/navbase_coronado/om/force_protection/base_access.html</p>
<p>Awardees are highly encourage to enroll in the long-term RAPIDGate pre-vetted base access.  Delayed or failure to perform due to awardee's negligence in ensuring base access will not be permitted as an excusable delay.</p>
<p>The detailed parking instructions will be provided at a later date.</p>
<p>C.2.17 Misuse and Abuse:</p>
<p>Service and parts required due to misuse, abuse, or damage due to external causes beyond the control of the awardee may not be the responsibility of the awardee.   The awardee shall furnish the details of possible misuse to TSB within three business days.  USU TSB shall determine the appropriateness of additional payment and any unresolved disputes will be forwarded to the contracting officer for final determination.</p>

<p>L.3 In-Person Oral Presentation:</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to request an in-person oral presentation as deemed fit.  If oral presentations are requested by the Government, the company must consent to recording the presentation.  The date and location of the presentation will be discussed and determined at a later date.&emsp;<br />M. Evaluation Factors for Award</p>
<p>The Government will award to the responsible vendor(s) whose offer, conforming to this announcement, will be most advantageous to the Government based on best value trade-offs.</p>
<p>The Government is not required to award to the lowest-priced offeror or to the highest technically-rated offeror.  Award(s) will be made to the offeror(s) whose quote(s) is/are technically acceptable and whose Past Performance, Awardee Accountability, Corporate Experience, and Price are the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p>The Government may reject any quotes that have been determined to be unrealistic in terms of price when compared to the Government cost estimate, market research, and other offers.  A quote may also be rejected if the offeror does not display a clear understanding of the requirements or the terms and conditions.</p>
<p>All non-Price evaluation factors when combined are more important than Price.  But as the non-Price evaluation factors are rated more equally among the technically-acceptable offers, the importance of Price will increase.</p>
<p>Evaluation factors are listed in the order of importance, with the most important being listed first:<br />3.1.	Technical,<br />3.2.	Past Performance<br />3.3.	Corporate Experience,<br />3.4.	Awardee Accountability, and<br />3.5.	Price.</p>
<p>Offerors are permitted to submit their standard ("minimal") quote submission.  This standard quote would be a quote that a vendor would typically submit to its Government customers.  Upon the Government's evaluation, as we deem it necessary, we will open dialogues directly with the offerors.</p>
<p>M.1 Technical:</p>
<p>Offerors should, at minimum, describe their technical approach to fulfill the following:<br />M.1.1.	Provide and certify maintenance service in accordance with the OEM specifications and operability;<br />M.1.2.	Provide PMs and/or software updates, if applicable, as described in the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 or Amend 3 attachment;<br />M.1.3.	Available during the Government's normal business hours (Monday through Friday, Federal holidays excluded, from 7:30am ET (0730 hours) to 4:00pm ET (1600 hours));<br />M.1.4.	Sometimes the Government may require service outside the normal business hours listed in M.1.3.  If such service is available, the quote must include the terms, conditions, and the prices for such repairs;<br />M.1.5.	Disclose whether or not a direct telephone access to the service technician/provider is available to USU users.  If not, please propose how you plan to resolve simple, minor inquiries or concerns;<br />M.1.6.	Offer guaranteed response and repair time, including any contingencies;<br />M.1.7.	Issue field service report (FSR) to USU TSB  upon each call and service visit;<br />M.1.8.	Maintain a secure digital log of all services;<br />M.1.9.	Hold all relevant licenses and/or certifications required by the industry as well as applicable laws and regulations;<br />M.1.10.	Offer customer- and industry-relations plan as well as letters of commitment from subcontractors to maintain and improve ongoing relationships to ensure satisfactory performance;<br />M.1.11.	Propose innovative solutions to satisfy the Government's service requirements that we may not have yet considered;<br />M.1.12.	Define all teaming and/or subcontracting plans.  Letters of Commitment from the subcontractors will be evaluated favorably;<br />M.1.13.	Detail how often the software/firmware updates will be deployed and how it will be implemented for those applicable instruments;<br />M.1.14.	Detail the proper lockout/tagout (LOTO) practice and guidelines as well as its training plans of its employees.</p>
<p>Those technical quotes that best fulfills our requirements and most aptly addresses our existing and potential future risks will be rated higher.</p>
<p>M.2 Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government shall evaluate the offerors' present and past performance references.  Offerors must provide three (3) contract/award numbers with Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) reports for similar work performed.  Copies of the entire CPARS evaluation must be provided in the quote package.</p>
<p>If CPARS reports are not available, offerors must provide three (3) references with which the offeror has had performance history in similar complexity and scope as the USU requirement.  The Government reserves the right to select which references to contact.  The following should be provided for each reference:<br />M.2.1.	Name of agency and/or business;<br />M.2.2.	The address of the agency and/or business;<br />M.2.3.	Name of current point-of-contact, including title, phone number, and email address;<br />M.2.4.	Contract/agreement number;<br />M.2.5.	Contract/agreement value;<br />M.2.6.	Contract/agreement period of performance; and<br />M.2.7.	Brief description of the service(s) provided.</p>
<p>The three past performance CPARS reports or references should include at least one internal USU CPARS report or reference if available.</p>
<p>More than three past performance CPARS reports or references will not be considered.  USU may request additional information at any time.</p>
<p>If there were any teaming/subcontracting efforts, the past performance contact must be of the prime entity.</p>
<p>Offerors will have an opportunity to timely address any adverse past performance history.  Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably; instead those offerors will be rated a Neutral/Unknown rating.  Offerors must clearly state in their quote if they do not have at least three past performance references.  Failure to address this information may render an offeror's quote nonresponsive and may not be considered for award by the Government.</p>
<p>A history of relevant strong past performance will be more advantageous to the offeror than a less relevant record of strong performance.  The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternative sources in conducting our assessment of past performance history.</p>
<p>M.3 Corporate Experience:</p>
<p>Offerors must provide a narrative of their experience in providing the same or similar type and complexity of services requested.  In addition, offerors must also describe the following experience:<br />M.3.1.	Experience in providing maintenance services or maintenance management services, including with different types of entity, e.g. Federal Government, state and local government, private companies, hospitals, universities, etc.;<br />M.3.2.	Experience in facilitating emergency service requests and dealing with prolonged, difficult maintenance services;<br />M.3.3.	Experience in executing difference types of Federal Government contracts/agreements, especially FFP and T&amp;M contracts/agreements; and<br />M.3.4.	Experience in servicing various types and brands of equipment.  Offerors should list all the equipment they are able to service.</p>
<p>Those offerors with rich history of related corporate experience will be rated higher.</p>
<p>M.4 Awardee Accountability:</p>
<p>The Government requests the awardee(s) to be accountable of the services they promise to provide.  Offerors must present its quote in good faith and must offer a plan in case the Government receives delayed or unsatisfactory service.  Offerors must present realistic response and repair times.  Offerors may opt to offer voluntary daily credit for delays or failure to render promised services.  These factors will be reflected in this evaluation.  Offerors must detail all contingencies to this plan as they deem necessary.</p>
<p>M.5 Price:</p>
<p>Interested offerors must complete the Equipment Pricing Amend 1 or Amend 3 attachment and submit an electronic copy for award consideration.</p>
<p>Offered prices must include all pertinent cost, including but not limited to parts, labor, travel, and profit.  The total price will be the evaluated price.  Interest offerors are encouraged to offer both FFP and T&amp;M prices for each line of equipment they propose to maintain.  Offers that provide only FFP or T&amp;M prices, but not both, will be considered without prejudice.  Ultimately, the resulting award(s) could contain both FFP and T&amp;M prices for different CLINs.</p>
<p>For T&amp;M pricing, offerors must offer every facet of cost; including how PMs, software/firmware updates, and addition of new instruments will be priced.</p>
<p>USU recognizes that these are commercial services and future fixed prices or labor rates are uncertain; therefore, offerors are encouraged to provide proposed future price adjustment formulas.  It would be wise to peg these formula to your best customer pricing and to explain the deviations from that price, e.g. Government/university discounts.  The proposed price adjustment interval will also be evaluated.</p>

<CONTACT>Loesch, Kimberly
<DESC>AMENDMENT 2 to Notice of Intent to Sole Source

The purpose of Amendment 2 is to re-post Amendment 1 which didn't post correctly.

AMENDMENT 1 to Notice of Intent to Sole Source

The purpose of Amendment 1 is to:
1.	Change the number of days to submit a response from fifteen (15) to seven (7).
2.	Change the response due date from October 1, 2016 to September 23, 2016.
3.	Change the anticipated award date from October 14, 2016 to September 30, 2016.


The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), with Headwall Photonics, Inc. to purchase a hyperspectral camera that is sensitive to Shortwave Infared (SWIR) energy. 

The hyperspectral camera is intended to be installed in an aircraft photographic reconnaissance pod consisting of multiple sensors and will be operated autonomously through a Headwall Photonics controlling computer.  The minimum specifications for the hyperspectral camera are as follows:
*	Camera detectors sensitive to the electromagnetic energy range of 900-2,500 nanometers (SWIR);
*	Camera shall be compatible with the current EPA owned and operated remote sensing system which uses Headwall Photonics hardware and software;
*	Camera shall have no less than 160 separate and continuous spectral channels;
*	Camera shall have no less than 300 separate and continuous spatial channels;
*	Imager shall have aberration-corrected grating;
*	Instrument shall be capable of utilizing interchangeable lens;
*	Instrument weight and power must not exceed 10 lbs and 15 Watts;
*	The camera shall have a 17.7 mm F/L C-mount SWIR Lens:  F/2.5, telecentric 900-2500nm;
*	Shall have shutter assembly for Micro-Hyperspec-SWIR sensor;
*	Radiometric Calibration;
*	Upgrade to existing EPA owned Compact Hyperspectral Data Processing Unit to 1TB solid state hard disk drive, retest and integration with Hyperspectral Camera.

The EPA has identified Headwall Photonics, Inc. as the only contractor able to meet the requirements of this procurement.  Headwall Photonics, Inc. is the only vendor that offers a Hyperspectral Camera that:  (1) is compatible with the Headwall hardware and software which is currently owned and in use by the EPA; (2) has aberration-corrected grating.  None of the other equipment identified during market research met all of these requirements. 

This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13 Procedures.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  Any firm that is capable of meeting EPAs requirement as set forth above may submit a response; which, if received within seven (7) calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be reviewed for consideration.  A determination not to compete the described requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this posting must be submitted via the FedConnect website at https://www.fedconnect.net.  Mail, fax, phone and email submissions shall not be accepted.  One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to Free Trade Agreements.  EPA anticipates that award will be made by September 30, 2016.
