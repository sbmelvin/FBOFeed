<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for an upgrade to an existing government owned high-precision photogrammetry camera named INCA 1 to the latest version. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Geodetic Services Inc. (GSI) who is the only known responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  The existing INCA1 camera is a custom design by GSI.  This camera is a key tool in an existing research project.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to customize the existing equipment and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 13, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) is interested in evaluating the extent and type(s) of evidence-based federal and state health care reforms and changes for people with disabilities, in both the private and public sectors, which make health care more consumer driven and include some of the following features: a) adequate information to empower consumers to make informed decisions when choosing a health plan or provider; b) quality standards (e.g., health care report cards) that are developed in collaboration with people with disabilities and are responsive to the clinical and information needs of consumers with disabilities; c) adequate appeals and grievance processes to enable consumers to challenge health plans and health provider decisions, including arbitration mechanisms, ombudsmen independent of health plans, and private rights of action; and, d) consumer governance in which consumers and purchasers, not providers and payers, dominate the governing of the health care system through purchasing cooperatives and various oversight mechanisms.

To that end, NCD is interested in funding a study and conducting research to address the following main items related to the issue of consumer-oriented health care within the context of Medicare/Medicaid reform as it relates to Americans with disabilities. NCD is interested in looking at a range of practices or programs that may represent the extent of best-evidence to emerging-evidence of effectiveness in terms of results or outcomes for consumers. The estimated contract period of performance is 10 months.  

NCD will distribute its Consumer-Oriented Health Care Requests for Proposals (RFPs) to interested parties on December 16, 2002. NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by February 3, 2003. 

Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up at NCD on or after the issue date. All requests must reference the RFP number and title. For more information, contact Martin Gould, mgould@ncd.gov, 1331 F Street, NW, Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004; 202-272-2004 or 202-272-2074 TTY.

<DESC>The proposed contract listed here is an 8(a) Competitive procurement.  North American Industrial Classification (NAIC) is 233320, Standard industrial code is 1542 and the size standard is $28.5 million. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Agency.  The project consist of renovating approximately 46,000 SF, approximately 16,00 SF for the clinic and 15,000 SF for the assisted living units, within the Scott Building that consists of 350,000 SF.  The Scott Building is mainly a dormitory building with 648 single rooms each with an attached bath and a walk-in closet.  For the clinic, the primary objective is to renovate some of the existing single rooms into outpatient facilities consisting of Reception/Administration, Primary Care, Urgent/Treatment, Dental, Eye, and Outreach Services.  For the assisted living, the primary objective is to renovate some of the existing rooms into handicap accessible rooms.  This will be accomplished by combining approximately 90 existing rooms into approximately 60 new enlarged accessible, assisted living rooms.  Some other existing rooms will be for administrative and recreational spaces to support the assisted living units.  The mechanical and electrical infrastructure for the renovated area is existing and located in the basement of the building.  Therefore, the installation of new plumbing, air conditioning, heating, electrical and communication systems are required to be tied into the existing building distribution systems. The existing building is eight stories high; only one-half of the first three floors will be occupied and functioning; therefore, minimizing the disruptions of the existing utilities, dust and noise control are required.   The entire Scott building was renovated in 1989, which included asbestos and lead paint removal and /or abatement.  Asbestos may still be encountered in enclosed existing pipe chases, which may be required to be abated prior to any pipe connections.  The project will be designed with commercial codes and standards.  The facility must meet the UF AS and ADA, as well as the Guidelines for Design and Construction of Hospital and Health Care Facilities requirements.  AFRH staff will administer the contract. As an element of the design-build entity, professional architects and engineers experienced in the design of similar facilities who are registered in the District of Columbia will be required to oversee all aspects of the design and construction of the Scott Clinic and Assisted Living Renovation Project.  Design submittals will be required at the 35%, 60%, and 90% design stages.  The 100% submittal will be the as-built drawings.  Informal partnering will be employed throughout the design and construction phases of the project.  Evaluation factors below will be used during evaluation process, but are not listed in order of importance: General Design-Build Contractor Management Structure and Organization; General Contractor Relevant Experience and Past Performance; General Contractor Key Personnel; Design Contractor Qualifications. Estimated cost of proposed acquisition is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. Period of performance is 300 calendar days from date of Notice to Proceed. Contract type is Firm Fixed Price. Issuance o/a 11 September 2002; receipt of proposals o/a 16 October 2002

This Sustainment Support will play an important role improving the safety and survivability of ammunition items in the tactical area.

This solicitation is contemplated as a sole source procurement with Altarum Institute because of their demonstrated understanding of the relationships and required integration between the processes involved in program and acquisition management, software acquisition management, systems engineering methodologies and business process reengineering. Altarum possesses the unique capabilities required for the project and has over one year experience supporting the requirement. Period of performance is anticipated to be 3 months from date of award.  Given the short anticipated time frame for completion of this contract, three months, it would add cost and time for a new contractor unfamiliar with processes, documentation and progress to date. . This contract is to be performed in the Washington DC metropolitan area and may involve travel outside the area. Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Altarum Institute, Park Center Office, 4401 Ford Ave., Suite 800, Alexandria, VA 22302, (703)-575-1200.

<DESC>Title: Performance Based Logistics Contract for Depot Level and full OEM logistics support. Description:  The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) intends to negotiate a sole source performance based logistics contract with Rockwell Collins, 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 52498, for depot level and full OEM support for the following items that are associated with the H-1/H-46 aircraft platform: 01-417-2680		822-0777-001		Interface 01-263-1458		622-5646-002		Electronic Component 01-399-4359		622-9019-001		Control Unit 01-400-3624		622-9018-001		Computer, Set 01-447-6014		622-8149-031		Receiver-Transmitter 01-470-4153		822-0820-002		Interface Control 01-452-8949		822-0850-001		Display Unit The primary goals of the program are to support fleet readiness and to reduce total life cycle cost.  This firm fixed priced contract requires performance of repair/re place/overhaul requirements, inventory reporting and requisition processing, availability/fill rate and response time metrics, program management, and logistic support in a responsive and timely manner for seven items for up to five years.  This performance-based contract is FOB destination.  Rockwell Collins is the original equipment manager (OEM) for the specified parts listed above.  The items are highly specialized parts, designed and manufactured by a non-government activity and the technical data required for management, repair, and reliability improvement by other than above is not available.  The only source who currently has the capability and the technical data is Rockwell-Collins and is, therefore, the only source that possesses the requisite technical knowledge and technical data to perform the work requirements with the time required to meet Navy requirements.  The  U. S. Government does not own full data rights for these 7 H-1/H-46 items. Place of Performance: Cedar Rapids, Iowa Postal Code: 52498 Country: USA

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (NSWCDD CSS), Panama City, Florida, 32407-7001 intends to award a Purchase Order to Scott Health and Safety, 4320 Goldmine Road, Monroe, North Carolina 28110, on a sole source basis, for 300/ea Universal Charging Wands. The charging wands are not compatible with other SCBA units; therefore, this acquisition is not suitable for full and open competition. It is estimated that re-procuring for SCBA units would cost the U.S. Navy hundreds of thousands of dollars and would take several months to complete, thus significantly delaying delivery to the fleet. NAICS Code 339113 applies.  SBA Size standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The Combat Direction Systems Activity, Dahlgren Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center intends to procure support of AN/UYQ-70 and legacy combat systems on a Sole Source basis from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Naval Electronics & Surveillance Systems, Tactical Systems, 3333 Pilot Knob Road, Eagan, MN 55121.   Services and supplies to support AN/UYQ-70 deployed systems and legacy systems for which Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems is the Original Equipment Manufacturer will include technology development, system groom and audits, design, specification development, test and evaluation, certification, operation, overhaul, restoration, maintenance, improvement/modernization, and field technical support.  In addition, the contractor will supply technology insertion, training, configuration management, spares, help/hot lines, electronic documentation, and web based support for AN/UYQ-70  deployed hardware.  The support will also include all aspects of hardware, software and field support services required for data systems engineering and operations support, and intelligence and electronic warfare support. Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems is the only know source with the knowledge, experience and resources to perform the work that will be required by the Government.  As the original equipment manufacturer of both the legacy combat systems and the Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS) based AN/UYQ-70 Combat System, they are the only firm that can provide a seamless transition from the current legacy systems to the COTS based systems.  LM Tactical Systems has also developed unique resources and tools to access systems' configuration data.  Therefore, the Government would incur substantial costs and systems support delays in attempting to develop alternate sources. The Combat Direction Systems Activity or designated ordering activity will place multiple orders against Basic Ordering Agreement N63273-02-G-0001 for a one-year period. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems directly.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Data Procurement Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Dr. Sherif Ismail, Executive Deputy Chairman, Egyptian Petrochemical Holding Company (Echem), 3 El Mokhayam El Dayem Street, Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt, Phone: (20-2) 263-4000, Fax:  (20-2) 263-1010  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study for a proposed propane dehydrogenation plant in Egypt.

The Egyptian Petrochemical Holding Company (Echem) was established in February 2002 by the Ministry of Petroleum to manage existing publicly held assets and equities in the chemical/petrochemical industry.  Echem is mandated to identify and develop new petrochemical and chemical production opportunities in cooperation with its sister parastatal organizations such as the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and the Egyptian Gas Holding Company (EGAS), as well as private companies and investors.

Propane, which is typically derived from liquids associated with natural gas production, is the feedstock for the production of polypropylene and a variety of other polymers.  Propylene is created through the removal of hydrogen from the propane molecule.  This process is called propane dehydrogenation (PDH).  In September 2002, Echem completed a preliminary study to evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of producing propylene using the PDH process.  Based on this study, Echem found that building a new 350,000 metric tons per annum (mta) PDH plant near the new port at Ain El-Sukhna would be feasible.  EGAS has agreed to deliver 430,000 mta of propane to the proposed facility and the Oriental Petroleum Company, a private Egyptian firm, is expected to be the primary offtaker for the project.

One of the primary variables in this project is the supply-demand balance of propylene in the region.  Although supplies of propylene are presently limited, additional production is expected to create a surplus within the next few years leading to lower prices.  Lower regional prices could make it economically preferable for Egypt to import propylene rather than produce propylene from propane.  EGAS has agreed to index the propane price to the propylene product price, which will minimize the propylene price risk due to world market cycles.  In addition, EGAS will provide guarantees for the propane supply rate, and specifications, further enhancing the project’s risk profile.

The objective of the study is to investigate the technical, marketing, economic, environmental and financing viability of manufacturing 350,000 mta of propylene from 430,000 mta of Egyptian propane feedstock.  The tasks for the study are summarized as follows:

Task A:  Feedstock Assessment
Task B:  Marketing Assessment
Task C:  Site Selection
Task D:  Technology and Technical Evaluation
Task E:  Preliminary Environmental and Safety Assessment
Task F:  Project Cost Estimation
Task G:  Financial Analysis
Task H:  Final Report to Echem and USTDA

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $253,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  The study has been estimated by USTDA to cost US$506,000.  In addition to the USTDA grant funding of US$253,000, the Grantee will cover the remaining costs required to complete the full terms of reference.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m. local Egyptian time on Tuesday, May 27, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Statement of Work				5/9/03

	35MM Digital Motion Picture Film Recorder

C.1.  Background

	C.1.1  The Library of Congress Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division operates a full service motion picture conservation center located on Wright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton Ohio. The Conservation Center consists of two units, the Film Vaults (building 167, area B) and the Preservation Laboratory (building 682, area B). 

	C.1.2  The primary purpose of the Center is to conserve, preserve, and restore the Library's film archive, the largest of its kind in the United States. 

	C.1.3  Among the many discreet collections that form the main body of the archive, resides the Paper Print Collection; a landmark copyright deposit of 1894 to 1915 era motion pictures printed on positive photographic paper.

	C.1.4  Due to inadequate copyright provisions for moving images in 1894, the Library of Congress pressed existing still photography registration requirements onto the new medium of motion pictures when Thomas Edison attempted to copyright his first commercial motion picture, "The Sneeze".   

	C.1.5  Paper prints are contact or optically printed, photographic-paper positives of early Silent-era motion pictures.   As such, these paper prints exhibit a large number of physical characteristics similar to standard motion picture film but are different in the following ways:

	•	The prints are opaque and do not readily pass light.
	•	The paper base can be fragile and easily broken by excessive tension or sudden force.  
	•	All paper prints are monochrome (to the best of our knowledge).
	•	The prints may be perforated with Edison, B&H negative perforations OR not perforated at all.
	•	The surface texture of paper prints vary from extremely glossy and smooth to very matte with heavy paper texture exhibited by the image.
	•	The "weight" or strength of paper print can vary considerably, and certain characteristics are usually associated with a particular studio (i.e., Biograph prints are usually very glossy, heavy weight paper prints, whereas Edison prints are very thin, light paper prints that impart a heavy paper texture into the image).	
	•	The actual width of each paper print can vary considerably from the standard from which it was copied; slitting accuracy was not maintained to modern standards.


	C.1.6.  In the past 60 years since their re-discovery in a basement closet in the Library of Congress, these paper prints have been copied repeatedly with less than acceptable results.  While the final attempt to re-master these prints to 35MM motion picture film with a computer controlled, custom optical printer proved the most effective of all attempts, the result still left much to be desired in proper image steadiness and registration.

	C.1.7  With recent gains in digital restoration technique, it has been determined that the current method of copying should be halted and a digital solution be found to implement a final campaign to copy these unique artifacts to an archival media with damage and registration correction tools to ensure ultimate image quality.
	
C.2.  Scope

The purpose of this contract is to purchase one (1) new digital film recorder to establish a digital to film restoration chain at the Motion Picture Conservation Center in Dayton, Ohio.  

	C.2.1.  This recorder shall be an element in a complete digital restoration chain that is comprised of a digital scanner with restoration computer workstation and appropriate software,  and a suitable 35MM motion picture film recorder.
	
C.3.  General Requirements

	The Contractor shall build, deliver, install, test, and certify for use by the Film Laboratory one (1) new motion picture film recorder. Contractor shall warranty the supplied equipment and installation for a minimum of one (1) year after the certification for use is completed.	

C.4.  Specific Requirements

	The contractor shall supply a 35MM motion picture film recorder that has the following specific characteristics. Characteristics should be considered mandatory for compliance, except as noted. Options should be priced separately and clearly labeled as optional:

	C.4.2. The film recorder shall include a mounted 35MM motion picture camera head with a 4 (four) perforation stroke movement of the pin-registered variety, a quick change dual chamber film magazine of no less than 2,000 foot capacity,  and optionally, provision for accepting a 16mm pin-registered movement and magazine to print directly to 16mm film stock.

	C.4.3.  The film recorder shall have provision for outputting to film both 1:33 to 1 Academy and 1:37 to 1 Full Aperture 35MM aspect ratios as specified in current SMPTE specifications literature.  Other optional formats and aspect ratios are desired , but not required
	
	C.4.3. The film recorder shall be capable of outputting to color or monochrome film stock and  the appropriate color and monochrome LUTs (look up tables) shall be supplied by the manufacturer for the following film stocks (all 35MM format):

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 003, for vendors interested in providing a Hydraulic press brake is to address and answer questions requested by vendors. The Request for Quotations (RFQ) due date is changed to April 21, 2003 at 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. The following questions were asked by vendors: Question: 1.  BEP’s requirements list a Y axis adjustment of 8”.  Please advise if you would accept a Y axis adjustment of 6.3”. Answer: BEP has requested specific criteria in our Statement of Work (SOW) based on our needs, we plan on using “C” type multi-punching tools in our brake. Y axis adjustment may be critical to accepting this tooling. Question: 2.  BEP’s requirements list a “tilting gauge bar” in Paragraph H on page two.  What we would look to provide is the X, Y, and R axes to include flip-up type stops on the back gauge bar to prevent damage to the gauging device when bending certain types of parts.  In addition to this flip-up feature, we also have a retract pinch point which can be engaged at the control by the operator based on the type of work that is being performed.  Answer: BEP’s intent is to prevent damage to our gauging device.  However, BEP has had operations that required fade-out. Question: 3. Will BEP accept fax bid submissions? If so, to what number can we fax our bid? Answer: As spelled out in the original electronic posting, quotations may be mailed to the BEP Office of Procurement, Attn: Christina Tayman, 14th and C Sts,S.W., Washington, D.C. 20228-0001 or faxed to Christina Tayman at (202) 874-2200 or (202) 874-3235. If you have any further questions, please contact Christina Tayman at the address above or by e-mail toChristina.tayman@bep.treas.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored.All responsible sources may submit an offer upon receipt of the RFQ,which, shall be considered by the Agency.  4.  Modifications 001 and 002 do not appear as documented amendments for signature.  Please confirm if this is the case because the RFQ document shows a closing date of April 3, 2003? Answer: Per Amendment 002, the RFP due date for RFQ-03-0303 was extended to April 17, 2003 at 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. You will be able to obtain copies of all Standard Forms 18 off the Electronic Posting System at www.eps.gov . Please download these forms, sign and date them, and submit with a copy of your quote.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 003, for vendors interested in providing a Hydraulic press brake is to address and answer questions requested by vendors. The Request for Quotations (RFQ) due date is changed to April 21, 2003 at 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. The following questions were asked by vendors: Question: 1.  BEP’s requirements list a Y axis adjustment of 8”.  Please advise if you would accept a Y axis adjustment of 6.3”. Answer: BEP has requested specific criteria in our Statement of Work (SOW) based on our needs, we plan on using “C” type multi-punching tools in our brake. Y axis adjustment may be critical to accepting this tooling. Question: 2.  BEP’s requirements list a “tilting gauge bar” in Paragraph H on page two.  What we would look to provide is the X, Y, and R axes to include flip-up type stops on the back gauge bar to prevent damage to the gauging device when bending certain types of parts.  In addition to this flip-up feature, we also have a retract pinch point which can be engaged at the control by the operator based on the type of work that is being performed.  Answer: BEP’s intent is to prevent damage to our gauging device.  However, BEP has had operations that required fade-out. Question: 3. Will BEP accept fax bid submissions? If so, to what number can we fax our bid? Answer: As spelled out in the original electronic posting, quotations may be mailed to the BEP Office of Procurement, Attn: Christina Tayman, 14th and C Sts,S.W., Washington, D.C. 20228-0001 or faxed to Christina Tayman at (202) 874-2200 or (202) 874-3235. If you have any further questions, please contact Christina Tayman at the address above or by e-mail toChristina.tayman@bep.treas.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored.All responsible sources may submit an offer upon receipt of the RFQ,which, shall be considered by the Agency.  4.  Modifications 001 and 002 do not appear as documented amendments for signature.  Please confirm if this is the case because the RFQ document shows a closing date of April 3, 2003? Answer: Per Amendment 002, the RFP due date for RFQ-03-0303 was extended to April 17, 2003 at 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. You will be able to obtain copies of all Standard Forms 18 off the Electronic Posting System at www.eps.gov . Please download these forms, sign and date them, and submit with a copy of your quote.

Answer: For those vendors that chose not to attend the formal site visit on April 2, 2003 starting 9:30 A.M. to 11:30 P.M. please be advised the final position of the machine is all on one level.

<CONTACT>Stephanie Krogman, 309-782-3273
<DESC>NA The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Research is to identify potential sources capable of operating, maintaining and performing upgrades to the Army War Reserve Deployment System (AWRDS)/Automated Battlebook System (ABS) for CONUS and OCONUS sites by 1 Nov 03.     AWRDS is an automated system designed to assist in the accountability, inventory, and transfer of prepositioned stock from the Army Field Support Command (AFSC) to the designated Army units during a contingency, exercise, or as directed by Department of Ar my.  AWRDS is operated at all AFSC storage sites including the prepositioned ships.  It is capable of supporting the rapid military deployments anywhere in the world.  A prospective contractor must accomplish the following using AWRDS/ABS:  Maintain a data base of APS stock and equipment data in a unit set configuration for deployment; Provide visibility into containers, vehicles, trailers, and multi pack items on a real time basis in the form of reports, listings or data sets for hand receipt preparation; Use bar code/RF Tag technology to collect equipment data, track location of equipment and maintain changes in cargo configuration; Provide an automated Port of Debarkation (POD) handoff to the Army Warfighter with the electronic production of hand receipt documents and data files to populate the warfighters Standard Army Information Systems (STAMIS);  Provide equipment on-hand and serviceability data for readiness reporting capabilities in accordance with AR 220-1;  Track equipment at the Unit Identificatio n Code (UIC)/National Stock Number (NSN)/Serial Number level and link accountability of secondary loads to the primary vehicle;  and provide system interfaces to the Standard Depot System (SDS), the Army Logistics Integrated Data Base (LIDB), the STAMISs, Standard Property Book System (SPBS-R), Property Book Unit Supply Supply-Enhanced (PBUS-E), Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS), Unit Level Logistic System (ULLS), and Standard Army Maintenance System (SAMS); provide monthly submissions of DA Form 2 406 data to Readiness Integrated Data Base (RIDB); and provide Transportation Control and Movement Document (TCMD) data submissions to the Worldwide Port System (WPS). ABS supports the Army Prepositioned Stocks (APS) deployment planning by providing the Army Warfighter a user friendly, seamless, front end interface with AWRDS and to provide deployment planning information integrated from several sources.  It provides the  Army warfighter a tool to obtain a current battlebook via CD ROM or on the Internet via Army Electronic Products (AEPS) at home or in a deployed status with visibility of APS assets to influence force building and unit set management.  ABS is comprised of  a preposition status module, equipment view module, battlebook section module, and linker view module.  It contains equipment on-hand data; Modified Table of Equipment (MTOE) authorizations; Authorized Stockage List (ASL)/Prescribed Load List (PLL) requir ements, operational projects authorizations/requirements; hand-off procedures (coordinated with 3rd Army and the applicable theater); and ship data from the Military Sealift Command for the afloat mission. It allows for hard copy or screen presentation at the users personal computer and the ability to download data to spreadsheets and databases for the Army warfighterÃ¢Â€Â™s planning purposes.  A respondent to this market survey must have specific capabilities required to support the critical AWRDS/ABS system that operates on Sybase.  The requirement specifies there are approximately 30 on-site support personnel required to be distributed at vari ous OCONUS sites.  There is a requirement to support contingency operations, and at the critical time during Iraqi Freedom, 42 people deployed.   Interested firms who feel they are capable of providing AWRDS/ABS support, are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief description of facilities, capabilities,  personnel, and past experience as it relates to the above criteria.  Information may be submitted to:  HQ, AFSC, ATTN: SJMFS-CCA, Linda Lueders, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL   61299-6000.  Please respond NO LATER THAN 27 May 03 and identify Ã¢Â€ ÂœAWRDS/ABS Sources Sought/Market ResearchÃ¢Â€Â as the subject of your response.  This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government do es not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the Natural Gas and Wastewater infrastructure systems at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. The base size is approximately 4,524,064 square feet, which includes 365 buildings and 874 military family housing units. Luke has its own wastewater treatment plant. The natural gas distribution system: Natural Gas is supplied to Luke Air Force Base at three separate locations by 175 pound per square inch gauge gas mains owned by Southwest Gas Corporation. The natural gas piping on the main base is almost entirely polyethylene (PE). Steel piping is located in the Military Family Housing area. The piping is coated, rather than wrapped, and includes a cathodic protection system. The system contains 19 rectifiers. There is no physical on-base production of gas or natural gas wells. The meters owned by the Air Force are used for billing purposes. The Air Force-owned distribution system consists of approximately 119,000 linear feet of underground piping. The majority of the piping is less than 20 years old, with some as old as 50 years. The wastewater system at Luke Air Force Base consists of three major components, the sanitary sewer collection system, the wastewater treatment plant, and non-potable water reuse system. The sanitary sewer system consists of the gravity mains, cleanouts, lift stations, force mains, and access manholes associated with the collection of sanitary sewer from the facility buildings and family housing on the base. A majority of the gravity collection mains and service laterals were installed in the 1940’s when the base was first constructed and in the 1950’s and 1960. The gravity collection mains installed during these construction periods are composed primarily of Reinforced Concrete Pipe, the force mains are Cast Iron, and the service laterals are Vitrified Clay Pipe. In the late 1970’s, additional base housing was installed. The gravity collection mains installed during these construction periods are composed primarily of Reinforced Concrete Pipe, the force mains are Cement Mortar Lined Ductile Iron, and the service laterals are Vitrified Clay Pipe. Since the 1980’s, the base has made a concerted effort to install PVC for all sanitary sewer piping that are 8 inches or less. Consequently, most of the gravity mains, force mains, and service laterals in these areas are composed of PVC. A majority of the gravity collection mains, force mains and service laterals installed during the 1940’s, 1950’s and 1960’s are in fair to good condition. A majority of the gravity collection mains, force mains and service laterals installed in the 1970’s, 1980’s and 1990’s are in good to excellent condition. The wastewater treatment plant is designed to accept all of the sanitary flow from the sanitary sewer collection system through a 21-inch reinforced concrete pipe main gravity line flowing from the site. Major improvements were conducted in 1994 to provide an advanced wastewater treatment plant that consistently met effluent discharge limitations and provided reuse water for discharge to the base golf course ad parks for irrigation purposes. Improvements were designed to allow the facility to effectively treat an average daily flow of 1 million gallons per day with removal efficiencies in excess of 95% or better for Biochemical Oxygen Demand and suspended solids. The wastewater treatment plant has a certified laboratory capable of performing both process control and process monitoring tests. Since most of the wastewater treatment plant equipment was installed or reconstructed in the 1994 improvements, its overall condition is good to excellent. The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  At this time, no solicitation exists: therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. Vendors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought including, commercial market information and company information via e-mail or facsimile (703-767-2382) to Mily Le, no later than May 27, 2003.  Responses should include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone number and e-mail address; business size and disadvantaged, 8(a) or HUBZone status; corporate affiliations; potential joint venture partners, teaming partners, and or major subcontractor or (prime).  Please direct any questions or concerns to the Contract Specialist for this action:  Bobby Jones Robert.E.Jones@dla.mil

<SUBJECT>A--ENGINEERING CAPABILITIES FOR AIRBREATHING PROPULSION, APPLIED TO FUTURE SPACE LAUNCH VEHICLES
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop technology proposals in response to the announcement below. Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) on March 24, 2003 soliciting government-led proposals in propulsion research and technology in support of NASA's Next Generation Launch Technology Program (NGLTP). This NRA is being executed in parallel with NRA-03-GRC-PRT-01, soliciting industry-led proposals.  Both announcements solicit proposals to advance technologies for airbreathing and combined-cycle propulsion systems in the following categories: rotating seals and components, propulsion flowpath components and engineering capability development.  Successful proposals must present topics that advance Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) and address technical performance metrics derived from assessments of candidate reusable launch vehicle (RLV) vision vehicle concepts. Vision vehicle concepts include single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicles powered by rocket-based combined-cycle (RBCC) and turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) propulsion systems as well as two-stage to-orbit (TSTO) systems powered by high-Mach gas turbine engines and rocket or RBCC engines. Technical performance metrics are derived from requirements that enable system functionality or provide increased weight and performance margin to reduce the cost and enhance the safety of future RLV systems. The NGLT program will competitively select, through a peer review process, proposals to participate in the program. The total proposed period of performance should not exceed 36 months.  NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the NGLT program to develop proposals for propulsion research and technology in the area of engineering capability development, as described further in the 5 proposal descriptions given below.  Proposal topics may include investigations of ramjet combustion physics, development of advanced test instrumentation for RBCC and TBCC propulsion systems, advanced modeling capabilities, and wide operating range design tools and databases. This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA for government led proposals. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to perform research activities consistent with the efforts synopsized for the LaRC proposals. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential government, industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1)	  Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel:	This criteria evaluates the proposer's relevant recent experience, past performance in similar research activities, technical capability to perform the research, and key personnel available to support the research.  Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2)      Facilities and capabilities. This criterion evaluates the proposer's facilities and research capabilities (testing and analysis) to conduct the proposed research task. The proposers should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. (3)        Cost and schedule control. This criteria evaluates the proposer's ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar programs or provide evidence of management processes in this area.  Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12-point font) and address each of the criteria. All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Cindy W. Albertson, Mail Stop 168, 12 Langley Boulevard, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via electronic mail to: c.w.albertson@larc.nasa.gov. The due date for submission is COB May 23, 2003. Technical questions should be addressed to the technical points of contact identified in the proposal synopses given below. Procurement questions should be directed to Mary Jane Yeager, NASA LaRC, Office of Procurement, 757-864-2473.  Partners selected under this synopsis will participate in the development of government-led proposals in response to the NRA dated March 24, 2003.  The technical requirements and NASA LaRC points of contact for technical questions are provided for each technology proposal: 1. Over/Under Inlet Performance and Integration for TBCC Engines Technical Point of Contact: Dr. Saied Emami, Ph: 757-864-8326, email: s.emami@larc.nasa.gov  The objective of this effort is to establish performance relationships between high and low speed inlet configurations for TBCC propulsion systems for future space launch vehicles.  Inlet performance and operability will be characterized through wind tunnel experiments of a parametric TBCC inlet configuration. Langley is seeking partners with which to collaborate on TBCC inlet geometry and optimization, based on experimental results.	The partner(s) must work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners to perform this task. 2. Mach 3-5 DMSJ Isolator Operability/Modeling.	Technical Point of Contact: Dr. Aaron Auslender, Ph: 757-864-6545, email: a.h.auslender@larc.nasa.gov The technical objective of this task is to obtain ramjet data, both in the started and unstarted modes of engine operation, for the enhancement of isolator performance prediction capabilities and associated inlet design issues. Primarily, this effort will focus on combustor inlet interaction mechanisms utilizing engine configurations applicable to NASA-NGLT missions. Classified hardware and ITAR restricted analysis techniques will be employed to further the TRL of this operational regime. Partnerships are sought having a demonstrated experimental and analytic expertise in this general discipline.  The partner(s) must work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the tasks described above. 3. Mach 3-5 RBCC and TBCC Combustor Performance and Associated Flow Diagnostics and Analysis Technical Point of Contact: Mr. Diego Capriotti, Ph: 757-864-6200, email: d.p.capriotti@larc.nasa.gov The objectives of this effort are to investigate the use of surrogate gaseous fuels in place of heated JP7 fuel, and to develop scaling parameters to correlate existing hydrogen fuel combustion data with newer JP7 fuel combustion data.  A parametric investigation will be conducted in the NASA Langley Direct Connect Supersonic Combustion Test Facility (DCSCTF) using a combustor model at simulated flight enthalpies associated with flight at Mach 3, 4, and 5.  The combustor model will be fueled with heated liquid JP7, gaseous hydrogen, and gaseous ethylene.  Comparison and analyses of the performance of the combustor with the different fuels at the different test conditions will be conducted. Langley is seeking partners with which to collaborate on the analyses of the acquired experimental data.  Analyses could include (1) quasi-one-dimensional engineering analysis, (2) full three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation, and (3) any innovative analytic techniques.  The partner(s) must work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the tasks described above. 4. Flow Diagnostics and Analysis Tool Development for Combined Cycle Engines Technical Point of Contact: Dr. J. Philip Drummond, Ph: 757-864-2298, email: j.p.drummond@larc.nasa.gov The objective of this task is to develop a database for the design of wide operating range propulsion systems and components including combustors and nozzles.  The database will be used to develop models for turbulence and combustion to be incorporated into CFD codes used in the design of supersonic/hypersonic engine flow paths.  In particular, these CFD codes will be used to design rocket based combined cycle (RBCC) and turbine based combined cycle (TBCC) engine flow paths and individual components for these engine types.  This effort will be conducted with the goal of raising the TRL of the turbulence and combustion modeling aspects of the CFD codes. Langley is seeking partners that will collaborate in the development of experiments from which the required database can be produced and in the development of turbulence and chemistry models from the database to be used in CFD design codes.  The partner(s) must work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the tasks defined above. 5. Combustion Characterization of Catalytically-Cracked Hydrocarbon Scramjet Fuels	Technical Point of Contact: Dr. Gerald Pellett, Ph: 757-864-6241, email: g.l.pellett@larc.nasa.gov The objective of this task is to characterize catalytically cracked dual mode scramjet hydrocarbon fuels in terms of speciation and flameholding potential.  Part of this task will focus on the development of an ambient-temperature fuel composition that mimics cracked-fuel combustion and can be assessed numerically using available chemical kinetics.  Flame holding potential will be characterized using an Opposed Jet Burner (OBJ) system to be developed as part of this effort.  Speciation will be determined from grab samples that will be analyzed for major constituents. Langley is seeking partners to analyze the grab samples for major constituents. The partner(s) must work collaboratively with government representatives and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the tasks defined above.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only  solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number PR-CI-03-10687 is issued as a Request for Quotation. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and  clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-07. This acquisition is processed using full and open competition. The NAICS code is 334516. The contractor(s) shall provide, install and warrant a research-grade Raman spectrometer and laser that includes the following features, and which meets the following minimum performance specifications and requirements.  One contractor shall supply all of the following components, with the possible exception of the laser.  Because the requested laser is higher power than is standard with most commercial Raman systems, we will allow the laser system (only) to be provided by a second contractor. I	LASER 		The Raman system shall function with a 532 nm continuous-wave laser that will also be acquired under this acquisition.  The laser shall be an all-solid-state, diode-pumped, frequency-doubled Nd:YVO4 laser.  The laser power shall be continuously variable from 100 mW (or less) to at least 5W.  The laser shall be supplied either by the contractor that provides the Raman system or by a separate contractor.  If supplied by a separate contractor, the Raman-system supplier shall first supply the Raman excitation fiber only.  The laser supplier shall then install the laser and demonstrate successful injection into the fiber.  Then, the Raman-system supplier shall install the remainder of the Raman system. 		a.	Our Raman application requires the collection of spectra of a single chemical over a long period of time (i.e., days).  We must be able to quantify very small changes (wavelength and intensity) in spectra as a function of our independent variables (e.g., pH, temperature, and ionic strength).  Changes in laser frequency will be observed in our spectra and misinterpreted as real chemical changes. Even very small changes of this type introduce large error in our experiments.  Therefore, the laser shall exhibit true single-frequency output (as opposed to being multimode). The linewidth shall be < 5 MHz measured at 50 msec duration.  The output beam shall be TEM00 spatial mode.  The output beam polarization ratio shall be > 100:1. 		b.	All anticipated uses of the laser (Raman and other measurements) require very low noise and very high stability.  The published and verified specifications of the laser shall be:  				1) optical noise: <0.02% root mean square (rms) over the range of (no greater than)10 Hz to (no less than) 1GHz 				2) power stability: no greater than ? 1 % measured over a 2-hour period, after a warm-up time of less than 30 mins 				3) pointing stability: < 5  rad/ C measured as far-field x and y positions over at least 10 C temperature change (near room temperature) after a warmup time of less than 1 hour 		c.	The beam diameter shall be no greater than 2.3 mm ? 10% at 1/e2 points measured at the exit port.  The full-angle beam divergence shall be <0.5 mrad. 		d.	Because of limited laboratory space and the potential need to move equipment, the laser head shall be less than 20" L x 10" W x 6" H and weigh less than 25 lbs. 		e.	To minimize cost of ownership and downtime, the laser shall use only one diode bar.  It must be practical for the end-user (a properly trained research scientist) to replace the diode on-site without disturbing the experimental setup. 		d.	The laser shall be warranted, at a minimum, for 1 year or 5000 hours. 		f.	The laser shall be a product-line instrument which has a user base and performance track-record of not less than 5 units sold, installed by the supplier, and in operation within the last year.  The laser shall not be a prototype nor test model. II	SPECTROMETER 	It is critical that the sensitivity of the Raman spectrometer allow us to record spectra at the stated concentration, in the stated time.  Also, because spectra will be used to identify unknown species, spectra shall be accurately frequency-calibrated and collected with correct intensity ratios. Therefore the following features are required. 	a.	For the required sensitivity it is critical that the spectrometer have very high throughput.  Because, the f  number of common fiber optics is 2.0, the spectrometer shall have an f  number less than 2.0. 	b.	Because spectra are to be collected as a function of pH and temperature, it is critical that spectra be acquired rapidly.  Also, because spectra will be used to differentiate between similar species, it is critical that high resolution, highly-reproducible, full scan spectra be acquired.  Therefore, we require that spectra from 100 to 4400 cm-1 be collected at 5 cm-1 resolution (for a CCD with 26 micron pixels) in a single camera exposure, without rotating the grating or otherwise moving any physical parts (other than an optical shutter).  Also, we require that the point spread function of the spectrometer be such that the pixel size of the CCD, and not the spectrometer, limit the resolution.  If a camera with smaller pixels (if available later) is used, a concomitant increase in resolution, which may be required at a later date, shall be obtainable. 	c. 	The instrument shall make use of a high efficiency filter to remove the laser line from the scattered light prior to entering the spectrometer.  The filter shall attenuate the laser line by greater than 6.0 optical density.  The spectral bandwidth of the rejected notch shall be less than 350 cm-1.  The spectral edgewidth shall be less than 150 cm-1. 	d.	The spectrometer shall be a product-line instrument which has a user base and performance track-record of not less than 5 units sold, installed by the supplier, and in operation within the last year.  The spectrometer shall not be a prototype nor test model. 	e.	Because of limited laboratory space, and in order to provide the option of mobile or field operation, the spectrometer (not including the requested laser) shall be no larger than  		24" L x 24" W x 12" H and shall weigh less than 75 lbs. III	CCD DETECTOR 		Because of our sensitivity requirements, a state-of-the-art, high efficiency, back-thinned CCD is required.  It shall consist of at least 1024 by 256 pixels of no greater than 26 X 26  m pixel size.  It shall be possible to cool the CCD to at least -90 C.  The quantum efficiency at -90 C shall be greater than 85% from 500 to 700 nm.  The system readout noise shall be no greater than 10 electrons at about 30 kHz readout rate and no greater than 25 electronics at about 1MHz readout rate at -90 C.  The CCD shall have dark current of less than .001 electrons per pixel per second at -90 C  IV	FIBER OPTIC PROBE 		Because we will continuously collect spectra as a function of pH and temperature, the spectrometer shall view the sample (in a beaker or cuvette) via a fiber optic probe.  The probe shall be filtered to allow collection of spectra virtually free of Raman and fluorescence from the fiber down to Raman shift of 100 cm-1 through at least 1.5 meter of fiber.  Both Raman scatter of silica in the fiber and fluorescence from the fiber shall be filtered prior to the laser beam reaching the sample.   Because depolarization ratios will be critical in making peak assignments, the probehead shall accept polarization optics.  Also, it shall be possible for the user to align optical elements in the probehead on site.  The probehead shall accommodate interchangeable optics such that different working distances can be achieved.  At a minimum, the options on working distance shall span from 0.5 inches to 15 inches. V	COMPUTER SYSTEM AND SOFTWARE 		Because data from this Raman instrument will be used in concert with data from other instruments that run Windows-based software (i.e. ThermoGalactic GRAMS software), the software system of the Raman spectrometer shall be Windows-based, and run on a Pentium computer.  Also, the software shall either be based on GRAMS or allow convenient data import into GRAMS.  At a minimum, the software shall provide wavelength calibration, automatic intensity correction (i.e., flat fielding), and noise spike (i.e., cosmic ray) removal, in addition to basic instrument setup and operation. VI	SENSITIVITY 		Prior to purchase, the spectrometer shall be demonstrated to produce, in less than 5 minutes total data acquisition time, an unsmoothed, background-subtracted spectrum of methane sulfonamide at 50 millimolar in water (near pH of 7.0) with a S/N > 10 at the most intense peak, using no more than 150mW (at the sample) of 532 nm excitation.  This spectrum shall span Raman shift of 100 - 4400 cm-1 with resolution of  5 cm-1 and shall be collected with a fiber optic cable of at least 1.5 meters in length.  The peaks at nominal Raman shift of 326, 529, 754, 895, 991, 1152, 1315, 1417, 2938, 3021 cm-1 shall be clearly visible.  No post-run digital filtering or other manipulation to improve signal-to-noise shall be preformed.  The spectrum shall exhibit no peaks that are not attributable to the Raman spectrum of methane sulfonamide. 		The Raman supplier may use any 532 nm laser of their choosing for this demonstration.  It is not necessary that the laser mee instrument setup and alignment, frequency calibration, data acquisition, and data import into GRAMS.  Also, the contractor will provide on-site training for at least one person for at least one day and shall include, but not be limited to : theory of operation, instrument startup, software control, and routine maintenance. 	d.	The Raman supplier (and the laser supplier if different) shall provide, for at least one year, limited consultation by phone regarding instrument theory of operation, instrument setup and control, maintenance and repair, and application strategies.  The Raman supplier shall have on staff at least one full-time Ph.D. level scientist, with expertise in Raman spectroscopy as demonstrated by peer review publications, available for such consultation.  The laser supplier, if different, shall have on staff at least one full-time Ph.D. level scientist, with expertise in laser design, available for consultation. VIII	ACCEPTANCE OF CCD-BASED FIBER OPTIC COUPLED RAMAN SPECTROMETER - AND - 5WATT 532NM SOLID STATE CONTINUOUS-WAVE LASER: 		STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR ACCEPTANCE 		This clause establishes the standards of performance that shall be met before any equipment purchased hereunder is accepted by the Government, and is applicable to any equipment that is added to or modified to the proposed system, substituted, or replaced after the initial acceptance test. 	a.	With 5 days after installation, the contractor(s) shall be required to demonstrate that the instrument(s) meets all specification listed in the contractor's published descriptive literature as well as, at the request of the Government, any relevant instrument performance standards published by the contractor's employees in meeting proceedings, non-confidential reports or journal publication.  In addition, the following test criteria are established by the Government for acceptance of the equipment.  Acceptance testing by the contractor shall be part of the overall 15-day acceptance test period and shall be performed and completed by the contractor within 5 working days after installation. 		1) Laser 			With the laser emitting 250mW of power, the laser supplier shall demonstrate injection of the beam into the Raman supplier's fiber-optic based probehead using a 50 m mulitmode fiber.  This will be achieved using an EPA-supplied  injector (Oz Optics HPUC laser to fiber coupler).  The power measured emitting from the probehead shall be at least 100mW (  40% conversion).  (Note:  EPA personnel are currently able to achieve this level of conversion or better for less stable lasers emitting at 524.5 nm with this injector.)  		2)	Raman Spectrometer 			i)	The Raman supplier shall analyze an EPA-prepared series of  8 samples of methane sulfonamide in water at a concentration ranging from 10 - 200 millimolar.  The system will be able to produce a spectrum of the 50 millimolar sample in less than 5 mins with a S/N > 10 at the most intense peak using no more than 150mW (at the sample) of 532nm laser excitation.  A univariate straight line calibration curve with an R value of at least 0.980 will be demonstrated for the 8 samples. The peak ratios of several peaks throughout the spectrum will be shown to vary by less than 2% throughout this series.  The 95% confidence level based on replicate measurements (at least 15 samples) will be less than 0.5% for the 200 millimolar solution. 			ii)	Within 5 working days, the contractor will demonstrate that the back-thinned CCD does not produce spectral fringes or noise spikes that cannot be corrected by the software system.  At least 5 pure solvents will be analyzed and spectra will be shown to match, with no detectable differences, text-book reference spectra in regard to frequency and relative peak intensities, with no spurious or missing peaks, and with a virtually flat baseline.  Also, the water-subtracted methane sulfonamide spectrum at 200 millimolar will be shown to match spectra previously acquired at ERD.  	b)	Acceptance Test Period 		1)	After the contractor(s) has successfully completed the above test and demonstrated satisfactorily the capabilities of the system, the Government will continue the acceptance test period.  Samples of single chemicals in water at the 10 - 200 millimolar concentration level will be used to test the performance, precision, stability, and reliability of the equipment until a 15 consecutive day period in which the system performs effectively is completed.
