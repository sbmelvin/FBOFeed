<CONTACT>Christopher D. Pigott  7037871238     Christopher.Pigott@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Department of Interior (DOI), GovWorks, intends to solicit the following requirements as a full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.102-(b).  This competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Civil Rights.  HHS/OCR needs to contract for the requirement described below. I. Background. The mission of the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is to prevent and eliminate unlawful discrimination in the provision of health care and social services generally and in HHS-funded programs particularly; to ensure the privacy of protected health information, and to enhance access to quality programs funded by the HHS.  Through public education, outreach, complaint investigation and resolution and other compliance activities, OCR helps HHS carry out its overall mission of improving the health and well-being of all people affected by its many programs.  Among other duties, OCR investigates complaints that alleged violations of various civil rights laws by HHS-funded recipients.  Among the laws enforced by OCR is Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by the recipients of federal financial assistance.  OCR enforces Section 504 with respect to HHS fund recipients.  OCR also enforces Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by states and local government entities, with respect to health and human services programs.  II. Objective.  This contract will help HHS, through OCR, implement the President's "New Freedom Initiative" and, more specifically, Executive Order 13217 (June 18, 2001), which directs the Secretary of HHS to provide technical guidance to help states achieve the goals of the ADA.  This contract will aid HHS in resolving key aspects of ongoing complaint investigations that alleged violations of Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations and the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581(1999).  These complaints allege that qualified individuals with disabilities have been denied services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  III. Scope.  OCR requires expert consultant services to evaluate actions undertaken by a state to assess and place on wait lists for community placement, individuals, currently institutionalized in state owned and operated psychiatric facilities, intermediate care facilities for individuals with mental retardation, and nursing facilities but who could receive community-based services as an appropriate alternative to institutional care.  The contractor will develop standards and criteria for evaluating the state's actions.  The contractor will report to OCR of the effectiveness of the state's wait list management and prioritization policies.  The contractor will also make recommendations to OCR as to the need for new or revised state policies, procedures and related documents, once institutionalized individuals are identified for community placement; review these documents, and make recommendations about them.   It should be noted that in order for an offeror's proposal to be considered overall as acceptable by the Government, the proposal must, at a minimum, be considered as acceptable under the following evaluation factor which is comprised of 6 subfactors: Successful Similar Past or Current Experience as an Expert Witness: (1)        Experience in which offeror was retained as an expert witness or consultant by the United States government in any investigation or litigation involving the treatment of or services for individuals institutionalized because of disability, and/or the provision of home- and community-based services to individuals with disabilities.   (2)        Experience in which offeror was retained as an expert witness or consultant by any other party (e.g., private plaintiffs or a state defendant) in any investigation or litigation involving the treatment of or services for individuals institutionalized because of disability, and/or the provision of home- and community-based services to individuals with disabilities.  (3)        Experience in which offeror served as a court monitor or in any other court-appointed capacity in litigation involving the treatment of or services for individuals institutionalized because of disability, and/or the provision of home- and community-based services to individuals with disabilities.   (4)        Experience in which offeror was retained by a state or local government entity (including hospitals, nursing facility or intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded) to provide technical assistance regarding the treatment of or services for individuals institutionalized because of disability, and/or the provision of home- and community-based services to individuals with disabilities.  (5)        Information about every state, state instrumentality or institution (such as a hospital, nursing facility, or ICF-MR) that is now currently contracting with you (or your company, an affiliate, or any individual affiliated with your company), or has contracted with you the past providing a date, state, type of services. (6)        Information about any written report for any of the matters specified above. It is also important that the contractor have familiarity and experience with the major issues and professional standards applicable to the provision of home- and community-based services to individuals with disabilities, including those individuals who have been institutionalized.  Successful offerors will be expected to have familiarity, at least a layman's level, with the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) and other related legal precedents in this area. A request for proposal (i.e., solicitation) for this requirement will be issued within the next few days in Feb Biz Opps. Please ensure the GovWorks solicitation number 60537 is referenced in all correspondence.  Please note that this solicitation replaces solicitation no. 44274 which was cancelled on 21 October 2005. Point of Contact (POC) for this acquisition is Melicent Nhan at melicent.nhan@mms.gov or fax 703-787-1106.  Phone inquiries will not be entertained.

NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the services from Swales and Associates, Inc. on a sole source basis to allow continuation of the SAMS contract until the follow-on competitive procurement is completed using the Source Evaluation Board (SEB) procedures. This extension to the SAMS IDIQ contract will allow for the issuance of task order modifications and new work task orders up to twelve (12) months beyond the current ordering period of December 31, 2005.  Due to the time constraints and the need to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, Swales and Associates, as the current incumbent, is the only responsible source qualified to perform this requirement due to its current involvement with complex, specialized and critical research, engineering,and technical services which support the LaRC aeronautic and aerospace research programs, earth and space science programs, and related engineering activities.     The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 5, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>Solicitation for pending RFQ 7FLA-S6-05-2832 FAR 13.5 purchase as follows: Requirement for Temporary Structure – RFQ2832
Jail Facility – Orleans Parrish – November 4, 2005

Background: 

By statute, all newly arrested individuals are required to have an initial appearance within 24 hours and an arraignment within 15 days.  When Hurricane Katrina hit Orleans Parrish, the court froze the clock.  The court has now advised that on November 14, 2005, the Criminal Sheriff of Orleans Parrish must be prepared to house 2000 inmates at his correctional facility in New Orleans.

The storm caused the Sheriff to evacuate all 6,800 inmates from his facilities. The only facility that is currently operational is the House of Detention, which has an 800 inmate capacity.  Another facility will be operational in the next 10 days and has a capacity of 380.  Therefore, the Sheriff requires an additional temporary facility having a capacity of 800 beds, approximately 40,000 square feet.  

Requirement: 

1.	A temporary, prefabricated structure (approximately 40,000 square feet) is required to temporarily house minimum to medium security classification inmates.  Multiple structures are acceptable, provided they can be located in the same asphalt area meeting the 40,000 square foot need.  The facility shall be located on property owned by the Sheriff of New Orleans.  Due to the nature of this property, a facility without a permanent foundation is necessary.  A temporary facility consisting of a tension fabric structure is desired by the Government to meet requirements.

2.	Temporary jail facility shall contain suitable interior lighting (similar to office lighting), and suitable exterior lighting (similar to prison exterior lighting).
 
3.	Perimeter fencing shall be compatible with minimum to medium security classification of inmates.  Single fence with strands of barbed wire on top.

4.	The facility requires an electronic door locking system for each separate facility with one central control room for entire facility with exterior monitoring entire facility.

5.	Toilet/Shower facilities are required.  Laundry facility not required.

6.	City water, electrical power source, and sewer are accessible.  Water source provided within 100 feet of temporary jail facility.

7.	Furnishings for inmate lodging (bedding) provided by Sheriff.

8.	The facility must have built in utilities meeting the building codes and UL requirements applicable to the State of Louisiana, and all local jurisdictions.

The Government will provide the space for this facility, which will be located in Orleans Parrish, LA.  The contractor shall supply and install facility in its entirety upon delivery.  The contractor shall provide technical assistance as necessary after the installation process. Due to the immediacy of this requirement, delivery and full installation are requested within 15 days of award, or as soon as possible.

Proposals:  

Contractors must provide with their price quotation information demonstrating that their proposal meets the requirements cited above and provide references for at least three recent projects performed of similar scope.  

NOTICE TO OFFERORS

•	This is a requirement for the Federal Supply Service (FSS) in support of Disaster Recovery for Hurricane Katrina (DR-1603-LA).  The objective is to supply and install a prefabricated structure in New Orleans, LA.  Structure will serve as temporary jail facility for inmates.

•	A description of the work to be performed and clauses incorporated by reference follow.  Ordering procedures will be followed IAW FAR 13.5.  The basis of selecting a contractor to receive a resulting order will be a best value resulting in the most advantageous offer considering (1) technical, (2) specialized experience, (3) past performance, and (4) price.  When considered together, the non-price related factors are of greater value than price.  The government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price offeror based on its best value trade off decision, but may be limited by budgetary constraints.

FOR
DRIVER’S EDUCATION AND BEHIND THE WHEEL TRAINING
NEW HAVEN JOB CORPS CENTER
NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT



Bids must be received in the Purchasing Department, New Haven Job Corps Center, 455 Wintergreen Ave. by November 19, 2005, at which time they will be opened and reviewed.

A pre-bid meeting and site walkthrough will be held on November 14, 2005 in the Center’s Administrative Conference Room at 2:30 p.m. located at:

NEW HAVEN JOB CORPS CENTER

455 WINTERGREEN AVE

NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT

CONTACT PERSON:  WILLIAM  JOHNSON, PURCHASING AGENT 

Necessary bidding documents and specifications may be obtained in the Purchasing Department, on or after November 7, 2005.

It is anticipated that this Request for Proposal (RFP) shall become the final contractual document provided to the successful bidder with minor revisions incorporating appropriate aspects of the bidder’s proposal.  Bidders should therefore review the format and clauses of this contract in order to prepare a response to provide Driver’s Education Services.  In addition, Job Corps Manuals and Technical Supplements may be reviewed in the office of William Johnson, Purchasing Agent.

The New Haven Job Corps Center reserves the right to reject any or all proposals or waive formalities in the bidding process.







BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE JOB CORPS PROGRAM


New Haven Job Corps Center, operated by Career Systems Development Corporation, is located in New Haven Connecticut. There are a total of 200 students, including 50 non-resident trainees, all from the local community, who come to the Center each day for training.  

Residential trainees are recruited primarily from surrounding communities and the northern and southern portion of Connecticut.

The program meets the needs of each individual in four (4) specific areas that enable the trainee to become successfully employed.  Although many other needs are also being met, the program focuses on building vocational skills, developing academic skills and increasing awareness of social skills and core values.

Besides educational and vocational opportunities, trainees receive free housing, meals, medical and dental care, as well as living and clothing allowances.  There are daily recreational activities and outings scheduled weekly for all trainees who wish to participate.  Counseling services are available to assist trainees with their individual needs.

When training is completed and/or trainees are ready to leave, Career Transition services are provided.  In addition, trainees who leave and are pursuing independent living are provided assistance with their transition.




 



BIDDER’S INSTRUCTIONS


Bidder’s attention is drawn to the Request for Proposal and tentative subcontract attached.  It is anticipated that the draft subcontract shall become the final contractual document provided to the successful bidder, with minor revisions incorporating appropriate aspects of the bidder’s proposal.  Bidders should therefore review the format and clauses in order to prepare a response to provide Driver’s Education services.  In addition, Job Corps’ Policy and Requirements Handbook (PRH), Appendices, and Technical Supplements may be reviewed in the office of Mr. William Johnson, Purchasing Agent.

The successful bidder will be selected based upon a combination of professional expertise, quality of technical services and reasonableness of cost.  Bidders are placed on notice that bids in excess of available funding for Driver’s Education services may not be found within the competitive range.  The New Haven Job Corps Center reserves the right to reject any and all bids if no individual bid is found to be acceptable.

The bidding guidelines indicate minimum staffing/service requirements which must be provided.  Bidders are encouraged to offer supplemental staffing/services either on or off Center.  Bidders should specifically state what types and quantity of supplemental staffing and/or services are being offered.

The New Haven Job Corps Center reserves the right to award a subcontract as a complete contract package including services and material, or as a services only contract.

Proposals must not just repeat the requirements contained in the RFP/Draft Contract, but must provide the specifics of “who, what, how and when” clearly indicating the bidder’s level of understanding and ability to provide the level of service required.  It is not anticipated at this time that there will be a “best and final” opportunity to refine proposals.

Notwithstanding FAR 52.215-5, offerors will submit revised pricing only through the online mechanism supplied by Global eProcure.

The reverse auction offering period shall be set by the Contracting Officer as indicated in Section IV, paragraph (a).  Electronic offers shall be submitted by offerors during the reverse auction period.  The reverse auction is designed to extend the closing time of a offers lot if there are any offers placed in the final 2 minutes of the offering lot.

For purposes of FAR 52.203-2, and in accordance with subparagraph (c) thereof, submission of a proposal by the offeror shall be considered certification by the Offeror that the only knowing disclosure by the offeror of its prices to any other offeror will be during the reverse auction.

UNICOR reserves the right to reject any or all offers received for any or all lots.  REVERSE AUCTION – RULES.

All offerors must complete the Business Management questionnaire in Section L of solicitation document with three references.   References must be for same or similar items.  Offerors who have not done business with UNICOR shall complete the ACH form, which can be found on UNICOR’s webpage.  A completed ACH form must be on file prior to contract award as well as verification of registration in the CCR database. If you have not registered in the CCR you may do so by logging onto www.ccr.gov and click on start new registration.  Offerors can obtain a copy of the ACH form by logging onto www.unicor.gov, Business Commercial Opportunities, Navigate to, Scroll down to Procurement forms, click on ACH Form, print and return completed form with written proposal.  Effective January 1, 2005, all offers are required to complete Section K, Representations and certifications by logging onto http://orca.bpn.gov as part of the proposal submission process .   You are required to key in your DUNS# and MPIN to gain access to the representations and certifications.  Your MPIN is the nine digit code containing one alpha character and one number (no special character or spaces).  The MPIN is created, by you, in your company CCR record when your CCR registration has been completed.  You can add your representations and certifications and update using this site.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure data is up to date at all times.   ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.   Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced.   To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent  information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.  Offers received after the exact time and date specified will not be considered.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government.

DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/ OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per  the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

	1.  Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation; which in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The RFP will be issued on or about 11/21/05.  Proposals shall be received in this office on 12/22/05.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.  The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.
Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.  
Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

<DESC>The USCG Engineering Logistics Center has a requirement for: Ice Trials Planning for Measurement of Ice Properties of USCGC Mackinaw. It is anticipated that a non-competitive sole source purchase order will be issued for this study to Oceanic Consulting Corp. St. John’s, Newfoundland unless additional sources are located. All responsible and responsive sources are invited to express their interest and ABILITY to provide the above-described service via fax or e-mail to Mr. Orofino no later than November 14, 2005. It is the Government's belief that only Oceanic Consulting Corp. can provide this support. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above service are invited to submit complete information discussing the same in duplicate within 5 days of this announcement.  However, potential sources other than Oceanic Consulting Corp. desiring to furnish services are required to submit the following information: Data that the offered service has been satisfactorily provided to the government. This data must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate the proposal relative to the above requirements. Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. All responsive and responsible sources may submit a quote, which will be considered by this agency. 
The justifications for other than full and open competition for this purchase are as follows: 
a.	The organization selected to perform this work, Oceanic Consulting Corporation in St. John’s, Newfoundland, has highly specialized expertise and experience in the measurement of ice properties in support of icebreaker testing in ice.  Hence, Oceanic Consulting Corp. is able to provide highly specialized services in fulfillment of this task from a possibly limited number of sources with these unique capabilities. 
b.	Mr. Craig Kirby of Oceanic Consulting Corp. has been involved with the test planning that has taken place for the ice trials of the new USCGC MACKINAW, and as a result of the Ice Trials Planning Meetings conducted to date, is familiar with the current plans for the instrumentation and testing envisioned for the ice trials.  In addition, Mr. Kirby wrote the Ice Properties Measurement Plan based on the previously developed Ice Trials Test Plan and associated Test Memos.  Hence, the use of Oceanic Consulting Corp. for this task will preclude substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>Architect-engineering (A-E) services are required for a range of engineering services and other consulting services in connection with the development, assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of infrastructure projects in developing countries to be funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC).  

Questions regarding this solicitation should  be submitted   NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M. NOVEMBER 14, 2005, addressed to either Paulette Roseboro, Senior Contract Specialist or Ms. Sinnammal Souppaya, Contracting Officer, e-mail: Infrastructure@mcc.gov      subject line should state: A-E Services 

1. 	Contract Information

This contract is being procured in accordance with Brooks Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  Multiple Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards are anticipated for specific infrastructure sub-sector(s) and competency areas(s) (see Project Information below), each with a base year and four one-year options.  The government may exercise option periods unilaterally.  

The value and ceiling of each contract will be determined based on the sub-sector(s) and competency area(s).  The maximum value of task orders issued will not exceed $20 million each year.  The minimum guarantee for each contract shall be $2,500 for each year.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm fixed price or time and materials task orders.  

 Performance will be authorized through the competitive award of individual task orders each of which will have a specific period of performance.  Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates.    It is anticipated that the initial task order will be awarded competitively in February 2006.

While, in most cases, task orders will be issued pursuant to a competitive process, giving qualified firms a fair opportunity to compete, MCC reserves the right, based on the competition initially received under the basic contract awards, to award task orders on a sole source basis.
  
The work requirements may require performance of services at contractor facilities, at the offices of MCC in Washington, DC and in foreign countries.   The contractor is generally expected to make all logistical arrangements (hotels, visa services, translation and interpretation, local support and transportation).   

North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a design standard of $4,000,000 in average annual receipts.

It should also be noted that MCC is required to administer a small business program.  To this end, MCC seeks, to the maximum extent possible, to include highly qualified small and disadvantaged business firms in the basic contract awards and, as available, in subcontract opportunities under task orders issued.   Interested parties are reminded that the successful firm(s) will be expected to place subcontracts, to the maximum extent possible, with small and disadvantaged firms in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  Small and disadvantaged firms are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.  Any large businesses firm selected must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for submission of subcontracting plans.  In your response to this notice clearly identify your business size and, if applicable, your firm’s socio-economic status.

When work is identified, following award of IDIQ contracts, task order specific selection criteria will be provided to the contractors to supplement their SF330s.  The SF330s and supplements will be used to determine the most highly qualified firms.  

Successful firms are advised that they will not be eligible for award of a contract (funded out of the proceeds of a Compact) to implement a specific infrastructure project for which they provided development, assessment, evaluation or monitoring services to MCC or the eligible country hereunder.

To be eligible for award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.


2. 	Project Information

INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE DETAILED STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) ATTACHED TO THIS NOTICE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

MCC is engaging with a number of countries designated as eligible to apply for MCC assistance and, eventually, will enter into an agreement (Compact) for assistance with countries that submit quality proposals that support economic growth.  Countries identify their own highest priorities for achieving sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction and the MCC makes a determination of funding based on its evaluation of the merits of proposed projects and programs.  Proposals developed by countries may include requests for funding of infrastructure projects, for example, in one or more of the following sectors:

1.	Transport – highways, roads and bridges, ports, rail and airports 
2.	Water Resources, Water and Sanitation – management and development of hydro resources, rural and urban water supply and sanitation systems 
3.	Energy – resource development, electric generation (conventional or alternative energy), transmission and distribution, rural electrification, gas supply and distribution, oil and gas  exploration and production   
4.	Industrial and institutional facilities – industrial parks and agricultural processing zones; institutional facilities such as schools, hospitals, etc. 
5.	Telecom and Information Communication Technology (ICT) – telecommunications infrastructure
		
	Contractors with skills and experience in any of the above sectors may submit offers, and should indicate those sectors in which they possess appropriate skills and substantiate their qualifications.  Proposals should be inclusive of all sectors for which they wish to be considered.  

2.2 Geographic Areas and Eligible Countries

For purposes of this action, it may be assumed that MCC will be dealing with approximately 20 countries and that many of the countries will be considering multiple infrastructure projects.  Please see the MCC website (www.mcc.gov) for a list of eligible countries.  Additional eligible countries will be announced by the MCC Board of Directors in November 2005 and annually thereafter.

2.3 Competency Areas

Beginning with the proposal stage, MCC will need to assess, among other things, the technical feasibility, engineering soundness, environmental impacts, institutional aspects, economic viability and regulatory framework, financial and economic viability, and sustainability of proposed projects.  Once a project has been approved for funding under the Compact, there will be a continuing need to monitor project progress during the construction phase and, in some cases, to evaluate project performance and impacts during the operational phase.     

Contractors shall provide consulting, advisory, assessment, monitoring and evaluation services in the areas of program and project development, independent engineering, financial and economic analysis and environmental and social assessment in response to long-term and short-term task assignments.   Experience with design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of infrastructure projects is required, and overseas experience in developing countries is highly desirable.  Knowledge of foreign languages is highly desirable (especially French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Arabic) but not required.  Specific assignments within each task include, but are not limited to, the following competency areas:

Competency Area I: Project development

Once countries have submitted a proposal for MCC funding, MCC and the country may decide that additional program development activities are required.

Competency Area IV: Assessing project economics  

The contractor shall develop a financial and an economic assessment of the proposed project.  MCC is concerned with the reasonableness of the underlying projects economics and the long-term sustainability.  Financial and economic assessments that called for by MCC will generally include estimation (or validation) of the following:

•	Buildup of project costs and underlying assumptions
•	Quantification of benefits and calculation of economic rates of return
•	Calculation of financial rate of return
•	Sensitivity analysis on key variables and an assessment of risk and impacts
•	Analysis of recurrent costs, financial sustainability, tariffs, affordability, and other factors that determine project economics and sustainability  
•	Identification of beneficiaries and link to poverty reduction and economic growth
•	Identification of appropriate performance and outcome indicators, baseline data, and targets

Compentency Area V:  Assessing Institutional and Regulatory Environment

In order for infrastructure projects to be sustainable, it is necessary that a suitable institutional and regulatory framework is in place.  The contractor shall conduct a technical review of institutional and regulatory framework related to potential projects from the perspective of the funding entity, i.e., MCC.  This review will cover a variety of elements that will be further identified by the MCC but will generally include:

<ARCHDATE>12112005
<CONTACT>HUGH HARRISON 301-227-1123
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for noncommercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number N00167-06-Q-5013 applies and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The small business set-aside has been dissolved. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends on issuing an award on a sole source basis to M.C.M. Environmental Technologies Inc (MCM), Fort Lee, New Jersey 07024 in support of the Shipboard Medical waste Management Program. MCM'S medical waste processor, the Sterimed Junior, is needed for laboratory test and evaluation as part of the Shipboard Medical Waste Management Program. The SteriMed Jr. is a medical waste processing system that meets shipboard needs for sterilization, compaction, and rendering infectious medical waste non-recognizable. The system is a chemical disinfection unit that will not generate either heat or radiation and is easily installed aboard ships because it is small (a footprint of 6 square feet or less), fits through a watertight door with no disassembly, and requires few service interfaces. The unit is able to process up to 15 liters of waste within 15 minutes by simultaneously!   shredding and disinfecting the entire waste stream of infectious medical waste, reducing the volume by 90%. The liquid waste after processing is considered grey water and will simply go down the drain and the solid waste can be disposed of as regular garbage. The system requires little maintenance, and minimizes personnel exposure to infectious medical waste. The SteriMed Jr. Medical Waste Processing System was identified during a 2003-2004 market survey to identify existing medical waste processing technologies and equipment that would facilitate infectious medical waste treatment and storage aboard ship. Sources of information included industry magazines, the Internet, companies referenced in articles reviewed during literature searches, and a Federal Business Opportunity announcement, N0016703SS45. Only twenty-one of the systems identified were sized appropriately for shipboard use. These systems were investigated further to identify their sterilization capability, size!  , ability to reduce the volume of waste, and ability to render the was te non-recognizable. The SteriMed Jr. systems met all the needs identified for evaluation aboard ship. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27 as well as DCN 20041512. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 562211 and the applicable business size standard is $10.5 million annual receipts.  This requirement is as follows:   CLIN 0001 – ( 2 ) EA –  SteriMed Jr. Waste Processing System. Delivery is required 30 days ARO. F.O.B. Destination.  Final inspection and acceptance will be at Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, 9500 MacArthur Avenue; West Bethesda, Maryland 20817.  Quotes that are non-compliant with any material requirement of this solicitation may be rejected without further consideration for award. All responsible sources may submit a quote that will be considered by the Agency. A Firm-Fixed Price purchase order will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The following provisions and clauses apply:  52.213-4 {Incorporating 52.222-3, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.225-13, 52.233-3,  52.233-4, 252.204-7003, 52.232-1, 52.232-8, 52.232-11, 52.232-25, 52.233-1  252.243-7001, 52.253-1, 52.222-19, 52.222-20, 252.225-7001, 252.225-7002, 52.232-33, 52.204-7, 252.204-7004, 52.209-6, 52.211-5, 52.211-17, 52.243-1, 52.247-34, 52.211-14 (DO); 52.222-19; 52.252-2}.   NOTE: The following provisions with a "FILL-IN"  MUST BE COMPLETELY FILLED OUT and submitted with the offer:  52.222-22 [FILL-IN]; 52.222-25 [FILL-IN]; 252.225-7000 [FILL-IN]. CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a!  ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!   for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or rev!  ised performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are  summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment!  , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data.

Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.

RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of !  proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. ("AURA"), acting as the operator of the Gemini Observatory, intends to solicit proposals to supply or build a laser cutting machine capable of making precision slit masks for use in its multi-slit optical and infrared spectrometers. The machine must provide turnkey operation and nominally consist of a laser head, beam delivery optics, a computer-controlled x-y stage, and a motion controller. The machine should allow a technically competent user to cut small slits and circles in sheets of carbon-fiber laminate (a 3-ply lay-up of bi-directional carbon fibers and epoxy resin, 0.008" thick) or 0.003" thick Aluminum sheet by entering an electronic description of the position, shape and size of the desired cuts into the motion controller. The slits will have a minimum size of 120 microns wide by 1 mm long, with an edge straightness deviation and roughness of less than 1 micron. The system should be capable of cutting a minimum of 375 slits/hour. A Request for Proposal (RFP) for this procurement will be issued by AURA in November to those that submit a request to receive the RFP by 18 November 2005. Requests to receive the RFP should be sent by email to Andrew Flach, Gemini Contracts Manager, at aflach@gemini.edu, and should reference N251516 in the subject line.  In the body of the email please give the name of your organization and the contact information (name, email, street address, and telephone) for the person who will serve as your single point of contact for this procurement.  Please do not send a price quote at this time, but wait to receive the RFP which has additional requirements and specifications.

<DESC>The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s (GSFC) ST-9 Solar Sail mission is one of five competing technology validation concepts currently in a one year concept definition study sponsored by NASA’s New Millennium Program (NMP). One of these concepts will be chosen by NMP in October 2006 to proceed into Phase-B. The fundamental objective of the Solar Sail mission is to design, build, test, and fly a solar sail that provides predictable, measurable, and steerable propulsive thrust using solar radiation pressure. Corollary objectives include validating structural, thermal, attitude control, thrust vector prediction and control, and environmental effects models that can then be used for the development of much larger solar sails for use on NASA’s future strategic missions. In addition, the materials, tools, processes, and procedures used in the construction, deployment, and operation of the solar sail will also be validated.  The ST-9 Solar Sail Team will be submitting a concept definition Study Report (Mission Proposal) to the NMP Office in September 2006 to compete for the ST-9 technology validation flight opportunity. The overall schedule is shown below. Phase-A Start:	August 23, 2005 S/C Bus POD Release:  October 31, 2005 POD Responses Due:  November 19, 2005 Partner Selection:  December 10, 2005  Phase-A Study Report Due:  September 2006 Mission Selection by NMP:  October 2006 Launch Readiness:  September 2010 End of operations:  Launch + 90 to 180 days This partnership opportunity is being issued to select a teaming partner to: 1.  Develop an ST-9 Solar Sail spacecraft bus design for inclusion in the Phase-A Study Report/Proposal to NMP.    2.  Participate with the ST-9 Solar Sail Team in establishing and defining the spacecraft bus interfaces to other elements of the mission system.  3.  Develop plans and schedules for the spacecraft bus development.  4.  Prepare technical resource budgets for the spacecraft bus elements consistent with overall launch mass constraints (for both launch vehicle scenarios discussed later). 5.  Develop high fidelity cost estimates for design and production of the spacecraft bus and support for the bus-to-payload element integration, test, and launch operations.    6.  Optional: Provide mission operations services and associated cost estimate. For this partnership opportunity dealing with the development of the spacecraft bus design for the Phase-A Study Report submission to NMP, the offeror is expected to provide the above support at no cost to the Government. If the ST-9 Solar Sail Mission is selected to proceed into Formulation Refinement (Phase B), a contract award may be issued to the bus provider for Phase B and beyond.

<DESC>This is a synopsis with a separately issued solicitation.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure services regarding The Review of NCI Thesaurus and Development of Plan to Achieve OBO-Compliance.   

The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541512 and the business size standard is $21M.  

Introduction: The two major terminology products of the Electronic Vocabulary System (EVS) are the NCI Metathesaurus http://ncimeta.nic.nih.gov/ and the NCI Thesaurus http://nciterms.nci.nih.gov/.  The tasks in the SOW are focused on the NCI Thesaurus.

NCI Thesaurus is a description logic concept based namespace that contains cancer-centric terminology.  It is primarily intended for use by applications to traverse vocabulary trees and the semantic relationships between and among concepts.  It provides the base semantics for NCI’s metadata a infrastructure (see http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caDSR) and NCI’s data repository infrastructure (see http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caBIO).  In addition it is used by NCI to index the NCI’s Web portal site (see http://cancer.gov); by NIH to construct concept vectors used by the NIH knowledge management system; by the cancer Bioinformatics Grid (see http://caBIG.nci.nih.gov) to provide terminology for the various activities; and by numerous scientific applications, across a growing number of domains that increasingly extend beyond cancer.  NCI Thesaurus is published monthly by the NCI under an open content license (see ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/EVS).  

In recognition that the Thesaurus’ native DL is not widely supported, NICB translates the Thesaurus into several formats. There is a growing suite of open tools for working in Web Ontology Language (OWL), so NCICB converts each published release of the NCI Thesaurus from its native Ontylog DL to OWL/DL format, and provides the OWL rendering for download on an open FTP site (see ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/EVS/). However transliterations between DL formalisms are imperfect and the OWL rendering of NCI Thesaurus is not an exception. (NCI Thesaurus is also published in other formats, for example XML with a DTD.)

Scope:  Three general activities are within scope of this SOW. The first activity includes reviewing and reporting on the content and semantic structure of the NCI Thesaurus, a biomedical terminology produced by the NCI, for compliance with International Standards Organization (ISO) standards; and for compliance with standards related to qualification as an open terminology under OBO; and for compliance with design and semantics criteria for federation with other OBO terminologies. The second activity includes developing compliance and quality metrics.  And the third activity includes developing curatorial guidelines addressing of modeling practices and techniques. 

Anticipated Period of Performance:  Thirty six weeks after initial award, only one award will be made. 

Solicitation:  The RFQ must be requested by electronic mail or by fax.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  Request for the RFQ shall be made to the attention of Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  Requests shall include name of the contractor, DUNS number, telephone and fax number, point of contact, business size standard, and identify the RFQ requested as RFQ-NCI-60001-NG on all correspondence.  The deadline of this synopsis is November 21, 2005 at 1 PM EST.  The estimated issue date of the solicitation is November 23, 2005 and the estimated due date is December 16, 2005.

<DESC>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plans to enter into a sole source procurement for the purchase of Siemens Certified refurbished telephones and ancillary equipment with SIEMENS COMMUNICATIONS, INC, 1881 Campus Commons Drive, Reston, VA  20191-1519 under the authority of 13.501(a).  The North American industry Classification System Code is 334210 and the business size standard is 1,000 employees.  The acquisition will be made pursuant to Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.

The Line Items required are necessary components of the telecommunications infrastructure and Siemens HICOM Private Branch Exchange (PBX) system located on the NIST Gaithersburg, MD Campus.    The PBX system encompasses all operation consoles, the multiple digital analog switching system, and all peripheral phones.   The system is proprietary to Siemens, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The OEM maintains all records of the NIST PBX system and licenses and possesses knowledge that is critical to ensure seamless operation and minimal down time.  The current Maintenance Support Services Contract for the HICOM PBX system includes the repair and installation of telephones and ancillary equipment and is provided solely by the OEM.  Under the terms of the Maintenance Support Services Contract, the OEM will install and warranty Siemens Certified equipment, and if defective equipment is identified, will order and install a replacement the next business day at no additional cost to the Government.  

To ensure that there is no compromise performance, operation, or maintenance of the HICOM PBX system, it is critical that all telephones and ancillary equipment be Siemens tested and Siemens Certified.  System cards must be the latest versions of firmware for chipsets on the cards.  Opti-Point telephones must be refurbished with a Siemens Repair Kit and new components.   

Siemens Communications is the only source known to NIST that can provide Siemens Certified refurbished telephones and ancillary equipment and assume responsibility for replacement and the cost of any necessary repairs under the contracted rates of the maintenance contract.  The purchase order will consist of a one-year base period and four one year option periods.  The minimum guarantee is 200 units of any mixture of line items during the life of purchase order.  

This is not a request for competitive quotation.     However, if any interested party believes it can meet the requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.     The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NIST to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:30 EST, November 18, 2005.    A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Notional Acquisition Milestones and Events:  PM Radars will host a one-day Program Planning Briefing to Industry on 29 Nov 05 at Gibbs Hall, Fort Monmouth, NJ.  Information regarding registration for this event will be posted under a separate FEDBIZOPS ann ouncement within one week from the date of this notice.  PM Radars will host this all day event affording industry an opportunity to hear about the latest program performance goals and objectives directly from PEO IEW&S staff, the user community and PM NV/ RSTA. The informational briefings are to be followed by an open forum for industry to discuss areas of interest and to submit questions. After completion of the open forum the government plans to hold one-on-one sessions with interested parties who have pr e-registered for this portion of the event.  Additional information regarding registering for one-on-one meetings will be released in a separate FEDBIZOPS synopsis within one week from publication of this notice.  PM Radars is working towards release of a Draft EQ-36 Solicitation early 2QFY06 with a goal of receiving industry comments for consideration within 14 days from release of the draft.  The goal is to release the final solicitation within 2QFY06 with proposals for the SDD phase being submitted withi n 30 days from release. It is anticipated that proposal evaluations will take place over a three month period with the goal of awarding a single contract to the proposal determined to offer the best value to the government late in FY06. Best value consider ations will include overall performance, realism of schedule, affordability constraints, d elivery of design data, past performance and price.  The government envisions awarding an incentive type contract with meaningful rewards linked directly to schedule. The SDD phase could span a period of 24-36 months at which time the government will subje ct at least 4 prototypes to field and laboratory tests before making decisions to proceed with further development initiatives and/or proceeding onto limited or full rate production. SDD affordability considerations are linked to a projected RDTE funding p rofile totaling $189 Million in the FY06-FY10 time frame during which it is expected that some form of an Operational Test will be conducted in FY08.  Production affordability considerations are linked to Production planning budget of $1.6 Billion.

Clarification:  The RFP has been posted at PIXS with a status of  "pre-solicitation" and a "draft" watermark on the documents.  The  "pre-solicitation" status is an attempt to fix a communication problem  between PIXS and FBO, and the documents are marked as drafts only because  legal review has not been completed.  We do NOT anticipate any changes to  any of the documents.  Once the review process is complete, we will  convert the status of the posting to "released RFP" and remove the "draft"  watermark from the postings.  However, we went ahead and posted the RFP in  draft status to give offerors as much time as possible before the 15 Nov  05 response date to prepare their proposals.

<DESC>The Simulator Systems Group (SMSG) in Aeronautical Systems Center at Wright- Patterson AFB, OH will be competing the follow-on F-16 Mission Training  Center (MTC) contract with service to start in 2008.  We are formulating our acquisition strategy and this announcement is intended to notify industry  of information regarding the F-16 MTC requirement.  We anticipate releasing  the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for industry comment in August 2005 and  a final RFP in October 2005.  We expect contract award the following spring.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact the POC for this announcement at ASC.YW.F16SSPOC@wpafb.af.mil.  Interested offerors are  invited to register on the PIXS site for the acquisition.  To assist the SMSG in development of the acquisition strategy, we request the interested  offerors submit responses to specific questions posted on the F-16 MTC Follow-on  PIXS site.  In addition, all interested offerors are invited to meet with us  for one hour on 6 July 2005 to discuss their qualifications and program  requirements. This site can be reached by typing the following into your URL bar: http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil ************************************************************************ Question to Industry: Do you see any impact to awarding a non-commercial  (i.e., FAR Part 15) services contract instead of a commercial (FAR Part 12)  service contract for the F-16 MTC contract?  Would the use of a FAR 15 contract be  a substantial cost driver either for the initial award or possible contract changes after contract award?  Please provide all input by 3 October 2005. ************************************************************************ We are now projecting the release of the DRFP toward the end of November  with an industry day about two weeks after DRFP release.  If you have any  questions, please let us know.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INDUSTRY COMMENTS ON CAARS DRAFT SPECIFICATION AND DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK.  It is estimated that in Dec 05, DHS intends to issue an RFP for the development of a Cargo Advanced Automated Radiography System (CAARS) focused on the automated detection of shielded special-nuclear-material (SNM) as well as unshielded SNM; automatic detection of other contraband such as high explosives and drugs is desired.  The operational requirement for CAARS mandates that it be able to scan and process the data for a 40 foot container in under 15 seconds.  CAARS may include but is not limited to high and dual energy x-rays, gamma rays, neutrons and other transmission methods; and all image reconstruction approaches will be considered.  System characteristics must include automated image processing and alarm generation, and advanced human factors facilitating the human interface.  DHS intends to begin production and deployment of these systems in FY08.  As such, proposed technology solutions must have a 2-3 year development, test and evaluation horizon.
2.  In preparation for the development of the CAARS Performance Specification and RFP, DHS conducted a CAARS Industry day in Jul 05.  
3.  Interested prospective offerors are asked to review today's posted DRAFT specification and DRAFT Statement of Work and provide comments/questions accordingly.
4.  POINTS OF CONTACT.  Refer questions to Mr. Todd Pardue, the Program Manager (todd.pardue@dhs.gov), his Assistant Mr. Mark Rampey at mark.rampey@associates.dhs.gov, and Larna Palmer (Contracting Officer)at larna.palmer@dhs.gov

<DESC>Revise the initial synopsis to read as follows.  The U.S. Military Academy, West Point, NY is seeking sources to perform identified tasks for a Mobile Alternating Current System (MACS).  Contractor requirements: The contractor will identify and insta ll appropriate sensors to measure flow rates of water and hydrogen; hydrogen pressures; water, hydrogen and internal combustion engine exhaust temperatures; power provided by the wind turbine, photovoltaic cells, battery, and internal combustion engine; an d power provided to an electrolyzer and to an external load.  Contractor will integrate sensors into a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.  Required sensors include one low-flow hydrogen flow meter, one water flow meter, six power tran sducers, four temperature sensors, and one pressure sensor.  Background: The purpose of this project is to test a working 10kW energy source that is built on hybrid technologies of solar power, wind power and hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine.  Hy drogen is obtained from the electrolysis of water.  The goal is to reduce the operations (maintenance) of Army internal combustion engines and emissions while simultaneously reducing fuel burden for both remote power at installations and for the deployed f orce.  Cadets will model the system and compare test results with model results.  Based on performance data, cadets will recommend an improved design for future versions of the MACS.  The water/solar/wind-fueled, 10kW MACS will be tested at USMA, and then shipped to Ft. Irwin, CA, during the summer of 2006.

<DESC>Worldwide Warehouse Redistribution Services (WWRS) Program Introduction:  WWRS is a web-based redistribution service designed to  facilitate re- utilization of excess serviceable spare parts and support  equipment, previously purchased under the Arms Export Control Act, as a  source for filling Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requisitions. Goals:  WWRS is designed to:  1) reduce FMS customers’ excess inventories,  2) provide access to materiel at reduced cost, 3) reduce lead time through  redistribution of assets instead of new procurement, and 4) enable sellers  to purchase needed FMS assets with the proceeds. Program Overview:  WWRS advertises FMS excess and aligns incoming FMS  requisitions with excess materiel to provide FMS requisition support. All  materiel passes through an in-transit inspection point (IIP) contractor.  At the IIP, WWRS excess materiel is inspected (to include verification  that materiel is same NSN as represented), sanitized, and repacked prior  to transfer to the purchaser.  The IIP will take title to the materiel  prior to transfer on behalf of the USG, thereby maintaining anonymity of  the FMS parties. Materiel which fails visual inspection will be returned  to the selling country at the seller’s expense. The IIP will process,  store, and make electronically available, digital photos of all materiel.  The materiel will be photographed individually and in aggregate, on a  digital scale.   All materiel shipments that pass inspection are subject  to normal FMS Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) criteria.  The photographs  will be used in adjudicating SDRs.  The IIP may, on an exception basis, be  responsible for performing on-site inspections at seller locations  worldwide, including high threat areas/regions. The IIP may also be responsible for processing US customs clearance for  incoming shipments and receiving shipments with shipping costs due.  The  IIP may also need to establish and maintain satellite offices overseas  with the capability to receive and transship materiel from within one  overseas location to a buyer in another country. The IIP may be responsible for developing or interfacing software in  conjunction with the WWRS Program office. The IIP will be responsible for invoicing the WWRS office on a monthly  basis. Materiel remains in the possession of the seller until the WWRS Program  Manager (PM) requests the materiel.  The WWRS is a virtual materiel  warehouse with WWRS materiel being listed on a WWRS web page by NSN, MMAC,  noun, annual demand, quantity and price.  Interested FMS purchasers may  browse the WWRS web page to determine availability. Materiel may be  ordered by submitting a requisition with the Routing Identifier Code (RIC)  of ‘FWW’ (indicating WWRS as the desired source of supply) to the Security  Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS) against the appropriate  blanket order FMS requisition case for to the materiel being ordered.  WWRS requisitions are treated as fill or kill requisitions.  The seller  with the lowest priced NSN listed will be selected to fill the  requisition.  When there is insufficient quantity of the lowest priced NSN  to fill the requisition, the next higher priced materiel will be selected.  This selection process will be repeated until the requisition is filled or  all WWRS inventory is depleted.  The remaining unfilled portion of the  requisition will be canceled. Please address each the questions/statements listed below 1. The contractor is only paid for his services after the material is  shipped.  Total processing time may be up to 60 days. The contractor will  be expected to pay shipping to the first destination, and may need to pay  for incoming shipments and then will be reimbursed as part of the  invoicing process.  The largest 60 day accumulated prepaid freight and  services fee to date has been $126,100. Due to system constraints regarding payment the contractor may not be paid  for up to sixty (60) days (ex. Contractor ships item first of month,  Security Assistance Maintenance Information System (SAMIS) runs the batch  of items shipped every 30 days (end of month), then the contractors  invoice submitted at end of month is compared to the SAMIS run and if  there are errors it could take up to seven (7) days to resolve before the  program office signs the invoice and forwards to the Defense Finance and  Accounting Services (DFAS) for payment within 21 days. Discuss how you  will manage your business while waiting sometimes up to 60 days for  payment. 2. Please provide your current facility information and capability to  process several hundred shipments per month. 3. Program activity is likely to occur with large fluctuation in shipment  frequency and number.  Describe your ability to maintain a stable  workforce and turn shipments quickly despite lulls and high activity  periods. 4. Please describe the following forms: DD Forms 1348-1, 1387 and 250 and  provide samples of any of these forms previously filled out by your  company. 5. Has your company had any experience with Military Packaging (A/B) and  experience with the MAPAD? Please provide contract numbers where you were  required to perform Military Packaging. 6. Do you have a Government Quality Assurance Representative (QAR)? Please  provide the name and phone number of this individual. 7. Has your company ever used the software “Haystack or CD Fiche” or any  equivalents (please identify if you have used equivalents)? 8. Does your company currently have a Secret Clearance or ever held a  Secret Clearance? 9. Do you currently have insurance to cover any damages to goods while in  your facility? 10.  Do you have the capability of handling and disposing of hazardous  material if necessary? Please discuss. 11. It is anticipated that under the task order Contract Line Item Number  (CLIN) of the contract that the Government may need to purchase  Information Technology (IT) support for this program, for example,  programming, database design, electronic document management systems  support and software customization in accordance with USAF/AFMC/AFSAC  policies, standards and architectures. Does your company have a person  qualified to provide a broad range of information technology support? 12. Does your company have the ability to link to the SAMIS and AFSAC  On-Line systems or upload and download data files to the Web? 13. Does your company have technical experience providing inventory  management control which includes capability to process US customs  paperwork, accept and store materiel received from sellers, capability to  inspect, repackage, remove markings, electronically formatted report  process and the ability to ship in an expedited manner? SOURCES SOUGHT:  All interested and qualified sources are requested to  provide a statement of current capability and past performance information  no later than 9 December 2005.

<CONTACT>Corinne Nygren, Contract Specialist, Phone 6123363235, Fax 6123702106, Email Corinne.M.Nygren@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Pink Bollworm Rearing Facility (PBWRF), has a requirement for powdered agar which is used as a binding agent in the artificial insect diet prepared for rearing larvae of the pink bollworm. Contrary to most artificial insect diets containing agar, the pink bollworm diet is not left intact as poured, but is shredded into noodles approximately 5 mm wide and of varying thickness and length. Because of this special method of use, the agar acts more as a binding agent than it does a gelling agent as in other insect diets. As such, the requirements are more critical in terms of physical properties especially the strength of the gel and the ability to retain moisture for a relatively long period of time.  The critical specifications the agar must meet are viscosity (2.4% concentration), moisture retention (2.4% concentration), and gel strength (1.34% concentration).  

The purpose of this sources sought is to verify there are companies available that can provide the required agar and to obtain information regarding current market prices for agar. The USDA, APHIS, PPQ, PBWRF anticipates purchasing 45,000 pounds of agar and the product for this acquisition must be delivered to the facility by February 1, 2006.  
 
The agar for this requirement must meet the following technical specifications:  1.) The diet product of the water-soluble extract of Pterocladium, Gelidium or of Gracilaria confervoides. All material supplied under this contract shall be of the same type of seaweed and from the same geographical source.  2.) Not contain more than 6.5% total ash, on a dry weight basis.  3.) Not contain more than 0.5% acid--insoluble ash, on a dry weight basis.  4.) Not lose more than 20% weight when dried at 105 degrees C. for five hours.  5.) The particle size shall be: More than 75% (by weight) shall pass through a #60 U.S. Standard sieve.  6.) Must not cause a 6% reduction for a period of seven continuous days in the yield of insects, size of insects, or reproductive potential (oviposition rate), nor affect the life cycle by an increase of 24 hours or more as determined by USDA bioassay after award of contract, i.e. no bioassay of the sample is done because of the length of time required.  7.) A 2.4% agar-base liquid diet shall have low enough viscosity between 58 degrees C. and 85 degrees C. that it can be readily transferred from one vessel to another within that temperature range.   8.) Agar must have a gel strength of 1200 g pressure or more as determined with FMC agar gel testing machine.  9.) The gel point shall be within 32 degrees to 45 degrees C. and the melting point shall be within 85 degrees to 89 degrees C.  10.) Must readily dissolve in boiling water within 5 minutes.  11.)   Microbial content shall not exceed 10,000 micro-organisms per gram and must be free of other contaminants. The raw product is placed on sterile, nutrient agar plates to measure microbial content and is examined for macro contaminants when particle size is measured. 12.) Be packed in a double bag system consisting of a woven polypropylene outer bag and a separate heavy'polyethylene inner bag or fiberboard/cardboard drums. Each container shall be sound,clean, well sealed, and marked with product name, lot number, net weight;- contract number and name of Contractor.

Contractors interested in this future procurement may submit a one (1) pound sample, shipped separate from the actual sources sought information (pricing and availability information), to the PBWRF in, Phoenix, Arizona. Contractors who submit a sample in response to this sources sought will not need to submit a sample with the solicitation unless this agar sample differs in any way from the item to be supplied to the PBWRF in the event of contract award. Contractor shall furnish for each sample supplied, the species of algae (binomial scientific name), geographical source, and time of year the seaweed was collected.  
The one (1) pound sample should be sent to the following location by the date and time specified for receipt of responses to this sources sought:       
        USDA, APHIS, Plant Protection and Quarantine
        Pink Bollworm Rearing Facility
        Attn: Ernie Miller
        3645 E. Chipman
        Phoenix, Arizona      85040

Please submit information which describes your company’s technical capabilities, your company’s ability to provide the requested amount of agar by the deadline listed above, as well an indication of the market price range for this agar with an FOB destination of Phoenix, Arizona.  

In accordance with the socioeconomic goals of the USDA, we are specifically interested in doing a 100% small business set-aside, however, this does not preclude any company from submitting a response as we will take all information into consideration when determining how to proceed with this acquisition. 

The Government acknowledges that responses to this sources sought are not binding offers and recognize that market pricing may change. In order to obtain a formal offer the Government will release a formal solicitation.  The purpose of this sources sought is solely to obtain information and sources for our future requirement. 

Responses to this Sources Sought are due by Wednesday, November 23, 2005. You may send your response to the attention of Corinne Nygren by mail, by fax to 612-370-2106, or by email to Corinne.m.nygren@aphis.usda.gov.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Radar Range Testing of US Coast Guard’s new HC-130H (aircraft) Sea Search Radar System. 

This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available radar range test facilities that may be of interest to the USCG.  The United States Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center is conducting market research to determine possible facilities that can evaluate and support a comprehensive test plan and provide in-flight testing, using a calibrated test range for the Coast Guard’s new airborne sea search radar system.  

The United States Coast Guard has recently entered into a contract to replace its aging fleet of sea search radars. As part of the overall evaluation of this project, the Coast Guard is looking to independently test this radar, comparing it against all contract requirements. 

The USCG is looking for a facility that has the capabilities of evaluating and facilitating a comprehensive test plan for testing an active electronically scanned array radar system. These facilities should allow for the USCG performance of in-flight testing of this radar system, and the ability to supply the USCG with a detailed Post Test Report of the in-flight testing.  

At a minimum, the test plan will include the following areas of testing:

Airborne Target Detection and Tracking
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Range Performance Testing
Strip SAR	
Spot SAR
	Hi-resolution Spot SAR
Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) Range Performance Testing
Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) Range Resolution Testing
Range Detection Testing for various sea going vessels.

The post report shall include a “Record of events” and a “Data Analysis and Conclusions” section for each flight and area of testing. The post report will outline any deficiencies that are identified and provide conclusions of the evaluation.

Responses to this notice should include company name, address, and telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your recommended services and options. Also, state your availability and approximate lead-time for proposed testing.  

Please respond to the following questions: 
(1) Is your business a large or small business? 
(2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business?  
(3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? 
(4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm?
(5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business?  
(6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned?   
(7) Is your service listed on a GSA schedule? 
(8) Do you have other government agencies using your services, and if so which agencies, POC’s and contract numbers?
(9) If possible, any POC’s for civilian. users for general usage of product questions.  After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published on FEDBIZOPPS.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement.  All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis.  Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

Responses to this sources sought notice shall be mailed to LCDR Ed Sheppard at Bldg 78, U.S. Coast Guard, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001 or e-mailed to Edward.B.SheppardJr@uscg.mil.  Telephone responses will not be accepted.  Responses must be received no later than 30 November 2005 at 13:00 p.m. PST.  Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the Government make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only.  All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.  All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately not from the responses to this announcement.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>USAID/GH/HIDN is seeking interested firms/organizations to provide information to enable it to assess the level of interest and capabilities of firms/organizations to implement the indoor residual spraying (IRS) component of the Presidential Malaria Initiative (PMI) and provide support for IRS in USAID malaria programs in other countries, if needed. The requested information will also assist USAID/GH/HIDN to plan the proposed procurement. This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI), not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the USAID/GH/HIDN to issue any solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. It is highly recommended that firms/organizations that intend to submit proposals when USAID subsequently issues an RFP respond to this RFI to enable USAID to determine the level of interest and available capabilities for the subsequent procurement. However, it should be noted that responding to this RFI will not give any advantage to any firm/organization in the subsequent procurement. USAID is interested in receiving responses from a wide range of firms/organizations world wide, including Africa, Europe, and other places outside the United States. 

General: On June 30, 2005 President Bush pledged to increase funding for malaria prevention and treatment by more than $1.2 billion over five years with resources increasing each year.  USAID is the lead US Government Agency implementing the PMI. The goal of the PMI is to reduce malaria deaths by 50% in target countries after three years of full implementation by achieving 85% coverage of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), insecticide treated nets (ITNs), intermittent preventive treatment for all pregnant women (IPT), and indoor residual spraying (IRS). This effort eventually will cover up to 175 million people in about 15 of the African countries most affected by malaria.  In addition, USAID supports malaria programs in over 30 countries, primarily in Africa, but also in Latin America, Asia and Eurasia.  Background: USAID uses a comprehensive strategy combining proven approaches to prevent and treat malaria that are effective in reducing sickness and death from this disease as follows: (1) prompt treatment of active malaria cases with effective treatment, primarily artemisinin-based combination therapies; (2) increased access to insecticide-treated bednets for children and pregnant women; (3) intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) for all pregnant women living in high malaria transmission areas; and (4) indoor residual spraying (IRS), the organized, timely spraying of an insecticide on the inside walls of houses to reduce malaria transmission. Indoor Residual Spraying: IRS, the organized, timely spraying of an insecticide on the inside walls of houses, is designed to significantly reduce and ideally interrupt malaria transmission by killing adult female mosquitoes when they enter houses and rest on the walls after feeding but before they can transmit the infection to another person.  USAID supports the use of spraying in settings where appropriate infrastructure is available to ensure that spraying is done safely and effectively.  In the last year, USAID supported spraying programs in eight countries. Epidemiological evidence collected since 1950 suggests that IRS can be effective in all types of endemic areas, if properly implemented.  Using mainly dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), malaria was eliminated as a public health problem in large parts of the temperate zones of the world.  Today, however, few IRS programs operate in the many highly endemic countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Selection and use of insecticides: Selection of insecticides is normally based on national policies, WHO guidelines and the best locally available technical information, such as mosquito susceptibility data.  While USAID does procure insecticides for some of its health programs, activities to support purchase or use of insecticides require an environmental risk assessment.  This is a mandatory legal requirement, based on the fact that insecticides are toxins and if inappropriately selected or used they can create serious health problems, such as poisoning, and can damage the environment on which the local people rely for essential food supplies and often for their livelihood.  The required environmental assessment procedures are described in Title 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 216 (22 CFR 216), the text of which is available to the public at: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/compliance/regulations.html  In general terms, an assessment consists of an evaluation of which pesticides may be procured or used (including ones procured by USAID partners) based on scientific selection of the safest, most efficacious pesticide(s), using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency registration data.  The assessment also includes a plan for safer use, in order to reduce to a minimum any risks to humans or the environment.  This incorporates a fully funded mechanism for ongoing monitoring and compliance throughout the life of the activity.  
Insecticide resistance remains a constant threat to the effectiveness of IRS, as demonstrated recently in South Africa with the emergence of pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles funestus. Currently, a large choice of products exists to address this problem, although the cost may increase with the use of newer compounds that progressively are replacing DDT. DDT is one of several insecticides that can be deployed using IRS; this is DDT’s only remaining use under the terms of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Treaty.   USAID can procure and/or use DDT for malaria IRS when safe, effective and affordable alternatives do not exist and where an activity is designed and funded to ensure its proper use.  However, as with any other insecticide, procurement or use of DDT in a USAID supported activity requires completion of the appropriate 22 CFR 216 environmental assessment. Goods and Services Required: (a) Day-to-day operational management support to on-going USAID-supported IRS primarily in the focus countries of the PMI, but also in other countries as requested; (b) Preparation and execution of an IRS logistical plan, including the purchase and handling of sprayers, insecticides and any other supplies that are required to carry out the proposed IRS operations; (c) Compliance with all related USG environmental regulations, including the provision of an Environmental Impact Assessment in compliance with 22 CFR 216; (d) Expert short and long-term technical assistance for IRS activities; (e) Skills training and ongoing supervision/monitoring for safe and effective spraying in accordance with WHO guidelines. Requested Information: USAID/GH/HIDN requires brief “Yes” or “No” answers to and/or information on issues raised by the following questions. (Please note we are not seeking a full description of your capabilities at this time.): Has your firm and/or organization the (1) Capacity to provide technical advice and support in the planning and implementation of sustainable IRS activities for routine malaria control operations?; (2) Capacity to design, implement and evaluate training and supervision in key IRS skill areas, such that for each country where this program works, the  Malaria Control Program could have a functioning IRS component by the end of the PMI?; (3) Capacity to design, implement and monitor an IRS procurement logistics plan, including adequate safeguards to prevent “leakage” of insecticides to non-vector control uses, stock rotation, and secure storage?; (4) Capacity to build the capacity of each country’s MCP such that its national staff are able to conduct entomological monitoring of relevant factors, including detecting behavioral as well as physiological insecticide resistance among the mosquitoes in its target spraying areas?; (5) Capacity to prepare an environmental impact assessment in accordance with 22 CFR 216?; and (6) Capacity to conduct performance monitoring and reporting of the program’s adherence to WHO’s IRS technical standards, the quality of training and ongoing supervision, the efficiency and reliability of procurement activities, and compliance with environmental procedures as listed in 22 CFR 216? Also, for each and every possessed capacity, please indicate the country in which your firm has that capacity. The information provided in response to this RFI should not exceed one (1) page. Your brief, precise responses should be addressed to: bduodu@usaid.gov. All responses should be received electronically by November 23, 2005. END OF RFI. Suzanne H.

<CONTACT>Andrea Haney, (309) 782-5164
<DESC>Sources Sought on  LOGCAP IV Planning/ Support This is a Sources Sought notice requesting information needed by the Government prior to release of a potential solicitation.  This is not a request for proposal. The   Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) oversees LOGCAP planning, exercise and training support, and management of event execution worldwide.  Currently there is a single contractor performing this effort on the LOGCAP III contract.  One of the  acquisition strategies being considered to increase LOGCAP support capacity is to award multiple contracts for the execution of LOGCAP operations (LOGCAP IV), and award a separate contract for a broad range of technical support.  That technical support in cludes, but will not be limited to, deliberate planning, preparation of the Worldwide Management and Staffing Plan (WMSP), contingency event support, training and exercise participation, and technical support including cost analysis and pre-award task orde r proposal review.  The HQ US Army Field Support Command is requesting Industry input on a potential acquisition strategy that includes this separate logistics support contract approach.   The strategy requiring Industry input deals with the capability, capacity, and experience in providing a full range of logistics support.  The primary support is to document the LOGCAP WMSP, regional plans, and integrate that planning with LOGCAP IV contra ctors and theater planners.  It involves: updating the LOGCAP WMSP and regional plans; assisting commands with documenting LOGCAP annexes to theater operations plans; integrating standardized scopes of work (SOW) into theater plans; working with the LOGCAP   IV execution contractors with their internal planning for possible operations, exercise participation to validate LOGCAP IV performing contractor plans; and deploying into contingency situations as needed to support theater planners with determination of  LOGCAP requirements.   The support contractor will be required to document the WMSP which uses a scenario to describe how LOGCAP performing contractors support for U.S. troops on a worldwide basis.  The WMSP serves as the planning source document in the development of more speci fic plans for operational support.  The WMSP details how support tasks (staffing details, equipment lists and prices, supplies and consumables) will be accomplished.  The WMSP is a deliverable and will be updated annually.  The support contractor will be r equired to partner with performing contractors and adapt their corporate unique business practices into the WMSP.  The planning contractor must understand the unique corporate business practices of the LOGCAP IV contractors including how the following will  support the force:  construction/engineering  communications  information management  service support - security  public affairs  worldwide vendor database  work breakdown structure.  The contractor will also be required to support combatant commanders with resident LOGCAP planners in theater.  Those personnel will be required to become familiar with theater contingency logistics support requirements, assist with documentation of delibe rate planning products, and advise and/or recommend how LOGCAP support can most effectively be integrated into worldwide and regional planning.  The Government also requires a wide range of technical support to the LOGCAP Director.  That support will include: assisting Government staff in LOGCAP training of troops prior to deployments, assisting the Government in developing Independent Government C ost Estimates (IGCE) for task orders; assisting in the analysis of LOGCAP IV contractor approaches and costs in proposed execution plans; providing analysis of contractor approaches on SOW requirements; assisting with analysis in definitization of unpriced   task orders; developing better methodologies to track and forecast performance and cost; recommending efficiencies in LOGCAP program operations ; preparing required reports and information including presentations; and supporting the Governments management of LOGCAP actions during operational surges. The support contractor will be required to participate in the requirements definition process with the Government and performing contractors.  The support contractor will also be required to initially deploy into contingency situations to accomplish initia l planning and validation of theater requirements, and then following task award, hand off of planning responsibility to the performing contractor early entry management team.  The support contractor will also provide cost analysis of performing contractor  proposals and similar documentation at the direction of the PCO/ACO/COR.   The skills required include: a solid background in military operational planning and logistics operations support; familiarity with status of forces agreements; familiarity with international agreements affecting entry, sustainment, and closeout of operati ons in countries.  LOGCAP support contractor employees may be required to deploy on short notice to support theater logistics and planning efforts.  They must provide effective and accurate advice concerning LOGCAP program issues when supporting theater pl anners whether in actual operations or in training situations. To preclude possible conflicts of interest, the LOGCAP support contractor cannot be a LOGCAP IV prime contractor or subcontractor or one of their affiliates.  The support contractor will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements with the LOGCAP IV cont ractors for access to their proprietary information.   Since the support contractor will be working with classified operational plans, they must meet National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) requirements to access such information.  Contractors are requested to provide their capability and capacity to meet the range of logistics support actions identified above.  If you do not have all the capabilities, identify how you would acquire them.  Identify your business size for the NAICS co de 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.  The information being requested does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor to pay for any costs incurred as a result in replying to this notice.  This notice neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitat ion for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. Your information is requested by no later than COB Nov 16, 2005 and must be submitted by email to andrea.haney1@us.army.mil.  Reference LOGCAP IV Planning/Support Sources Sought in the subject of your message.

<SUBJECT>R -- Tops In Blue Sponsorship Opportunity
<DESC>On November 29, 2005 Robins Air Force Base will once again be hosting Tops In Blue in the Century of Flight Hangar at the Museum of Aviation. The Tops In Blue team will perform before an audience of more than 600 people. The show is free of charge and open to the general public. The audience will primarily consist of active duty military and their family members.
Tops In Blue is composed of 36 of the most talented active duty US Air Force vocalists, musicians, and dancers worldwide. Tops In Blue is one of the oldest and most widely traveled entertainment groups of its kind. The 2005 tour will take Tops In Blue throughout the United States and to more than 27 countries, with a total of over 140 performances over a 9-month period. The Tops In Blue team puts in a lot of hard work for each show, not only during, but before each and every show they are responsible for setting up over 40,000 pounds of staging, audio, lighting, and special effects equipment required for each performance. 
This year is going to be special for us here in Warner Robins as well as the Tops In Blue performers as the show will be in a different venue. For this exciting production we would like to partner with companies and individuals who are interested in providing cash and in-kind to offset the costs of food to feed the team at the meet and greet on November 28 and the continental breakfast, lunch and after show dinner on November 29. We want to ensure the members receive the sort of trademark welcome that Middle Georgia is famous for giving guests to our community.  
Would your company like to be a part of the Tops In Blue performance again this year?  If so, we can offer you possible logo and/or name recognition in promotional event materials, our Services Edge magazine (15,000 published per month), our Services website, the Rev-Up (20,000 published per week) and even on an event thank you sign.  (All opportunities above are dependent on the total value of your donation.) Those interested in participating should contact Marisa Mammano at (478) 926-6629 or (478) 926-5492 no later than November 22, 2005. Thank you for your time and consideration.

<SUBJECT>52 -- Interrogating a Large Number of Active Sensors and Actuators for Structural Health Monitoring / Structural Integrity Monitoring
<DESC>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to assist in advancing and commercializing LANLs Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) / Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIM) technologies.

Partnerships may take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/or commercial licenses. Commercial licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, a non-exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation. CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to the Lab.

LANLs SHM / SIM includes methods for interrogating a large number of active sensors/actuators. The technology involves a relay-based electronics hardware system that allows for the efficient sensing (interrogating/actuating) of piezoelectric (or similar) sensors for use the field of SHM / SIM. This hardware serves as an active multiplexer that not only condenses previously actuated signals, but also provides the signals for the physical actuation of the sensors themselves. The use of the methods described in prior work is both time and cost prohibitive for current SHM / SIM practice. 

Advantages include:

> Designed for local, active sensing vs. low frequency global system responses

> Because of frequency ranges, this method is more sensitive to small defects in a structure

> Scalability: Can accommodate large number of sensors/actuators without suffering from cabling or wiring issues, which usually make large scale project prohibitively expensive

> Adaptability and Flexibility: Can accommodate any type of actuator or sensor. It does not have to be piezoelectric. The method can also adopt any SHM method, including wave propagation, impedance methods, and time-series analysis

> Improves and alleviates the current limitation of wireless SHM systems

CONTACT PERSON:  WILLIAM JOHNSON, PURCHASING AGENT 

Necessary bidding documents and specifications may be obtained in the Purchasing Department, on or after November 7, 2005.

It is anticipated that this Request for Proposal (RFP) shall become the final contractual document provided to the successful bidder with minor revisions incorporating appropriate aspects of the bidder’s proposal.  Bidders should therefore review the format and clauses of this contract in order to prepare a response to provide Dentist Services.  In addition, Job Corps Manuals and Technical Supplements may be reviewed in the office of William Johnson, Purchasing Agent.

The New Haven Job Corps Center reserves the right to reject any or all proposals or waive formalities in the bidding process.


BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE JOB CORPS PROGRAM


New Haven Job Corps Center, operated by Career Systems Development Corporation, is located in New Haven Connecticut. There are a total of 200 students, including 50 non-resident trainees, all from the local community, who come to the Center each day for training.  

Residential trainees are recruited primarily from surrounding communities and the northern and southern portion of Connecticut.

The program meets the needs of each individual in four (4) specific areas that enable the trainee to become successfully employed.  Although many other needs are also being met, the program focuses on building vocational skills, developing academic skills and increasing awareness of social skills and core values.

Besides educational and vocational opportunities, trainees receive free housing, meals, medical and dental care, as well as living and clothing allowances.  There are daily recreational activities and outings scheduled weekly for all trainees who wish to participate.  Counseling services are available to assist trainees with their individual needs.

When training is completed and/or trainees are ready to leave, Career Transition services are provided.  In addition, trainees who leave and are pursuing independent living are provided assistance with their transition.



BIDDER’S INSTRUCTIONS


Bidder’s attention is drawn to the Request for Proposal and tentative subcontract attached.  It is anticipated that the draft subcontract shall become the final contractual document provided to the successful bidder, with minor revisions incorporating appropriate aspects of the bidder’s proposal.  Bidders should therefore review the format and clauses in order to prepare a response to provide Dentist services.  In addition, Job Corps’ Policy and Requirements Handbook (PRH), Appendices, and Technical Supplements may be reviewed in the office of Mr. William Johnson, Purchasing Agent.

The successful bidder will be selected based upon a combination of professional expertise, quality of technical services and reasonableness of cost.  Bidders are placed on notice that bids in excess of available funding for Dentist services may not be found within the competitive range.  The New Haven Job Corps Center reserves the right to reject any and all bids if no individual bid is found to be acceptable.

The bidding guidelines indicate minimum staffing/service requirements which must be provided.  Bidders are encouraged to offer supplemental staffing/services either on or off Center.  Bidders should specifically state what types and quantity of supplemental staffing and/or services are being offered.

The New Haven Job Corps Center reserves the right to award a subcontract as a complete contract package including services and material, or as a services only contract.

Proposals must not just repeat the requirements contained in the RFP/Draft Contract, but must provide the specifics of “who, what, how and when” clearly indicating the bidder’s level of understanding and ability to provide the level of service required.  It is not anticipated at this time that there will be a “best and final” opportunity to refine proposals.

Part 1 – General

The New Haven Job Corps Center, a federally funded training program servicing 412 resident and non-resident trainees ages 16-24 would like to invite qualified bidders to provide on-site Dentist services for the enrolled population.

Enrollees in the program are screened by the Center and Federal recruitment agencies.  A common criterion for eligibility is the need and the desire to learn a skill to become more employable.  Enrollees are generally considered healthy, but physical and emotional problems can be present which must be considered and addressed.  Some of the 200 authorized trainees may at any given time be enrolled under the auspices of special disability programs, which accommodate trainees with a variety of physical impairments without age restrictions.

The base period of this subcontract to provide Dentist services shall begin on December 5, 2005 and expire on November 30, 2006 concurrent with expiration of Career Systems Development Corporation’s current prime contract with the Department of Labor.   This subcontract may be renewed for up to two (2) additional option years in conjunction with the renewal of the Center’s prime contract by mutual agreement of both parties.  If the subcontract is renewed, increased payment will not be negotiated but rather payment will be increased by the same percentage of increased applied to the prime contract.

The CONTRACTOR and all staff must come to the Center to complete pass and identification requirements and vehicle registration prior to start of contract.  The successful CONTRACTOR will assume complete accountability for CONTRACTOR services on December 1, 2005. 

CONTRACTOR shall be required to provide minimum levels of malpractice insurance to cover all services provided to trainees.  Minimum acceptable levels are $1,000,000 per incident and $3,000,000 aggregate, but higher limits are recommended.

<DESC>It is the Navy Exchange Service Command's (NEXCOM's) intention to award a license agreement to a qualified, responsible firm to provide food services in designated areas of the Pentagon as described below.  These locations are currently operated by Eurest Dining Services and will transition to the successful offeror upon award of this license agreement.  The food requirements for each location are identified below.  To be considered for award, offeror proposals must include all 3 locations.  Proposals for a portion of the locations identified in this solicitation will not be considered.  Except for bulk food storage needs, all food production to support the three separate food service areas described below must be accomplished within designated food court areas and no other food production space will be available.  Storage requirements beyond one day's requirements for chill, freeze and dry storage will be made available apart from the three food service areas.  
 Wedge I food court.  The preferred concepts within the food court are:  sushi, name brand coffee, pizza, chicken, comfort food, bakery/sandwich and a salad concept.  The approximate sales of each of the presently operated concepts in the Wedge I food court are listed below.  It is anticipated that responsibility for operation of the food court shall be transitioned from the present food court operator to the successful offeror ("Licensee") approximately 60 days after award.  The Licensee is not expected to invest a significant amount of capital to renovate Wedge I spaces but generally assume and operate the food court based on its present configuration.  Should an offeror propose significant operational or concept changes to the current food court space, associated costs to make the changes shall be borne by the offeror.  Before making such changes, approval by cognizant Pentagon officials will be required.  Accordingly, offerors' proposed space design changes will also be required as part of the proposals.  Estimated current annual sales for the Wedge 1 food court are $2 million.  
 Corridor 10.  The Licensee shall assume operation of designated areas (two concepts) in the current Corridor 10 food court within 60 days from contract award.  The brands currently offered in these spaces are Hearth Stone Oven and Manchu Wok.  NEXCOM would prefer to maintain these menu segments (Comfort Foods and Asian) whether branded or unbranded.  As with Wedge I, the Licensee is not expected to invest any significant capital to renovate these designated areas.  The food court is scheduled to close for Pentagon renovations in the fall of 2007.   
 Concourse.  The Licensee shall assume operation of this area, currently operated as an Au Bon Pain, on the concourse level within 60 days from contract award.  The Licensee must operate the same bakery/sandwich concept in this area as they have proposed to operate in the Wedge1 Food Court.  As with Wedge I and Corridor 10, the Licensee is not expected to invest any significant capital to renovate this area.  The concourse is scheduled to close for Pentagon renovation in the fall of 2007.

The Contractor further agrees to insert provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder.

8.  Attachment II, Statement of Work is hereby amended to incorporated the information below.  Please incorporate this information between the two following sentences:

1.	… While some of this research can be accomplished using publicly available data, some issues may require collection of new data. and 

2.  Departmental policy officials often manage and address the effects of unforeseen food and agricultural market developments such as large swings in sales volume, prices, or quantities purchased of major food products without the most up-to-date market information….  

For example, there are no public sources for current information on who is consuming what, how much, where, and what price.  Similarly, there are no public sources for important factors such as consumers’ dietary and health knowledge, attitude, purchasing behavior along with their demographic and health status. While publicly available data are based on large samples, the administration and tabulation of surveys often result in outdated information. Changing nutrition knowledge, diet fads, and food safety incidents make consumer food demand more volatile.  

9.  In the Point of Contact reference, the email address for Jehad Salameh is incorrect.  The correct email address is jsalameh@ars.usda.gov and is reflected in the following:

Point of Contact
Jehad Salameh, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-720-6531, Fax 202-720-3987, Email Jsalameh@ars.usda.gov; Anthony Wimbush, Contracting officer, Phone (202) 720-3998, Fax (202) 720-3987, Email twimbush@ars.usda.gov

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

Guidance on USTDA Development Impact Measures

USTDA has a dual mission of promoting US exports and advancing economic development in the host country.  USTDA would like to re-emphasize the Agency’s developmental mandate.  Toward this goal, the Agency is collecting more detailed information regarding the impact of its activities on the economic development of the host country.

What does USTDA mean by Development Impact?
USTDA’s activities impact host country economic development in a variety of ways.  There are four primary categories that are tracked and measured.  However, the Agency recognizes that there are additional ways that activities can benefit the host country.  Therefore, study contractors are encouraged to address any significant benefits. 

Category	Explanation
Infrastructure	USTDA funds feasibility studies of and technical assistance for many critically important infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications systems, water and sewerage systems or environmental improvements or enhancements, as well as projects such as refineries and manufacturing plants.  Implementation of these projects contributes to the improvement and security of the physical, financial and social infrastructure of the developing world.  
Market-Oriented Reform	Many USTDA activities have as a primary objective the facilitation of market-oriented reforms in developing countries. These reforms include encouraging more transparent regulatory systems and institutions, privatization of state-owned economic entities, promotion of greater competition in non-competitive economic sectors, lowering of non-tariff barriers to trade, strengthening of intellectual property rights and modernizing international trade systems and regulations.  
Human Capacity Building	When implemented, the Agency’s projects often create new job opportunities, sustain employment for those in jeopardy of losing jobs and/or offer advanced training to upgrade the capability of the work force.  USTDA considers a project to have Human Capacity Building impact if ten or more jobs are created and/or ten or more people receive significant training.
Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement	The Agency’s projects result in the introduction of advanced technologies (e.g. management information systems or process technologies) or licenses that improve processes and/or systems , resulting in greater economic productivity or more efficient use of resources.
Other	Other development benefits not captured by the above four categories - examples include enhanced government revenue, increased good governance or spin-off projects.






 
How Should the TOR of the FS/TA Address Development Impact?

The TOR should include a task that assesses the expected development benefits of the proposed project.  For example:

The FS/TA Contractor shall report on the potential Development Impact of the project in the host country.  In this section, the FS/TA Contractor should focus on what the economic development outcomes will be if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.    While specific focus should be paid to the immediate impact of the specific project that is being considered, the FS/TA contractor should include, where appropriate, any additional developmental benefits to the project, including spin-off and demonstration effects.  The analysis of potential benefits of the feasibility study contractor should be as concrete and detailed as possible.  The Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the host country.  The FS/TA contractor will provide estimates of the project’s potential benefits in the following areas: 

•	Infrastructure: a statement on the infrastructure impact giving a brief synopsis.  For example “This project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve x additional households in the region.”

•	Market-Oriented Reform: a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

•	Human Capacity Building:  The Contractor should address the number and type of positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project as well as the number of people who will receive training and a brief description of the training program.

•	Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement: a description of any advanced technologies that will be implemented as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that will be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%).

•	Other: any other developmental benefits to the project, including any spin-off or demonstration effects.

 
How Will This Affect the Final Report For the FS or TA?  

•	A section in the final report will be devoted to the projected host country Development Impact of the FS or TA recommendations if they are implemented.  The section should focus primarily on the key issues mentioned above (infrastructure and industrialization, human capacity building, technology transfer and productivity, and market oriented reform).  Other host country development impacts (e.g. improved financial revenue flows to host government etc.) can be mentioned where appropriate.  The discussion should be as detailed and concrete as possible, and the contractor may provide estimates in ranges as appropriate.

<DESC>6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The main focus of the DM is to evaluate potential USTDA funding activities to support environmental projects that Petrobras is planning at its new refinery and petrochemical projects.  In addition, the DM will be used to evaluate refinery and/or petrochemical environmental projects being developed by private sector companies in Brazil.  USTDA has made initial contact with one prospective private sector project sponsor and will provide additional information to the winning bidder.

During a meeting with USTDA staff in October 2005, Petrobras environment, health and safety managers identified the need for studies to plan water re-use, emissions abatement, and energy efficiency projects related to new refinery and petrochemical plants.  

According to the Petrobras 2006-2010 Business Plan, Petrobras will make investments totaling US$56.4 billion in Brazil and abroad during this five-year period.  During 2006-2010, Petrobras plans to invest US$8 billion in its refining capacity and US$2.0 billion in petrochemical production.  In petrochemicals, Petrobras is proactively seeking synergies between refining and petrochemical projects.  Major new petrochemical projects include an integrated refinery and petrochemical plant in the State of Rio de Janeiro, a petrochemical plant in the State of Pernambuco, an acrylic complex in the State of Minas Gerais and a polypropylene unit in the State of São Paulo.  


 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.
