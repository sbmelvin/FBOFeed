<p><span style="COLOR: black">The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) F-15 Division, WPAFB, OH intends to issue a solicitation and award a sole source contract to The Boeing Company (Boeing-STL)&nbsp;for a state of the art, long range, integrated Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system.&nbsp; The scope of this effort will include </span>IRST and Operational Flight Program (OFP) integration and test, Low Rate Initial Production, Full Rate Production, management, delivery of spare parts and support equipment, training, systems engineering, technical support, updated technical orders, and will provide Interim Contractor Support (ICS), support organic depot stand-up, and develop and deliver technical data. This IRST effort includes integration of F-15 aircraft-level OFP with one hundred twenty-five (125) IRST production aircraft pods (one hundred (100) to ACC and up to twenty-five (25) additional for ANG) and eight (8) Test Assets. The OFP integration is to ensure the IRST software in the mounted pods operate as designed without compromising any of the existing capabilities of the aircraft.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">After release of the request for proposal (RFP), Boeing-STL will be required to competitively select an IRST pod supplier which will meet the Air Force's IRST requirement. The competitive source selection will secure fixed pricing from the IRST pod supplier throughout integration and test, LRIP and FRP. The IRST pod hardware represents over half of the total contract price, thus providing competitive pricing for a majority of this effort. After an IRST pod supplier has been selected, Boeing-STL will proceed with integration of the selected pod. During this effort, Boeing-STL will begin the preliminary OFP software work, substantiate technical and integration risks, validate Critical Technology Elements (CTEs) and Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), and plan the program baseline through the preliminary design review and critical design review. <span style="COLOR: black">The planned&nbsp;fielding of this IRST system is targeted to be late 2019.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The F-15 Program Office believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Force's requirements. The integration of the mission critical F-15 IRST pods is both complex and highly specialized as it must seamlessly integrate with multiple other mission systems on the aircraft, including but not limited to: APG-63(V)3 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, APG-82(V)1 AESA radar, Advanced Display Core Processor (ADCP) II mission computer upgrade, and the F-15 Aircraft OFP. Boeing-STL is currently the sole integrator managing each of these on-going F-15 modification programs. The F-15 IRST effort must specifically address complex Electromagnetic Interface</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">(EMI), and Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) interoperability. Due to Boeing-STL's position as the sole integrator of all other major F-15 subsystems, they are in the best position to ensure that IRST is interoperable with other F-15 subsystems. Duplication, or transference, of the capabilities possessed by Boeing would be cost and schedule prohibitive. Furthermore, during market research activities conducted for this program, all other vendors responded that they would not be capable of full integration of the IRST pod. All vendors indicated they would require assistance from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Boeing-STL.</span></p>

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL/RXC, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Structural Materials is announcing to industry its intent to solicit proposals under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). This research will utilize legacy carbon-fiber composite airframe components to establish the effects of in-service natural aging on the composite material properties and determine the importance of environmental aging as a critical parameter in the service life of the composite structure.  In-service aging includes the influence and interaction of time, load, heat, ultraviolet light, oxidation, and other environmental conditions on material property loss.  Furthermore, the envisioned research intends to develop progressive damage models to include the residual strength effects as observed from fleet in-service environmental history and/or account for spatially varying properties observed in a laboratory aging scenario or through simulation of the aging process.
<p>The overall objectives in this initial effort is to address whether in-service aging influences composite material mechanical properties meaningfully through a sampling of fielded components and to enhance progressive failure analysis methods to include spatially varying property distributions attributed to environmental degradation regardless of the outcome of the in-service components sampled.</p>

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
22.	UID:  If unit price exceeds $5,000.00 then UID requirements will apply.

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii) all responsible sources may submit a  capability statement proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  However, only qualified sources will be considered for award
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<DESC>This requirement is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. The solicitation will be available for review on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). Potential offerors are encouraged to submit offers via email to the address listed on the solicitation.

(iii) Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically. Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail. Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized. Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for  proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically. The solicitation number for this requirement will be: SPRTA1-17-Q-0025.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 21.  Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer Louis Colon, 405-734-8116, louis.colon.2@us.af.mil.

<DESC>Army Contracting Command - Redstone intends to procure highly specialized technical support for the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Support Center (P3MSC) Missile Field Surveillance and Missile post-production activities to support the United States and Foreign Military Sales Customers. This requirement includes Stockpile Reliability Testing, Special Reliability Studies, Missile Recertification, Missile repair parts and services, Unscheduled Maintenance, and Recapitalization of Enhanced Launcher Electronics System. The nature of this contract action is to solicit a new Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), five year contract to be awarded on or before 19 May 2017 through 19 May 2021. The PAC-3 Missile Support Center requirements are available from one responsible source, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (LMMFC), Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code 64059, 1701 W. Marshall Drive, Grand Prairie, TX. 75051. As the developer and producer of the PAC-3 Missile Segment and support equipment, LMMFC is the only source with the knowledge, expertise, and technical data package (TDP) to perform this effort. The statutory authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition is Title 10, United States Code, Section 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302(a)(2)(iii)(A), Only One Responsible Source, and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Additionally, the product support data is not readily available to prohibit significant delays and/or failures due to the enormous learning process involved&nbsp;and lack of technical expertise available. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Agency. Offerors are encouraged to contact LMMFC for subcontracting opportunities for this effort. This requirement is currently unfunded; award will be withheld pending receipt of sufficient funds. No telephone or email requests will be accepted.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY ANNOUNCEMENT for the eLearning Management System (eLMS) Support

1. Introduction/Purpose
This market survey is conducted to determine whether adequate competition exists, or whether to set-aside competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

2.Scope:
The FAA learning community has a requirement for a framework that provides enterprise-wide support for applications and services to meet training and development goals.  The Leadership Development division within the FAAs Office of Human Resources is responsible for maintaining the applications, development activities, and support services within this framework.  The Vendor will provide on-site and virtual services to support the FAA Learning Enterprise Architecture. The Vendor will provide Tier 1 and Tier 2 help desk support for SuccessFactors and for FAA Blackboard Learn.

3. Background:
One of the key drivers for change within the FAA has been the advent of a centralized eLearning Management System (eLMS).  With the complexity of the FAA training infrastructure, eLMS alone cannot achieve the tenets of the FAAs Destination 2025 as well as to supplant all training systems that have been identified across the FAA.  The goal of the FAA Learning Enterprise Architecture (LEA) is to design an infrastructure that both serves the full needs of the FAA training community while also meeting the demands of system consolidation.  In addition, the efforts of the LEA also represent the intersection between the FAA training community and the FAA Chief Information Officer (CIO) efforts.

The LEA will serve as the critical link between how the FAA manages its employee development and how the FAA achieves the tenets of the Destination 2025.  

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from sources that can provide the services as described in the attached SOW.  Responses to this market survey will be used to finalize the FAA's acquisition strategy for the requirement.  The vendor selected will provide the services, in accordance with the attached SOW, for the planned period of performance of five years from the date of award.  The award structure will include a 12 month base period with four 12 month option periods. See the attached SOW for details on the work to be performed.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate on the basis of other than full and open competition with Fisher Bioservices Inc., 14665 Rothgeb Drive, Rockville, MD 20850-5312 for off-site freezer storage, maintenance, pick-up and delivery of biological specimens to and from NIAID DIR in Bethesda and Rockville, Maryland. Period of performance will be November 1, 2016 - October 31, 2017. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR Part 13.501(a)(1).
<p><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type of contract.</p>
<p>See the attached Statement of Work and Equipment Inventory information for further details.</p>
<p>It is not feasible to transfer material at this time due to sensitivity and history of the specimens held at the current off-site facility. In order to relocate the current allotment of 18 freezers, its contents, the materials stored in 7 liquid nitrogen units, and 8 shelves of materials located in ambient storage units would not only be hazardous to the stored specimens but would be logistically problematic to transfer specimens and equipment in this quantity. A mass transfer of stored specimens, increase the risk of damaging critical research material by not maintaining the optimum temperature and would be costly to the government.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible. THIS NOTICE of INTENT ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. All responsible sources who can provide the required services may submit a response that could be considered by email (subject line to reference NIAID-NOI-17-1816672) to Tonia Alexander at talexander@niaid.nih.gov, by 5:00 pm eastern standard time Monday, October 17, 2016. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NIAID to determine if it can meet the required services. All responses received by the closing date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<CONTACT>Jennifer Iribe 619-532-1637
<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW) is establishing a Southern California and Arizona 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA). NAVFAC SW is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) Developmental Stage (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, CA; and Phoenix, AZ) to participate in this BOA program. The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs. The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c). The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts. The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between NAVFAC SW and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract. In accordance with DFARS Clause 252.219-7009 the 8(a) firm shall not subcontract the performance of any of the requirements of the contract without the prior written approval of the SBA and the Contracting Officer. Additionally FAR Clause 52.219-14 defines the limitations on subcontracting should approval to subcontract be obtained. Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed. If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government, upon SBA concurrence, reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts. Only the following designated NAICS codes pertain to this BOA: 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction; 237110 Water, Sewer Line  and  Related Structures Construction; 237120 Oil, Gas Pipeline  and  Related Structures Construction; 237130 Power, Communication Line  and  Related Structures Construction; 237310 Highway, Street  and  Bridge Construction; 238160 Roofing; 238210 Electrical Contractors  and  Other Wiring Installation; 238220 Plumbing, Heating  and  Air-Conditioning; 238320 Painting  and  Wall Covering; 238330 Flooring; 238910 Site Preparation Contractors; 238990 All Other Specialty Trade Contractors. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). Types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items). However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be under the NAICS Subsector 238. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $4,000,000 per firm. Individual task orders will range between $2,001 and $1,000,000. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $30,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each order. Task orders will not be advertised. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA. Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible. To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) Developmental Stage participant prior to the submission deadline indicated below and still be certified as an 8(a) Developmental Stage participant at the time of award (planned award date is October 6, 2016); have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, CA; and Phoenix, AZ Districts); (2) Be registered in the System for Award Management database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/; the SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; and VETS-4212 at http://www.dol.gov/vets/vets4212.htm (if not applicable, provide a statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,001 - $1,000,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under one of the following designated NAICS codes: 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction; 237110 Water, Sewer Line  and  Related Structures Construction; 237120 Oil, Gas Pipeline  and  Related Structures Construction; 237130 Power, Communication Line  and  Related Structures Construction; 237310 Highway, Street  and  Bridge Construction; 238160 Roofing; 238210 Electrical Contractors  and  Other Wiring Installation; 238220 Plumbing, Heating  and  Air-Conditioning; 238320 Painting  and  Wall Covering; 238330 Flooring; 238910 Site Preparation Contractors; 238990 All Other Specialty Trade Contractors within the last three years.

<DESC>Contract Title -  542-17-1-5125-0035 FY17 Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) Maintenance and Repairs

Background -  The Coatesville VAMC utilizes main power from the local utility PECO to supply the entire campus. However, there are frequent instances where the power fluctuates and the main lines are lost and generator power is utilized. There is a 3-60 second window where the equipment on the campus will not have any power. Additionally, there are frequent power surges and spikes that damage sensitive electronic equipment. To account for this, many critical pieces of equipment have been placed on uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).

This contract is to provide preventive maintenance and repair services on the Uninterruptible Power Supplies located at the Coatesville VAMC. 

General Tasks - This service agreement is for full maintenance and repair services on the UPS equipment listed below. The contractor shall provide 24/7/365 unlimited emergency repair and call-back repair services as well as preventative maintenance inspections (1 PM inspection per piece of equipment), labor, travel and all other materials to perform the checks for the UPS equipment listed in the SOW. This agreement will last through FY17.

The 682B is used on the A/M37T 20C mobile engine test stand and combines six data input channels (velocity or acceleration) with four tachometer input channels and DSP technology on a single ruggedized board. Serial Bus (IP 1553) communication and a 24V power requirement allows this package to be easily integrated into a test cell application. The data received by the input channels are streamed into eight data buffers which are then processed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into the frequency domain. The FFT data is processed to allow integration from Acceleration to Velocity, to Displacement, or no integration. Data may be displayed immediately or saved for later analysis/display. The spectrum data generated is available on the 1553 bus.</span></p>

<DESC><strong>Market Research - Sources Sought Notice</strong>
<p>U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center</p>
<p>Automated Standard Parts Library Application</p>
<p><br />1. Description of Intent:</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice. Army Contracting Command - Warren (ACC-WRN) is conducting a Market Survey to determine the level of interest among contractors in providing Automated Standard Parts Library Application. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking offerors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. All portions of this market survey are merely for market research purposes, subject to change at any time, and are in no way binding on the Government. Response to this RFI is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.</p>
<p>2. General Information:</p>
<p>The Government's explicit intent, in this sources sought notice (SSN), is to not receive from respondents any proprietary data, trade secrets, business sensitive information, or information considered CONFIDENTIAL under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905. The Government's constraint does not in any way relieve respondents from their responsibility to properly mark proprietary data when it is provided, in accordance with DFARS 252.227-7013, nor does it alleviate any requirement for the Government to protect marked data. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.</p>
<p>Respondents shall ensure that any material and data that is provided is marked appropriately to ensure proper handling of all information. Unless otherwise noted herein, anything submitted in response to this SSN will not be returned to the sender. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this SSN or results of information submitted, nor will the Government respond to telephone or email inquiries. NOTE: The Government is not asking you to develop or provide drawings or develop any technical data in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>3. Background:</p>
<p>TARDEC currently has an enterprise data management system currently utilizing the Windchill 10.2 product lifecycle management (PLM) software that supports TARDEC and numerous external stakeholders with an engineering-centric solution. Currently there are multiple folders on Windchill that are available for users that house duplicate CAD standard hardware parts in Creo with no consistent file naming convention. Also these current hardware libraries include parts with undesirable specification, material or coating. Due to the increase of CAD data uploaded on Windchill and the exponential increase of duplicate standard parts, finding an automated solution to creating and managing standard parts is becoming crucially important.</p>
<p><br />4. Scope of Capabilities Sought:</p>
<p>The scope of the capabilities sought include, but are not limited to: CAD Software Application Development, Windchill Interoperability, Process Analysis, Process Design, System Design, System Development, Verification and Validation, Infrastructure Design, and Training.</p>
<p>Following are additional examples of critical technical capabilities sought:</p>
<p>a. Plugin solution for CAD software applications including but not limited to, Creo, UG NX, CATIA, and Solidworks</p>
<p>b. Solution that allows us to generate on-demand standardized part numbers and CAD models for standard parts for American and international standards including, but not limited to ASME B18.24, AIA/NAS, SAE, MS, ISO, &amp; DIN</p>
<p>c. Solution that allows for interactive intuitive and iterative searches of parts libraries available on Windchill</p>
<p>d. Solution that allows for inserting selected configuration of standard parts into CAD software session</p>
<p>e. Solution that supports employing Creo start part files when creating models</p>
<p>f. Solution that maps appropriate material files into CAD models</p>
<p>g. Solution that assigns consistent and compliant file names to standard parts' CAD files per agreed upon file naming convention</p>
<p><br />5. Responses Due:</p>
<p>Electronic responses to this SSN must be received by close of business 21 October 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The objective of this RFI is to identify interested sources capable of developing a MESA Regional Training Forum. This work is envisioned to facilitate the development of a recurring (2-4 events per calendar year), regional training forum available to nations across the MESA that would bring together relevant parties from multiple countries to a Forum training event. The Forum will aim to: 1) provide topical and recurring training of importance and interest on the topics of BS&amp;S and biosurveillance (BSV) to countries across the region; 2) serve as the basis for the formation of networks of expertise across the region; and 3) support the premise of sustainability as it relates to CBEP engagement in MESA. Countries of interest in the region include those that are currently engaged by CBEP (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Jordan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Turkey) as well as countries not bilaterally engaged by CBEP at this time, including Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). <br />This RFI is not meant to prescribe specific solutions. Instead, the strategic plans developed should take into account existing BS&amp;S and BSV capacities within the region and provide training opportunities through which relevant government and academic institutions can enhance their national expertise, contributing to their ability to combat global biological threats.
<p>The project scope includes technical, training, management, and logistical support services required to improve disease surveillance and response capabilities and a sustainable workforce in the region. Training topics will vary based on the expressed desires of the participants, with consideration to CBEP mission and priorities; example topics or activities may include:</p>
<p>&bull; Disease diagnostic laboratory protocols and technology advances;<br />&bull; Sampling procedures, and sample handling and transport; <br />&bull; Field epidemiological training; <br />&bull; Biorisk Management (may include BS&amp;S best practices, biosafety cabinet certifier training; lab equipment maintenance and repair, etc.); <br />&bull; Bioinformatics; <br />&bull; Cross-border disease surveillance and response table top exercises (TTX);<br />&bull; Other timely/topical related trainings (i.e., Ebola, MERS-CoV, etc.).</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice - AG-0109-S-17-0001
<p>The Region 10 Regional Acquisition Management Office located in Juneau is posting this Sources Sought Notice pursuant to FAR Part 10 for market research purposes only. Responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition. Anticipated NAICS code is 481211, Non Scheduled Chartered Passenger Air Transportation. The small business size standard for NAICS code 481211 is 1,500 employees. If you believe another code is more applicable based on the description of the requirement, please indicate and state justification with your reply.</p>
<p>The anticipated requirement is for one (1) or more contract(s) for exclusive use boat and helicopter services for Forest Service field crews for housing and transport to remote field plots along the Southeast and Southcentral coasts of Alaska.</p>
<p>The Boat will be capable of supporting up to 12 Forest Service employees (and all field gear) to include providing food, lodging and office space. The boat shall also have a helideck capable of helicopter landings and transport. Helicopter shall be capable of transporting a five (5) person field crew (and field gear) from the boat to remote sites daily. Operations run seven (7) days/week for approximately 60 days per year during the summer season.</p>
<p>The Government is interested in industry's input in the viability of awarding two separate contracts to two separate entities (not operated as a joint venture, prime/subcontractor relationship, partnership, etc.). One contract would be for exclusive use boat services (requirements described below) and a second contract would be for exclusive use helicopter services. Questions include the following:</p>
<p>1. Would helicopter charter companies be willing and able to land on a boat operated and controlled by a company other than the helicopter charter company?<br />2. Would boat charter companies be willing and able to allow another company's helicopter to conduct operations on the boat's helicopter deck?<br />3. Are there specific liability concerns of which the Government should be aware in awarding and administering two separate contracts?</p>
<p><br />This market research will assist the government in determining whether to solicit for the required services as a single requirement to support both boat and helicopter operations or to solicit as two (2) separate requirements, one (1) for boat services and one (1) for helicopter services capable of maritime operations. Interested vendors are encouraged to demonstrate their ability to provide separate services (either boat OR helicopter) or both boat and helicopter services as a single operator, through partnerships, subcontracts, or joint ventures.</p>
<p>All interested vendors should notify this office, in writing, of their interest in this notice. Response due date is 24 October 2016 by 2pm Alaska time. Responses shall include the following information:</p>
<p>Identification of company, size status, DUNS number, and certifications. The Government is especially interested in capabilities of small businesses including HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Woman-Owned, etc.</p>
<p>Describe company's experience and capability of meeting requirements in the summary statement above.</p>
<p>Alternate NAICS information, if applicable.</p>
<p>Perceived risks/benefits of awarding a single contract vice two separate contracts.</p>
<p>There is no solicitation available at this time. The Forest Service does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. The Forest Service is interested in obtaining responses to this Sources Sought Notice from prospective contractors but no contractor shall be reimbursed for providing this information. Information provided in response to this request shall be provided in writing and include a point of contact name, phone and fax numbers and email address. Responses may be submitted via email to Marie Kanan at mkanan@fs.fed.us or by mail to USDA Forest Service, R10 Regional Office, Attention Marie Kanan, 709 W 9th Street, Juneau, AK 99801.</p>

<DESC>SUBJECT: Intent to Sole Source - Xerox Copier Lease, Supplies, and Servicing.

The National Park Service, Alaska Regional Office, intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price commercial item delivery order to Xerox Corporation (DUNS #039860122) against GSA Schedule GS-25F-0062L for leasing 2 multi-functional devices, inclusive of all consumable supplies, maintenance, and servicing for Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve (GLBA) located in Gustavus, Alaska 99826. 

Xerox is the only brand and manufacturer that can provide the multi-functional devices to GLBA to ensure the continuity of supplies, services, and equipment. GLBA currently has one device on contract through 06/30/2019. This procurement will expired at the same time to allow for full and open competition for future procurements. By continuing with the Xerox brand, the Park will be able to coordinate repairs, maintenance, and supplies for all machines, while minimizing the expense of multiple repair service technicians, travel costs, and down-time. 

The estimated magnitude of this project is less than $25,000.

This notice of intent is not a request for quotes, proposals, or bids. A determination not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Responses must be received no later than 12:00 PM, October 16, 2016 by sending an e-mail to rebecca_graham@nps.gov; however, any technical data received will be for the sole purpose of market research for future requirements.

<DESC>The requirement is sole source to General Electric (GE) to place the item(s) identified within the attached document Exhibit A under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA). 
Orders issued under this BOA and pursuant to this system shall be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The sole source for repair is not a small business. The set-aside status has been dissolved. The items contemplated for procurement or repair requires Government Source Approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only source(s) previously approved by the Government for the item(s) have been solicited.
 
The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you may submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP-WSS Source Approval Brochure for Repair. Additional information for submitting a Source Approval Request package can be obtained at:
https://www/navsup.navy.mil/ourteam/navsupwss/business_opps
These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based upon your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.
 Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at:  https//www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
  All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals, quotations, or capability statements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete with the proposed BOA based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   However, interested parties may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>[NOTE FOR CONTRACT SPECIALIST (Do Not Post this Note): Issue J&amp;A as Brand Name Notice of Intent as a "SPECIAL NOTICE" or SOURCE SOUGHT AMENDMENT to "W911KB-16-S-192A"]
<p>TITLE: NOTICE OF INTENT TO INCLUDE BRAND NAME COMPONENTS IN A FUTURE CONSTRUCTION REPAIR CONTRACT UNDER NAICS 238210, FTG, AK</p>
<p>SUBJECT: THIS NOTICE IS MARKET RESEARCH TO SUPPORT INTENT TO INCLUDE BRAND NAME SOLE SOURCE SPECIFICATION IN AN FY17 CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, TITLED, FTG192 IDT SWITCHGEAR BOX FACILITY, FORT GREELY, ALASKA. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. Provisions set forth by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) &sect; 6.302-1(c)(1) authorizes the use of brand name only supplies as part of an acquisition when supplies may be deemed to be available only from one or a limited number of sources, and when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. As such, for the purposes described hereunder and in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, coupled with the Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District intends to issue a competitive solicitation that will include brand name only specification items. Specifically, the contractor awarded the competitive construction contract will be required to purchase the following brand name Critical Systems in support of the planned construction renovation acquisition:</p>
<p>a) Low-voltage circuit breakers for an EATON Type FDE with adjustable LSIG, EATON Type KD Optim Trip, and Siemens Type JC with 576 LSI Trip Units</p>
<p>b) GE RX3i PLC; Power Control and Monitoring System (PCMS) network utilizes the GE RX3i and all individual building power components are required to communicate and integrate with the PCMS system and head-end.</p>
<p>c) Hirschmann Mach 1000/RS-20 network switch; Power Control and Monitoring System (PCMS) network switch is a Hirschmann Mach 1000/RS-20 network switch and all individual building power components are required to communicate and integrate with the PCMS head end.</p>
<p>d) SEL specification for a SEL-751A and SEL-411L relays; site-wide electrical coordination system and Power Control and Monitoring System (PCMS) network is currently configured to operate with SEL relays and all individual building power components are required to communicate and integrate with the PCMS network and head end.<br />e) Alerton VLX Controller; Site Control and Monitoring System (SCMS) controller is an Alerton VLX Controller and all individual building components are required to communicate and integrate with the SCMS head end.</p>
<p>f) Cisco ME-3600X-24FS-M/IE-3000-8TC network switch; Site Control and Monitoring System (SCMS) NETWORK Switch is a Cisco ME-3600X-24FS-M and all individual building components are required to communicate and integrate with the SCMS head end.</p>
<p>g) APC specification for a Symmetra LX UPS designed for business-critical applications in server rooms and network closets.</p>
<p>The use of the original manufacturer of materials and components is required to prevent issues of system functionality and extensive additional costs. The use of any other manufacturer would cause a need to replace in essence complete parts and accessories thus creating complete new systems. Therefore, the future contract will need to use brand name descriptions peculiar to one manufacturer for a specific system with whom a turn-key solution can be provided meeting all government requirements.<br />The government has already developed plans and specifications for the planned construction acquisition, and intends to utilize full and open competitive procedures for the future solicitation/contract of the construction project requiring the brand name only components. The future solicitation will be numbered as W911KB-17-R-0019. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the project is 238210 with a small business size in dollars of $15M.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and submit clearly articulated product information, vendor/distributor information. Product information lacking the particular features that do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, this agency's needs cannot be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice of intent to include brand name component within the construction acquisition is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to include a statement of brand name or equal for the planned future competitive construction procurement.</p>
<p>Vendors who offer the above items which can meet all of the above functional criteria are invited to respond to this notice. Responses must include the following information:<br />(1) Identification of the manufacturer's name, address, and country of product manufacture.<br />(2) Fully detailed specification sheets.<br />(3) Narrative addressing how your product meets the salient features listed above.</p>
<p>Interested firms may submit their interest and information from the date of this notice until 2:00 PM Alaska Time on 21 OCTOBER 2016 via email to POC noted below. Any electronically submitted files by Email CANNOT EXCEED this Agency's size limit of 10MB (includes email and its attachment); files exceeding this size will be denied access to our email inbox. It is the responsibility of your firm to determine the size of its electronic file. The posting of this Notice satisfies the provisions set forth at FAR Subpart 5.2 for notice of intent to include brand name specifications in planned construction acquisition. The Point of Contact for this Notice is Julie McLaughlin. Send responses to U. S. Army Engineer District, Alaska, ATTN: CEPOA-CT (McLaughlin), <br />P. O.

The Edward Hines Jr VA Medical Center has a need for a gait analysis system called the "Qualisys". The system is composed of multiple parts; two CPUs (computing devices), multiple cameras, multiple pressure and force plates, calibraters, cables, and mounting devices (tripods).  Physicians will use this technology to get a distinctive picture of a patient's specific gait/ambulatory impairment which helps the physician determine the best treatment plan or therapy regimen for that individual. This equipment is particularly useful for treating stroke, amputation, and other gait disorders.
The Qualisys (formerly Codamotion) is a "stand-alone" gait analysis system consisting of several monitors/markers, pressurized scales, and cameras that will take pictures and detect exertion/force initiated by the patient; generating an individualized report that will assist physicians with determining which treatment plan or therapies would be most conducive to that patient's recovery. The system is mobile; and can be moved from one therapy gym to another.
Below is a list of the individual components:

4.0 	BACKGROUND
4.1	PROBLEM STATEMENT
VA has identified a lack of standardization in processes and quality practices for background investigation and reinvestigation initiation and adjudication. Challenges in these activities have resulted in:
"	Lack of centralized automated system of record; 
"	Lack of enterprise business processes for investigations and re-investigations; 
"	Inconsistent storage and safeguarding of sensitive data (e.g., Microsoft Excel files on local and shared drives); 
"	Extended investigation processing times, leading to prolonged onboarding process; 
"	Lack of insight into status of investigations and reinvestigations; 
"	Lack of quality standards for adjudication processes and decisions; 
"	Untimely identification and processing for reinvestigations; 
"	Weakened security posture across the enterprise, putting the VA at risk for data breaches and other security threats; 
"	Systemic material weakness discovered through Office of the Inspector General audits (described below) hinders VA in achieving specific requirements and controls; 
"	Favorable adjudicative decisions may be made in cases where further analysis may reflect that an applicant investigation or reinvestigation could be deemed unfavorable; and 
"	VA Subjects maintaining favorable suitability status without proper verification after the initial investigation expires.
4.2	PROJECT BACKGROUND
The mission of the Personnel Security and Suitability (PSS) Program Management Office (PMO) is to aid VA in suitability and fitness determinations that are properly made for VA Subjects (Employees, Contractors, Trainees, Volunteers, and Affiliates) for the performance of duties in the service of Veterans and to safeguard VA Subjects and Veteran data. This mission also includes issuance of department-wide personnel security and suitability program policy, oversight, and training that supports the safety and security of our nation's Veterans, visitors, staff, and facilities. In order to necessitate the fulfillment of this mission and determine that the desired resources are on-boarded, the PSS PMO is seeking to improve the background investigation and onboarding process by instituting a centralized case management system, VA-CABS, and standardizing processes across the VA enterprise. The need for VA-CABS was established by the PSS PMO through participation in several VA initiatives, including: the remediation of Continuous Readiness in Information Security Program (CRISP) material weakness (recommendations 2006-03 and 2006-04), Centralized Adjudication Facility (CAF) Working Group, and the MyVA Security & Preparedness Support Services Quick Wins. 
In addition, the PSS PMO evaluated the current business processes to determine that there were variations across VA for investigations and adjudication practices, processes, tools/systems, and responsibilities between user groups. These discoveries and variations also contribute to the CRISP findings, related to material weaknesses in the investigations and reinvestigations for the VA workforce. Due to these variations and stated VA initiatives, the PSS PMO recommended implementing an enterprise case management system, VA-CABS. The recommended solution shall help the VA enterprise with streamlined background investigation and reinvestigation processes. This solution shall modify processes while improving the quality, transparency, and accountability for adjudications, as well as help remediate the material weaknesses. 
Overall, the implementation of the solution and concurrent initiatives (e.g., compliance and oversight, training) will have a positive impact on Veterans through allowing quicker and more efficient onboarding of personnel that serve Veterans. VA-CABS is required to resolve the existing inefficiencies in the current background investigation and adjudication process by increasing communication between user groups and streamlining the exchange of information between systems. 
Additional benefits shall include: 
"	Deployment of an Enterprise Solution - Provide PSS stakeholders with one system/solution and utilizes standardized processes and workflows for adjudication. 
"	More Efficient Investigation and Reinvestigation Processing - Provide PSS stakeholders with more clearly defined workflows for a case. 
"	Improved Audit Results - Allow PSS stakeholders to more efficiently remediate CRISP audit findings for investigations as well identify reinvestigations prior to future audits. 
"	Standardization of Adjudication Processes - Provide a more standardized framework for processing and recording adjudications with governance and incorporation of the oversight and compliance and training programs.

Current State: Security personnel manually conduct fingerprinting and entry of Subject data attributes into a fingerprint-capture system. Personnel access Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) systems (PIPS/CVS) manually to pull and review data relating to fingerprint results, verify background investigations and adjudications. Personnel push or enter an adjudicative decision into PIPS/CVS and initiate e-QIP. Individual HR stations maintain separate mechanisms, such as spreadsheets, to track background investigation status and reinvestigation monitoring. Required documents are manually maintained through scanning or hard file management. Action letters are drafted and emailed/mailed by security specialists.
4.3	SYSTEM OVERVIEW
VA-CABS shall provide an automated solution to manage background investigation data across the VA enterprise for VA Subjects as an authoritative data source for background investigation case information. The system shall integrate with both internal (e.g., Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) Onboarding solution) and external systems (e.g., Office of Personnel Management [OPM]). 

VA-CABS shall provide the following capabilities: 
"	Receive identity data for VA Subjects from ICAM Onboarding solution and utilize it to establish a VA Subject profile within VA-CABS. The currently deployed ICAM Onboarding solution is the Computer Associates Identity Management product. 
"	Assign prescreening tasks and background investigation cases to appropriate security personnel to perform investigative and adjudicative duties. 
"	Facilitate and trigger associated processes for prescreening, background investigation initiation, and / or adjudication in VA-CABS. 
"	Integration with OPM to automatically receive VA Subject's data in VA-CABS. 
"	The figure below depicts proposed integration points and functions at a high level between VA-CABS, integrating systems, data sources, and users as a part of the Concept of Operations (CONOPS).

	Interface	Description	Data Flow	Data Sent by VA-CABS	Data Received by VA-CABS
 	ICAM Onboarding solution
	The ICAM Onboarding solution will assist with VA Subject onboarding and serve as the authoritative data source for identity data for VA-CABS. The solution is integrated with HR-Smart to provide employee data and will be the authoritative source for contractor data, whereas eCMS is used for Contract data. In addition, the ICAM Onboarding solution will integrate with the HSPD-12 system for PIV Card issuance. The solution will be integrated with VA-CABS at IOC.	Bi-directional	VA-CABS shall send status and date information for the following workflows:  Special Agreement Check (SAC), e-QIP, background investigation, and suitability adjudicative determination. 
VA-CABS shall send VA Subject's physical identity attributes required for PIV issuance.	VA-CABS shall receive the identity attributes that VA-CABS requires to create or update a profile for a VA Subject. 
 	OPM	The OPM conducts background investigations for VA Subjects and provides a report of investigation (ROI) to the VA. The solution will be integrated with VA-CABS at IOC.	Bi-directional	In a Future State, VA-CABS shall send suitability adjudicative determination data to be recorded in CVS and PIPS.	VA-CABS shall receive SAC results, background investigation statuses, and Reports of Investigation (ROI) upon OPM's scheduled document transfers.
 
4.4	PROCESS OVERVIEW
The table and workflow outlined in Table 2 summarizes the high-level process for a VA Subject to be deemed suitable / fit to work for or on behalf of VA along with the associated timeline. With automated processes, VA subjects will have the required suitability determination by entry on duty. This determination will then facilitate creation of system accounts and issuance of VA credentials (such as PIV). The process flow also depicts on-going monitoring of VA Subject investigations for reinvestigation.

The process steps listed below in the table are based on the following assumptions:
"	A VA Subject has accepted a tentative offer and / or has been assigned to the appropriate contract with VA to initiate security and suitability processes;
"	The required user identity attributes have been sent to VA-CABS by the ICAM Onboarding solution;
"	The VA Subject has received a notification for the fingerprinting process at their local facility;
"	An investigation is scheduled prior to/or close to entry on duty (EOD) or beginning of work performance.

Note: The proposed timelines start when a VA Subject visits a VA facility to be fingerprinted. In addition, some of these tasks may occur simultaneously.
Table 2: VA-CABS Workflow for a VA Subject
VA-CABS Workflow for a VA Subject
Timeline
(Business Days)	Description
Day 1	The VA Subject visits a VA facility to provide fingerprints. A Security Assistant logs into VA-CABS, searches for appropriate VA Subject, captures the VA Subject fingerprints and submits them to OPM for a Special Agreement Check (SAC). The fingerprints are stored within VA-CABS and attached to the VA Subject Profile.
Day 2	OPM sends results back to VA-CABS using the eDelivery capability.
Days 3 - 5	A Security Specialist adjudicates the VA Subject's SAC.
Day 5	VA-CABS sends the SAC adjudication result to ICAM Onboarding solution.
Day 6	A Security Assistant/Security Specialist evaluates the VA Subject for reciprocity or debarment. If VA Subject is not eligible for reciprocity and has no bars, the Security Assistant/Specialist initiates e-QIP for the VA Subject.
Days 7 - 12	VA Subject completes and submits e-QIP.
Day 12	A Security Assistant/Security Specialist reviews the e-QIP and releases it to OPM.
Days 13 - 15 	OPM receives e-QIP and schedules the investigation and sends the investigation type and date to VA-CABS.
Day 16	VA-CABS receives notice that investigation has been scheduled by OPM via eDelivery. Note: VA Subject is now ready to begin work and have a PIV card issued.
Day 16 - 106	OPM performs investigation on the VA Subject and sends investigation data to VA-CABS. A Security Specialist reviews data to render an adjudicative determination for the VA Subject as favorable or unfavorable (Goal of completion within 90 days).

<DESC>Walter Reed National Military Medical Center has a requirement for upgraded equipment components for the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) system to support existing clinical treatments. The government intends to procure this contract on a sole source basis from Motek Medical. The preliminary market research indicates that, as the manufacturer of the system, only Motek Medical can provide the specific products and service required because only this company possesses the proprietary software and firmware, replacement parts, troubleshooting equipment/capabilities, factory trained certified technicians, and proprietary tools and processes required to repair/maintain the equipment. Motek Medical specifically designed this system in 2010 in support of the Department of Research and Rehabilitation. The CAREN system enhances the functional rehabilitative capabilities of patients receiving care in the Department of Rehabilitation. The system is unique and requires certified technicians and licensing to perform required maintenance. <br /><br /><br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotations and a solicitation will not be issued. Prospective offerors are advised that because there are no other known sources, the agency has authorized the procurement of these services under other than full and open competition under FAR 6.3. However, interested responsible sources may submit a capability statement for the agency's consideration in determining whether a competitive procurement should be conducted in the future for this service. A copy of the Justification and Approval will be posted no later than 14 days after award. <br />

Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805, the Management and Operating Contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).&nbsp;&nbsp;BEA is seeking parties interested in potentially entering into a license agreement for the purpose of commercializing the technology described below.&nbsp;&nbsp;BEA does not make any representations, provide any warranties, or otherwise endorse or guarantee the suitability of this patent to a licensee's specific needs.&nbsp;</span></p>

OSIRIS measures, analyzes, and filters gamma-ray spectral information for on-site inspections under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). OSIRIS software includes a &ldquo;data filter&rdquo; that limits user information to seventeen CTBT-relevant fission product isotopes. Raw spectral data and information on other radioisotopes is not revealed to users, to minimize the potential intrusiveness of the OSIRIS gamma-ray spectroscopy system.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> Unlike other gamma-ray spectral analysis programs, OSIRIS filters the information presented to the user, limiting it to the seventeen CTBT-relevant gamma-ray peaks, calibration isotopes like europium-152, and a few natural background peaks, for example, potassium-40.&nbsp; The natural background peak information is presented to help assure the user of normal spectrometer operation.<br /> <br /> During data acquisition, OSIRIS analyzes the incoming gamma-ray spectrum in real time, using the INL legacy GAUSS Algorithms to search for peaks, divide the spectrum into peak regions, and perform nonlinear least-squares fits of gamma-ray peaks in each region. [3] From the peak fits, OSIRIS calculates the energy and net area of each gamma-ray peak, and, in turn, the emitting radioisotope is determined from the energy and the radioactivity is computed from the net area, for each gamma-ray peak identified in the spectrum.<br /> <br /> OSIRIS controls an ORTEC HPGe gamma-ray spectrometer, including startup, energy and peak-width calibration, data acquisition, and shutdown.&nbsp; The OSIRIS hardware includes an ORTEC Trans-SPEC-DX-100T mechanically-cooled HPGe detector, requiring no liquid nitrogen, and a digital signal-processing multichannel analyzer1. </span></p>

<SUBJECT>Defueled Ex-ENTERPRISE (CVN 65) Reactor Plant Dismantling and Disposal Request for Information (RFI)
<SOLNBR>N00024-16-R-4212
<RESPDATE>090616
<CONTACT>Herbert R. (RAY) Duff, Phone 202-781-2129, Email CVN65_RFI@navy.mil - Emily J. Stepien, Contract Specialist, Phone 2027815047, Email emily.stepien@navy.mil
<DESC>Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing this Request for Information (RFI) from all potential sources who may be interested in dismantling the reactor plants and disposing of all resulting low-level radioactive waste from the inactivated and defueled Ex ENTERPRISE (CVN 65) starting in early Fiscal Year 2019. Information on safe and cost efficient methods is desired to inform potential decisions and environmental evaluation for disposal of the reactor plants from this ship. This effort excludes the work contemplated in Pre-solicitation Notice N00024-16-R-4207, Complete Dismantlement of non-Nuclear Sections and Construction of Propulsion Space Section (PSS) for ex-CVN 65, posted July 25, 2016 to FedBizOpps.gov.
<p>Respondents should describe how they would propose to dismantle the reactor plants, package and transport the resulting components and radioactive waste, and ship the resulting waste to authorized low-level waste disposal sites. This work would be accomplished either before, during, or after demilitarizing, dismantling, and recycling of the remaining non-radioactive sections of the ship.</p>
<p>The Navy will provide waterborne delivery of a floating center section of the ship containing the reactor plants to the respondents chosen site. Successful completion includes the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste, disposal of all other waste, and recycling of recyclable materials. All handling of radioactive materials must be performed by a company licensed by either the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or a State under agreement with the NRC. All reactor plant dismantlement, radioactive waste disposal, and non radioactive ship dismantling and recycling work must be accomplished within the United States of America.</p>
<p>Dismantlement of the reactor plants and non-radioactive sections of the ship requires identification, control, and disposal of regulated polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) waste, asbestos, and other hazardous materials typical of those used in Navy ship construction in the 1950s, per all applicable Federal, state, and local regulations. Non-radioactive hazardous materials are expected to be similar to materials in ex-FORRESTAL (CV 59) and other aircraft carriers that have been or are currently being recycled.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies or to otherwise contract for any supply or service. This notice is for receipt of information for planning purposes only and does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. The Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies for disposal of the defueled reactor plants. Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran owned businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate. Respondents to any subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP) related to this RFI must be able to demonstrate they can provide facilities, equipment, and a workforce capable of performing this work. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. <br />&emsp;<br />Responses:</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should describe a recommended approach to dismantlement of the reactor plants, radioactive waste disposal, and recycling of non-radioactive ship structure, distributed systems, and equipment. At contract completion, all material shall be properly disposed of or recycled, as appropriate. Include in the responses supporting material that allows for an effective understanding of the respondent's competence, experience, and overall capabilities to respond to NAVSEA requirements that may arise in the future.</p>
<p>Respondents should endeavor to provide as much of the following information as possible. In considering the questions below, the following information is made available:</p>
<p>-No greater than Class-C radioactive waste is expected to be generated during dismantlement of the reactor plants.<br />-Most radioactive components to be removed are expected to be smaller and lighter than those in civilian power plants. For consideration of potential rail or road shipments to disposal sites, the largest single component can be estimated to weigh approximately 305,000 pounds and is approximately 115 inches wide prior to being placed in a shipping configuration.<br />-Classified components may be assumed to be disposed of in an authorized disposal site provided they are either disposed of in secure packages or encased in a concrete disposal cell.<br />-Dismantlement work will occur at a non-Government facility the respondent owns or has access to, and shall have been certified to minimum security clearance at the CONFIDENTIAL level obtained from the Defense Security Services (DSS). <br />-Engineering and production personnel involved in reactor plant dismantlement shall be U.S. citizens and shall have or obtain security clearances at the CONFIDENTIAL level at minimum. All other employees, subcontractors, and other persons shall be U.S. citizens prior to obtaining access to the vessel and/or the area of the facility where the vessel and/or reactor plants will be dismantled.<br />-Just as the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Department of Energy collaborate with private industry to manufacture and assemble the components in these reactor plants, the Navy would cooperate with private industry as necessary to plan and execute disposal. <br />-Since dismantlement and disposal of a defueled aircraft carrier is not qualitatively different from dismantlement and disposal of civilian reactor plants, current or prior experience in construction or maintenance of Navy nuclear-powered ships is not required.<br />-Regulation of radiological work would be in accordance with NRC or Agreement State license requirements.</p>
<p><br />Questions:</p>
<p>1.What would be the most economical and/or most expedient method for dismantlement and disposal of the defueled reactor plants while maintaining safe control of radioactive materials and occupational safety?<br />2.Would it be more cost effective to perform reactor plant dismantlement prior to recycling of the remainder of the ship or after the ship has been partially recycled to produce a smaller, floating center section containing the eight reactor plants?<br />3.Would availability of adjacent sections of the intact ship and hangar deck above the reactor plants be useful as a staging site and work space during performance of reactor plant dismantlement? Would the availability of this potential work space on the ship reduce the shore infrastructure needed to handle, package, and ship out radioactive waste materials?<br />4.Which portions of the work could be performed with the ship waterborne? In a dry dock? On a heavy lift ship/floating dry dock? Or combination?<br />5.If possible, how would the work be performed with the ship waterborne? In a dry dock? On a heavy lift ship/floating dry dock? Or combination?<br />6.How long would the work take if it was performed with the ship waterborne? In a dry dock? On a heavy lift ship/floating dry dock? Or combination?<br />7.Where are the facilities located that could support this work? What are the capabilities of these facilities?<br />8.What cost information would be available for the performance of this work? In particular, how would the cost of this work compare with the published cost estimates for dismantlement and disposal of large civilian reactor plants? (See NRC Decommissioning Funding Status Reports - http://www.nrc.gov/waste/decommissioning/finan-assur/bi-decom-reports.html) <br />9.Concerning radioactive materials:<br />a.What experience does the respondent have for handling and disposal of radioactive and mixed materials? Further, what experience does the respondent have in transporting these materials under NRC and/or Department of Transportation requirements?<br />b.What current licenses does the respondent hold in these areas or would the respondent required to obtain? Copies of existing licenses should be provided, where possible.<br />10.Concerning regulated PCB waste, asbestos, and other hazardous materials:<br />a.What experience does the respondent have for handling and disposal of these materials? Further, what experience does the respondent have in transporting these materials under Department of Transportation requirements?<br />b.What current licenses does the respondent hold in these areas or would the respondent be required to obtain? Copies of existing licenses should be provided, where possible.</p>
<p>Navy Carrier Program Executive Office (PMS 312) requests responses by 2:00pm (EDT) 30 working days following issuance of this RFI. Submissions will be accepted after this date; however, feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEA's strategic planning. Information should be emailed to Mr. Herbert R. (Ray) Duff at CVN65_RFI@navy.mil or herbert.r.duff@navy.mil with the subject line: "Defueled Aircraft Carrier Disposal RFI". Information provided shall be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies, and its program management support contractors without the permission of the provider.</p>

<p>Architect Engineer and Construction Contracting Industry Day for Repair, Maintenance, Construction and Design Services for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Europe District Projects for Israeli Ministry of Defense (MOD) Facilities in Israel.</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 236220 - Commercial and Institutional Building Construction</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Europe District, in conjunction with the Israeli MoD intend to be hold two (2) Industry Days to present the Israel Foreign Military Sales (FMS) - Construction Program. Presentations will be provided on future USACE Israel FMS construction Best Value contracts and the existing FY15 Israel Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).</p>
<p>The objective of the industry days is to provide information to interested United States construction contractors and architect engineer firms on the general scope of USACE design build and design bid build projects within Israel; typical infrastructure and facilities being procured; potential repair, maintenance and construction opportunities to support MoD facilities in Israel; as well as information on the solicitation and proposal process for best value and the FY15 Israel MATOC. All briefings will be presented in English with no translations.</p>
<p>Currently the Israel FMS Construction Program has $400,000,000 in on-going construction projects and $165,000,000 in Pre-award actions. The Program projects six (6) to ten (10) Best Value acquisitions ranging from $15M to $250M and approximately thirty (30) $1M to $15M additional task orders on the FY15 Israel MATOC over the next 2 years.</p>
<p>The FY15 Israel MATOC permits bringing on additional United States Contractor(s) under the On-Ramp procedures as planned for in the original Indefinite Deliver Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Solicitation W012GB-14-R-0030. Solicitation W912GB-17-R-0002 will be posted on FedBizOpps immediately after the completion of the Industry Days to solicit interested Contractors to submit Best Value proposals.</p>
<p>The FY15 Israel MATOC is a $249.5M construction IDIQ with a base year ($49.9M) and four (4) option years ($49.9M each). Six (6) contracts were awarded on 18 Jun 2015. The contracts are currently in Option Year 1 with Option Year 2 to be exercised in Jun 2017. The number of current active contracts is five (5). The On-Ramp procedures as provided in the initial solicitation and contracts awarded are:</p>
<p>"The Government reserves the right to re-open competition at any time during the term of the contract. The KO intends to periodically review the need for additional Contractors during the contract period of performance (PoP). If it is determined to be in the Government's best interest to add Contractors, an on-ramp may be executed. When an on-ramp is used, the Government will advertise the reopening of the competition on FedBizOpps. All new awardees shall meet the criteria established in the initial solicitation. The evaluation and selection of awardees for any on-ramp will be the same as the evaluation and award criteria used for the initial basic contract awards. The anticipated number of awards will be announced in the reopening announcement posted to FedBizOpps; however the PCO has the discretion to award more or fewer contracts than the number anticipated in the solicitation depending upon the quality of the offers received."</p>
<p>"Any Contractor that received a basic contract award shall not re-compete. The new awardee(s) will compete with any existing or remaining Contractors for all task orders. Any additions due to on-ramps will not impact the contract ceiling. The ordering period for new awardees will not extend the overall maximum term of the original contract, nor shall it re-establish the contract base period. The new awardee(s) will be eligible to compete for future task order requests for proposal issued against the basic IDIQ contract. The Government will not consider unsolicited request for additional Contractors."</p>

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>* SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>* Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />* Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>* SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>* Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />* Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.</p>

<p>*<br />Configuration Change Management - Engineering Change Proposal, Requests<br />for Variance (Deviation or Waiver) February 2015<br />1.&nbsp; Requirements<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp; The Configuration Change Management section of SAE EIA-649-1<br />Configuration Management Requirement for Defense Contracts, Paragraph<br />3.3, shall be used for Configuration Control of material purchased under<br />this contract.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Furnished item(s) shall conform to the approved configuration<br />requirements/revision specified, unless a Pre-Production Request for<br />Variance (deviation) or a Post-Production Request for Variance (waiver),<br />is processed and approved as provided by Paragraph 3. in this Standard<br />Text Object (STO).&nbsp; Hereafter, the term "Request for Variance (RFV)"<br />will also include Requests for Deviations and Waivers.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The definitions from EIA-649-1 apply to items being procured under<br />this solicitation/contract, with the following clarification of<br />Deviation &amp; Waiver:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp; Pre-Production RFV (previously known as deviation) requests<br />permission to produce a product that does not conform to contract<br />requirements/documentation for a limited amount of time and for<br />specified effectivity.&nbsp; (A deviation differs from an engineering change<br />in that an approved engineering change requires corresponding revision<br />of the item's current approved configuration documentation, whereas a<br />deviation does not.).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Post-Production RFV (previously known as waiver) requests<br />approval of product found during manufacture, or after having been<br />submitted for Government inspection or acceptance, that departs from<br />specified requirements, but nevertheless is considered suitable for use<br />"as is" or after repair by an approved method.</p>

For ECPs, Specification Change Notices (SCNs) or RFV, the<br />Contractor must submit the applicable documentation listed in<br />sub-paragraphs D.(1) through D.(4)to the Administrative Contracting<br />Officer(ACO), with an information copy to the Procuring Contracting<br />Officer (PCO).&nbsp; Failure to submit a complete legible package may result<br />in return of the ECP/RFV without processing.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Documentation listed in Paragraph 3.3.1 (for ECPs), 3.3.2<br />(RFV), 3.3.3 (for SCNs) or 3.3.4 (for Notices of Revision (NORs)) of the<br />latest revision of EIA-649-1.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) DD Form 1692 (current revision) for ECP.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; DD Form 1694 (current revision) for RFV.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; DD Form 1695 (current revision) for NOR.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; DLA's responsibilities:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp; Upon receipt of the ECP or RFV, the PCO will ensure that the<br />applicable product specialist receives the copy from DCMA.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Within five (5) working days from the date of receipt of the<br />Contractor's ECP or RFV from DCMA, the PS must submit the requests and<br />any supporting documentation via a 339 to the appropriate Engineering<br />Support Activity (ESA), when applicable.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Routine ECPs will be processed within 90 days from receipt by<br />the ESA.&nbsp; RFVs will be evaluated and processed within 30 days from<br />receipt by the ESA or as negotiated with the ESA.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; The contractor will be notified in writing of approval by<br />the return of an approved copy of the ECP or RFV.&nbsp; Approval will be<br />reflected by signature of the contracting activity or a review activity<br />specifically identified in the contract.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; The contractor will be notified in writing of disapproval<br />including reason(s) for disapproval.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; For an approved RFV or an approved ECP, when the request affects the<br />Contract, a modification will be issued to the contract incorporating<br />the applicable requirement changes.&nbsp; Only a Contracting Officer is<br />authorized to issue a modification incorporating the approved RFV and/or<br />ECP.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Questions regarding the status of previously submitted ECP or RFV<br />should be directed to the PCO.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The submission of an ECP or RFV by the Contractor does not affect<br />the required delivery date of the contract.&nbsp; If a delivery date change<br />is needed, it must be negotiated with the Contracting Officer and<br />documented via modification to the contract.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; The period of time for evaluation and approval/disapproval of an ECP<br />and/or a RFV, as specified in Paragraph 4. C., shall not constitute<br />excusable delay in the performance of this Contract by the Contractor or<br />in any way relieve the contractor from compliance with the contract<br />delivery schedule.&nbsp; The submission of an ECP and/or RFV by the<br />Contractor shall not preclude the Government from exercising its rights<br />under any clause of the Contract.&nbsp; (End)</p>

<RESPDATE>101716
<CONTACT>Jonathan M. Lear, Contracting Officer, Email john.lear@nih.gov
<DESC>Description: Much of the research conducted at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Division of Intramural Research (DIR) involves the use of Drosophila (the common fruit fly). Drosophila is considered a model organism in the field of biology as its genetic makeup closely mirrors that of humans. By closely studying the Drosophila in controlled experiments, researchers are able to anticipate how various diseases and their antidotes are manifest in human populations on a cellular level. As such, the Drosophila presents a unique opportunity to DIR researchers who seek to better understand the effects of cardiovascular diseases and sleep disorders in humans.
<p>In order to obtain statistically significant data from experiments involving Drosophila, DIR researchers must maintain a highly controlled environment in which to observe the flies. One major environmental factor is diet. Current Drosophila colonies under observation are extremely sensitive to even the slightest alterations in diet. It is therefore imperative that these Drosophila receive precise formulas according to the needs of the experiments. Historically, the DIR has produced Drosophila food in-house. However, due to recent personnel changes and other budgetary restraints, the DIR can no-longer support in-house food production. Consequently, the DIR must out-source its food production to a contractor capable of meeting the researchers' exact needs.</p>
<p>The DIR is in need of precisely formulated food to administer to its Drosophila populations. Drosophila are used in many cross-sectional, longitudinal and case-control studies throughout the DIR. As a result, the Drosophila must receive consistent nourishment so as to prevent variance in studies. Specifically, the DIR requires weekly shipments of food in addition to ad-hoc/emergency shipments upon request.</p>
<p>(i)	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>* SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>* Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />* Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.</p>

<DESC>QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS: <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions and Answers for Solicitation # HSFE06-17-Q-0717 <br /></span></strong>ASL Interpreter Services and CART Services<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1.</strong> Reference: Statement of Work (SOW), Section 3.0, Scope, Paragraph 5, Page 2 <br /></span><br />Question: Industry standards allow the interpreter to bill for the full duration of the assignment with less than 1 business days' notice. Would you be able to amend the solicitation to meet these standards? <br /><br />Answer: The solicitation will not be amended. ASL on-site Interpreters are allowed to bill for the hours of 8am - 6pm, less &frac12; hour for lunch for a total of 9.5 hours, Monday through Friday and for the hours of 8am - 12pm on Saturdays. Any extended hours will be reimbursed for actual hours worked. <br /><br /><strong>2.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reference: Statement of Work (SOW), Section 3.0, Scope, Paragraph 2, Page 1<br /></span><br />Question: CART and sign language services are priced differently. Are we able to quote a different rate for each of those services?<br /><br />Answer: Yes. <br /><br /><strong>3.</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Reference: Notice of Solicitation<br /></span><br />Question: Does a responding agency need to provide a quote for both CART and sign language to obtain an award or can a response only include one of those services?<br /><br />Answer: Yes, FEMA anticipates awarding one contract for the combined requirement.
<p><strong>4.</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Reference: Statement of Work (SOW), Section 3.0, Scope, Paragraph 2, Page 1<br /><br /></span>Question: Would Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) or Remote CART be an option and if so would you allow separate pricing for those services?<br /><br />Answer: Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) or Remote CART is not FEMA's preferred method for CART services. The CART services are on-call only with a not to exceed of 200 hours. <br /><br /><strong>5.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reference: Statement of Work (SOW), Section 3.0, Scope, Paragraph 5, Page 2</span> <br /><br />Question: Can you clarify the scope? Would 5 interpreters be required Monday through Saturday from 8am - 6pm or would this requirement be subject to change?<br /><br />Answer: The scope includes 5 ASL interpreters to be on-site Monday through Friday, 8am until 6pm. Monday through Friday, interpreters will work a 10 hour day with a &frac12; hour lunch. Time will be compensated for 9.5 hours. Saturday hours are 8am - 12pm, but may be extended as necessary. Interpreters will be compensated for 4 hours, no lunch, unless extended hours are required. If more than 4 hours of service is required, interpreters will be compensated for actual hours worked that exceed the regular 4 hour day.<br /><br /><strong>6.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reference: Statement of Work (SOW) Section 6.0, Evaluation of Services, Page 4<br /><br /></span>Question: Can you clarify that if the interpreter was dismissed early that the cancelation policy would apply and the full time could be invoiced? <br /><br />Answer: Dismissal in this SOW pertains to deficiencies in performance, ethical standards, dress code, timeliness, or other behavior or performance standards/expectations. If an interpreter is dismissed for a deficiency, FEMA will compensate the vendor only for the actual hours worked, by that interpreter, on the day they were dismissed.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>7.</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reference: Statement of Work (SOW), Section 3.0, Scope, Reimbursement for</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Services - Ad Hoc Interpreter Requests, Page 2<br /><br /></span>Question: Assuming a modification is not made to allow for a full 1 business day cancelation policy can you clarify the billing allowed if a request was canceled with between 4 hours and 24 hours notice.<br /><br />Answer: The FEMA Project Officer will do their best to give adequate notice of cancelation on all ad-hoc service requests. If cancelation is between 4 hours and 24 hours' notice, the vendor shall be reimbursed for two (2) hours.<br /><br /><strong>8.</strong> Question: Can you confirm when services would begin/when the contract would be awarded?<br /><br />Answer: The vendor shall be allowed reasonable "ramp-up" time after award of contract. Award of contractor is upon completion of evaluation of offers.<br /><br /><strong>9</strong>. Question: Is this a follow-on requirement? If so, could you please provide the incumbent contract number for this opportunity? If not, is this a new requirement?<br /><br />Answer: Yes, the incumbent is Translation Solutions, HSFE70-16-J-0294.</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers:<br />&nbsp;
<p>1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you provide a tax exemption certificate?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Item Number 0001 and Item Number 0002 have overlapping dates. Does this mean there is a need for 80 double rooms during those overlapping dates?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can a vendor to bid for some but not all Items such as submitting a bid for Item Number 0002 only?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, vendor can propose some but not all items as long as you propose all rooms in the CLIN.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will there be employee rotation throughout the contract?</p>
<p>Answer: There is a possibility, but it can't be determined at this time.</p>
<p>5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will more than one contract be awarded?</p>
<p>Answer: The Government intends to award one contract, however the Government reserves the right to make multiple awards. See page 60 of the solicitation.</p>
<p>6.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Items Number 1001 and 1002 are marked "option" please explain.</p>
<p>Answer: CLIN 1001 is for an option to continue work from CLIN 0001. CLIN 1002 is for an option to continue work from CLIN 0002. See clause 52.217-9 for further information regarding contract options.</p>
<p>7.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I noticed that you did not specify a star rating in the solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We plan on utilizing XXXX, which is a 2.5 star property that meets specs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Would that property work as long as it meets specs?</p>
<p>Answer: A star rating is not a specification requirement. Proposed properties must meet all specification requirements.</p>
<p>8.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please clarify CLIN #1001 - 300 days 5/1/17-5/31/17</p>
<p>Answer: This was an error. The period should be for 30 days.</p>
<p>9.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I see a few different periods of performance and was wondering if you would consider tiered rates (lower during winter/higher during spring) or if you are looking for a flat rate across the board?</p>
<p>Answer: The offeror shall propose one rate for each CLIN.</p>
<p>10. I found the following language confusing, since it refers to 359 days but specifies a period of performance of roughly 210 days - December 1 - July 1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think that I understand this to have arisen by you adding together an array of options, some of which are mutually exclusive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please advise if this interpretation is correct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Answer: The period of performance of all CLINS spans from 12/1/2016-7/1/2016, which is 212 days; however there are 2 separate groups that will require rooms during the period. CLIN 0001 is 40 rooms for 150 days. The option CLIN 1001 if exercised is 30 days. Total is 180 room days.</p>
<p>CLIN 0002 is 40 rooms for 149 days. The option CLIN 1002 if exercised is 30 days. Total is 179 room days.</p>
<p>11. This requirement is for the long-term lodging rental of 14,360 room days (40 efficiency rooms per day for 359 days total) in the Portsmouth, NH area.&amp;nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Period of Performance is 12/01/2016 through 07/01/2017 to include all Option Periods. &amp; nbsp; This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside and full details can be found in the attached RFQ to include room specifications in Section C.</p>
<p>Can I correctly assume that the item reproduced below contains a typo, since there are not 300 days in the May1 - May 31 window of time?</p>

<p>Answer: Yes, this was a typo. The period should be for 30 days.</p>
<p>12. Will 80 doubles be needed from 1/2/17-4/30/17?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes</p>
<p>13. For this specific solicitation, will the Department of the Navy an offer submitted by a third party vendor ( ie: travel agency / event planner ) on behalf of a hotel/lodging facility?</p>
<p>Answer: As the SF<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>18 states, this is a 100% Small Business set-aside so as long as the travel agency / event planner is a small business, your quote would be considered and evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria posted.</p>
<p>14. If this is a recurrent solicitation; is there information on the incumbent awardee and what would the Naval Sea Command like to see different if it were to award the contract to a different vendor/lodging facility.</p>
<p>Answer: Offerors shall propose properties in accordance with the solicitation specifications. This is not a recurring solicitation.</p>
<p>15. I wanted to check to see if you think it would be beneficial for the Navy to contract with a hotel site selection company like XXX for this. The benefit of this is that it would streamline the process and allow one contract be awarded but the contract holder could work with any hotel in the area and move around based on the lowest price available at the time. If we were to receive complaints, we could easily move to another hotel etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My only concern is that I would not be tax exempt and then the price to the Navy would be more expensive. Do you know of a way I could be tax exempt. If the money was sent directly to the hotel and not to me would that work?</p>
<p>Answer: The contract awardee must be a small business in accordance with the terms of the solicitation. An offeror does not have to be a hotel. The Government will not entertain work arounds to make an offeror tax exempt.</p>
<p>16. If my company was to be awarded this contract, would we be able to award the rooms to any hotel that I find to be technically acceptable or will you be the decision maker as to which hotel will host each group?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am able to find hotels to accommodate all four groups. My goal is to utilize as few hotels as possible, keeping all 40 rooms of each group at one hotel with a maximum of 4 hotels utilized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Answer: Hotels that you propose will be inspected and approved by the Government. There will only be 2 groups. There should be a maximum of 2 hotels</p>
<p>17. In one section of the PWS you state that the hotel must address all the technical requirements. If I am submitting a bid and I will be using multiple hotels, how do I reflect this in my proposal?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Would you like me to submit each hotels technical capabilities and price but use my DUNS#, Cage Code and signature to finalize the forms?</p>
<p>Answer: Submit each hotels technical capabilities and price. The contract would use your DUNS#, Cage Code, and signature.</p>
<p>18. .Will past performance be of XXX or do you want it from each hotel I am partnering with?</p>
<p>Answer: Past performance will be from your company.</p>
<p>19. Are sofa beds considered beds?</p>
<p>Answer: No, there should be 2 double beds.</p>

and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:
  The Government will award to the lowest price, technically acceptable offeror. Brand name or equal. 
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<DESC><p><span style="COLOR: black">The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) F-15 Division, WPAFB, OH intends to issue a solicitation and award a sole source contract to The Boeing Company (Boeing-STL)&nbsp;for a state of the art, long range, integrated Infrared Search and Track (IRST) system.&nbsp; The scope of this effort will include </span>IRST and Operational Flight Program (OFP) integration and test, Low Rate Initial Production, Full Rate Production, management, delivery of spare parts and support equipment, training, systems engineering, technical support, updated technical orders, and will provide Interim Contractor Support (ICS), support organic depot stand-up, and develop and deliver technical data. This IRST effort includes integration of F-15 aircraft-level OFP with one hundred twenty-five (125) IRST production aircraft pods (one hundred (100) to ACC and up to twenty-five (25) additional for ANG) and eight (8) Test Assets. The OFP integration is to ensure the IRST software in the mounted pods operate as designed without compromising any of the existing capabilities of the aircraft.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">After release of the request for proposal (RFP), Boeing-STL will be required to competitively select an IRST pod supplier which will meet the Air Force's IRST requirement. The competitive source selection will secure fixed pricing from the IRST pod supplier throughout integration and test, LRIP and FRP. The IRST pod hardware represents over half of the total contract price, thus providing competitive pricing for a majority of this effort. After an IRST pod supplier has been selected, Boeing-STL will proceed with integration of the selected pod. During this effort, Boeing-STL will begin the preliminary OFP software work, substantiate technical and integration risks, validate Critical Technology Elements (CTEs) and Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), and plan the program baseline through the preliminary design review and critical design review. <span style="COLOR: black">The planned&nbsp;fielding of this IRST system is targeted to be late 2019.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The F-15 Program Office believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Force's requirements. The integration of the mission critical F-15 IRST pods is both complex and highly specialized as it must seamlessly integrate with multiple other mission systems on the aircraft, including but not limited to: APG-63(V)3 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, APG-82(V)1 AESA radar, Advanced Display Core Processor (ADCP) II mission computer upgrade, and the F-15 Aircraft OFP. Boeing-STL is currently the sole integrator managing each of these on-going F-15 modification programs. The F-15 IRST effort must specifically address complex Electromagnetic Interface</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">(EMI), and Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) interoperability. Due to Boeing-STL's position as the sole integrator of all other major F-15 subsystems, they are in the best position to ensure that IRST is interoperable with other F-15 subsystems. Duplication, or transference, of the capabilities possessed by Boeing would be cost and schedule prohibitive. Furthermore, during market research activities conducted for this program, all other vendors responded that they would not be capable of full integration of the IRST pod. All vendors indicated they would require assistance from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Boeing-STL.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">For information on the F-15 IRST requirements, please refer to the Sources Sought Synopsis posted by this office to FedBizOpps on 7 Nov 2014, which can be accessed at: </span></p>

The Air Force does not intend to provide any further information on this requirement. Responsible sources, however, may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Air Force if received within 15 calendar days of the posting of this notice. Any respondent is to specify in its response whether it is a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Respondents should also specify whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. Any responses will be fully evaluated by this office before a final decision is made to negotiate with only one source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."

<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (specifically the Center for Biological Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN)) has a requirement for animal husbandry support services for the (CBER/CDER/CDRH) White Oak Consolidated Animal Program (WOC AP) and (CFSAN) Muirkirk Road Complex (MRC/MOD-1) Animal Care and Use Programs (ACUP). The White Oak Complex is located in Silver Spring, MD and the Muirkirk Road Complex is located in Laurel MD.
<p>The FDA requires animal husbandry support services to both animal research programs including but not limited to the provision of quality care to all research animals, sanitation of all animal care and diet preparation/formulation facilities and the provision of protocol-specified technical procedures support, as well as ancillary tasks necessary to accomplish these services, i.e.: quality control, occupational safety and health, inventory control, equipment maintenance, development and maintenance of standard operating procedures, and a comprehensive training program. The need for these services is paramount as the preponderance of the FDA's research mission can only be accomplished through animal research. Animal-based research projects are highly regulated and demand exemplary execution.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541711- Research and Development in Biotechnology; Small Business Size Standard is 1,000 employees. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal.</p>
<p>The issue date for solicitation number FDA-SOL-1153590 is expected to be released on or about October 17, 2016 with a closing date of the solicitation thirty (30) calendar days after posting. Site visits will be scheduled at each facility on separate days and are expected to occur within the first 8 days of solicitation release. Anticipated contract award date is on or around December 28, 2016. Any resultant contract is expected to be a Labor Hour (LH) contract. It is anticipated that the contract will contain a base year period plus up to four (4) 1-year option periods. It is the contractor's responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for further information relevant to this solicitation. No electronic proposals will be accepted.<br /><br />Services are currently being performed under existing contract number HHSF223201000004I, Task Orders HHSF22301005T and HHSF22301004T.</p>

OSIRIS measures, analyzes, and filters gamma-ray spectral information for on-site inspections under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). OSIRIS software includes a &ldquo;data filter&rdquo; that limits user information to seventeen CTBT-relevant fission product isotopes. Raw spectral data and information on other radioisotopes is not revealed to users, to minimize the potential intrusiveness of the OSIRIS gamma-ray spectroscopy system.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> Unlike other gamma-ray spectral analysis programs, OSIRIS filters the information presented to the user, limiting it to the seventeen CTBT-relevant gamma-ray peaks, calibration isotopes like europium-152, and a few natural background peaks, for example, potassium-40.&nbsp; The natural background peak information is presented to help assure the user of normal spectrometer operation.<br /> <br /> During data acquisition, OSIRIS analyzes the incoming gamma-ray spectrum in real time, using the INL legacy GAUSS Algorithms to search for peaks, divide the spectrum into peak regions, and perform nonlinear least-squares fits of gamma-ray peaks in each region. [3] From the peak fits, OSIRIS calculates the energy and net area of each gamma-ray peak, and, in turn, the emitting radioisotope is determined from the energy and the radioactivity is computed from the net area, for each gamma-ray peak identified in the spectrum.<br /> <br /> OSIRIS controls an ORTEC HPGe gamma-ray spectrometer, including startup, energy and peak-width calibration, data acquisition, and shutdown.&nbsp; The OSIRIS hardware includes an ORTEC Trans-SPEC-DX-100T mechanically-cooled HPGe detector, requiring no liquid nitrogen, and a digital signal-processing multichannel analyzer1. </span></p>

<DESC>This is Modification 4 to the synopsis entitled "Facilities Contract", Solicitation No. NNJ16588264L, which was posted on October 6, 2016. You are notified that an RFI is now posted.
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) is planning to re-compete the Facilities Support Services Contract (FSSC), NNJ08JA02C. This future requirement will constitute the Facilities Contract (FC). This synopsis is a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit comments from industry for acquisition strategies, contract type, streamlining and efficiency achievements, suggestions on bundling of requirements, and for any other technical, business or contractual issues that should be considered by the Government on these future requirements from qualified companies. Industry is invited to provide feedback on the specific areas below. Products and services provided by this contract are required for facility operations and support. <br />The FSSC provides critical support to NASA JSC by providing:</p>
<p>-Facility Maintenance and Repair Services<br />-General Facility Operations and Management<br />-Engineering and Construction Projects<br />-Information Technology Management and Support<br />-Wildlife Management<br />-Environmental Support<br />-Rigging Support</p>
<p>The current FSSC contract is a Cost Plus Award Term/Award Fee (CPAT/AF) contract. The majority of work is covered under the base contract; however, there is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) component for discrete tasks within the general scope of the contract. It is anticipated that the FC will be similar to the current FSSC. The current FC draft Statement of Work (SOW) and other pertinent documents are located at the procurement website: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/fac.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the FSSC is 561210, Facilities Support Services, with a size standard of $38.5 Million. It is anticipated that the NAICS code and size standard will be the same for the FC. "Facilities Support Services" requires the performance of three or more separate activities in the areas of services or specialty trade contractors industries. If services are performed, these service activities must each be in a separate NAICS industry. If the procurement requires the use of specialty trade contractors (plumbing, painting, plastering, carpentry, etc.), all such specialty trade contractors activities are considered a single activity and classified as "Building and Property Specialty Trade Services." Since "Building and Property Specialty Trade Services" is only one activity, two additional activities of separate NAICS industries are required for a procurement to be classified as "Facilities Support Services." The requirements of the FC are not considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product. A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101.</p>
<p>Industry is invited to review the questions listed below and provide feedback on the specific areas requested. The information received will not be released in its submitted form, but may be used in developing the best approach for follow-on strategies, and therefore may be recognizable to the interested party.</p>
<p>1. What changes from the current FSSC contracting approach (contract type, period of performance, etc.), if any, would you suggest for the follow-on FC and why?</p>
<p>2. Provide feedback regarding incentive arrangements. For instance, how should risks versus rewards be shared by the Government and contractor? What types of incentives would you consider to be most effective to encourage the contractor to perform high quality work at a reasonable price?</p>
<p>3. Identify barriers to competition that could be mitigated to foster a more competitive environment for this procurement.</p>
<p>4. Recommend process improvements and efficiencies, both in the acquisition phase and the performance phase, along with identification of non-value-added steps.</p>
<p>5. Discuss ways in which NASA could design/structure this procurement to maximize synergy between the labor skills needed for employees across the contract, and how to best cross-utilize the workforce. Discuss all alternatives you would like NASA to consider.</p>
<p>6. Discuss ways in which NASA could design/structure this procurement to maximize safety, cost control, and system availability while performing maintenance and sustaining engineering on systems.</p>
<p>7. Identify any areas of the FC draft SOW that you believe could be performed by a small business and provide rationale.</p>
<p>8. Identify any areas of the FC draft SOW and/or Data Requirements Descriptions (DRDs) that could be eliminated/modified to reduce the price of the contract.</p>
<p>9. Identify any areas of the FC draft SOW and/or Data Requirements Descriptions (DRDs) that need additional clarification.</p>
<p>10. Contract Transition: Suggest ideas for executing a transition from the current FSSC to the follow-on FC while ensuring continuity of operations. How long should the transition period be?</p>
<p>You are requested to provide electronic responses to the questions above. The total page count is limited to 20 pages for questions 1 through 8 using no less than 12 point Times New Roman font. Please send all responses via e-mail to dominic.j.golemi@nasa.gov. Your response is requested no later than 5:00 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST) on October 28, 2016.</p>
<p>The Government intends to review the responses submitted, but will not respond to individual submissions. NASA reserves the right to share all information received in response to this RFI with any NASA civil servants, and to use all information submitted in response to this RFI in developing a future acquisition strategy. This data will not be shared outside the Government nor released in its submitted form. Confidential, proprietary, competition sensitive, or business information should not be submitted in response to this RFI. Such information will not be reviewed and will be deleted. Any communications in reference to this RFI shall cite the RFI number in the subject line and be directed to the point of contact identified above.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. The Government will not pay for any information solicited. No evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.</p>

<DESC>**MODIFICATION TO UPLOAD BOA ATTACHMENT ONLY**  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW) is establishing a Southern California and Arizona 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA). NAVFAC SW is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) Developmental Stage (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, CA; and Phoenix, AZ) to participate in this BOA program. The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs. The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c). The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts. The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between NAVFAC SW and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract. In accordance with DFARS Clause 252.219-7009 the 8(a) firm shall not subcontract the performance of any of the requirements of the contract without the prior written approval of the SBA and the Contracting Officer. Additionally FAR Clause 52.219-14 defines the limitations on subcontracting should approval to subcontract be obtained. Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed. If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government, upon SBA concurrence, reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts. Only the following designated NAICS codes pertain to this BOA: 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction; 237110 Water, Sewer Line  and  Related Structures Construction; 237120 Oil, Gas Pipeline  and  Related Structures Construction; 237130 Power, Communication Line  and  Related Structures Construction; 237310 Highway, Street  and  Bridge Construction; 238160 Roofing; 238210 Electrical Contractors  and  Other Wiring Installation; 238220 Plumbing, Heating  and  Air-Conditioning; 238320 Painting  and  Wall Covering; 238330 Flooring; 238910 Site Preparation Contractors; 238990 All Other Specialty Trade Contractors. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). Types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items). However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be under the NAICS Subsector 238. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $4,000,000 per firm. Individual task orders will range between $2,001 and $1,000,000. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $30,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each order. Task orders will not be advertised. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA. Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible. To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) Developmental Stage participant prior to the submission deadline indicated below and still be certified as an 8(a) Developmental Stage participant at the time of award (planned award date is October 6, 2016); have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, CA; and Phoenix, AZ Districts); (2) Be registered in the System for Award Management database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/; the SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; and VETS-4212 at http://www.dol.gov/vets/vets4212.htm (if not applicable, provide a statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,001 - $1,000,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under one of the following designated NAICS codes: 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction; 237110 Water, Sewer Line  and  Related Structures Construction; 237120 Oil, Gas Pipeline  and  Related Structures Construction; 237130 Power, Communication Line  and  Related Structures Construction; 237310 Highway, Street  and  Bridge Construction; 238160 Roofing; 238210 Electrical Contractors  and  Other Wiring Installation; 238220 Plumbing, Heating  and  Air-Conditioning; 238320 Painting  and  Wall Covering; 238330 Flooring; 238910 Site Preparation Contractors; 238990 All Other Specialty Trade Contractors within the last three years.

<DESC>[NOTE FOR CONTRACT SPECIALIST (Do Not Post this Note): Issue J&amp;A as Brand Name Notice of Intent as a "SPECIAL NOTICE" or SOURCE SOUGHT AMENDMENT to "W911KB-16-S-192A"]
<p>TITLE: NOTICE OF INTENT TO INCLUDE BRAND NAME COMPONENTS IN A FUTURE CONSTRUCTION REPAIR CONTRACT UNDER NAICS 238210, FTG, AK</p>
<p>SUBJECT: THIS NOTICE IS MARKET RESEARCH TO SUPPORT INTENT TO INCLUDE BRAND NAME SOLE SOURCE SPECIFICATION IN AN FY17 CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, TITLED, FTG192 IDT SWITCHGEAR BOX FACILITY, FORT GREELY, ALASKA. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. Provisions set forth by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) &sect; 6.302-1(c)(1) authorizes the use of brand name only supplies as part of an acquisition when supplies may be deemed to be available only from one or a limited number of sources, and when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. As such, for the purposes described hereunder and in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, coupled with the Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District intends to issue a competitive solicitation that will include brand name only specification items. Specifically, the contractor awarded the competitive construction contract will be required to purchase the following brand name Critical Systems in support of the planned construction renovation acquisition:</p>
<p>a) Low-voltage circuit breakers for an EATON Type FDE with adjustable LSIG, EATON Type KD Optim Trip, and Siemens Type JC with 576 LSI Trip Units</p>
<p>b) GE RX3i PLC; Power Control and Monitoring System (PCMS) network utilizes the GE RX3i and all individual building power components are required to communicate and integrate with the PCMS system and head-end.</p>
<p>c) Hirschmann Mach 1000/RS-20 network switch; Power Control and Monitoring System (PCMS) network switch is a Hirschmann Mach 1000/RS-20 network switch and all individual building power components are required to communicate and integrate with the PCMS head end.</p>
<p>d) SEL specification for a SEL-751A and SEL-411L relays; site-wide electrical coordination system and Power Control and Monitoring System (PCMS) network is currently configured to operate with SEL relays and all individual building power components are required to communicate and integrate with the PCMS network and head end.<br /><br />e) Alerton VLX Controller; Site Control and Monitoring System (SCMS) controller is an Alerton VLX Controller and all individual building components are required to communicate and integrate with the SCMS head end.</p>
<p>f) Cisco ME-3600X-24FS-M/IE-3000-8TC network switch; Site Control and Monitoring System (SCMS) NETWORK Switch is a Cisco ME-3600X-24FS-M and all individual building components are required to communicate and integrate with the SCMS head end.</p>
<p>g) APC specification for a Symmetra LX UPS designed for business-critical applications in server rooms and network closets.</p>
<p>h) Edwards EST-3 Fire and life safety system; Site-wide Fire Alarm and Life Safety Systems is an Edwards System and all individual building fire and life safety systems are required to communicate and integrate with the Edwards System head end.<br /><br />The use of the original manufacturer of materials and components is required to prevent issues of system functionality and extensive additional costs. The use of any other manufacturer would cause a need to replace in essence complete parts and accessories thus creating complete new systems. Therefore, the future contract will need to use brand name descriptions peculiar to one manufacturer for a specific system with whom a turn-key solution can be provided meeting all government requirements.<br />The government has already developed plans and specifications for the planned construction acquisition, and intends to utilize full and open competitive procedures for the future solicitation/contract of the construction project requiring the brand name only components. The future solicitation will be numbered as W911KB-17-R-0019. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the project is 238210 with a small business size in dollars of $15M.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and submit clearly articulated product information, vendor/distributor information. Product information lacking the particular features that do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, this agency's needs cannot be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice of intent to include brand name component within the construction acquisition is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to include a statement of brand name or equal for the planned future competitive construction procurement.</p>
<p>Vendors who offer the above items which can meet all of the above functional criteria are invited to respond to this notice. Responses must include the following information:<br />(1) Identification of the manufacturer's name, address, and country of product manufacture.<br />(2) Fully detailed specification sheets.<br />(3) Narrative addressing how your product meets the salient features listed above.</p>
<p>Interested firms may submit their interest and information from the date of this notice until 2:00 PM Alaska Time on 21 OCTOBER 2016 via email to POC noted below. Any electronically submitted files by Email CANNOT EXCEED this Agency's size limit of 10MB (includes email and its attachment); files exceeding this size will be denied access to our email inbox. It is the responsibility of your firm to determine the size of its electronic file. The posting of this Notice satisfies the provisions set forth at FAR Subpart 5.2 for notice of intent to include brand name specifications in planned construction acquisition. The Point of Contact for this Notice is Julie McLaughlin. Send responses to U. S. Army Engineer District, Alaska, ATTN: CEPOA-CT (McLaughlin), <br />P. O.

The intent is to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for emergency response to actual or impending levee breaches/failures and resultant flooding events. Public Law 84-99 authorizes the Corps of Engineers to provide both technical and direct support in response to flood control and coastal emergencies. By its nature, this authorization covers no-notice events and mission critical requirements that cannot be met through a normal acquisition process and schedule. This acquisition will provide the contractual vehicle to meet the Sacramento District's mission responsibilities for direct support during a declared emergency.
<p>The contract resulting from this acquisition will replace an IDIQ Requirements SATOC for emergency levee repairs, which expired 5 April 2013. This contract will have a 3-year base period and one 2-year option period with a total maximum contract capacity not to exceed $47M. The minimum ordering limit will be $3K and the maximum-ordering limit will be $47M. The minimum guarantee will be $3K. Being that we do not know the size of the emergency, it is important that we have the maximum flexibility in ordering what we need, when we need it. This Procurement will be conducted under PSC Code: Z1PC and NAICS Code: 237990, Maintenance of Unimproved real property (land) . The size standard for this NAICS code is $36,500,000.</p>
<p>The Government will select the offer that represents the best value to the Government by using the trade-off process described in FAR Part 15. This process permits tradeoffs between price and technical ("non-price") factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced offer. The award decision will be based on a comparative analysis and an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about 8 Apr 2016.</p>
<p>The site visit/pre-proposal conference date, time and location will be identified in the solicitation.<br />OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELLED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS.</p>

The intent is to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for emergency response to actual or impending levee breaches/failures and resultant flooding events. Public Law 84-99 authorizes the Corps of Engineers to provide both technical and direct support in response to flood control and coastal emergencies. By its nature, this authorization covers no-notice events and mission critical requirements that cannot be met through a normal acquisition process and schedule. This acquisition will provide the contractual vehicle to meet the Sacramento District's mission responsibilities for direct support during a declared emergency.
<p>The contract resulting from this acquisition will replace an IDIQ Requirements SATOC for emergency levee repairs, which expired 5 April 2013. This contract will have a 3-year base period and one 2-year option period with a total maximum contract capacity not to exceed $47M. The minimum ordering limit will be $3K and the maximum-ordering limit will be $47M. The minimum guarantee will be $3K. Being that we do not know the size of the emergency, it is important that we have the maximum flexibility in ordering what we need, when we need it. This Procurement will be conducted under PSC Code: Z1PC and NAICS Code: 237990, Maintenance of Unimproved real property (land) . The size standard for this NAICS code is $36,500,000.</p>
<p>The Government will select the offer that represents the best value to the Government by using the trade-off process described in FAR Part 15. This process permits tradeoffs between price and technical ("non-price") factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced offer. The award decision will be based on a comparative analysis and an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about 8 Apr 2016.</p>
<p>The site visit/pre-proposal conference date, time and location will be identified in the solicitation.<br />OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELLED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS.</p>

<DESC>The existing 200 ton crane at NSA Mechanicsburg at building 411 will be removed and replaced with a new 200 ton crane that will serve building 411 in addition to building 412.

This project will install new structural supports (replace 6 existing and construct 4) for this new crane and provide structural repairs and modification to building 411. It will also make the necessary building modification to building 412 so this crane can serve both buildings.

The 200 Ton crane support structure will be located at the centerline of Bay 15 of Buildings 411 and 412. New coiling doors will be provided in both buildings to maximize the opening for equipment to be moved in Bay 15 without demolition of exterior building columns.
 Extending from the coiling doors from each building will be loading platforms.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval (J&A) For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:
Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 20.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:
This procurement is for the Boise VA Medical Center under PR# 531-16-3-9961-0086. They have a requirement that will be filled using a Firm-Fixed Price contract.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:
This is a request for Wireless Vital Sign Monitors; Total estimated value for this procurement is
$204,442.00. The customer has provided a suggested vendor for this product: Phillips.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:
Title 38 U.S.C. 8127 (b), (c) and (d) provide the authority for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Contracting Officers (COs) to make awards to service-disabled Veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) and Veteran-owned small business (VOSB) firms using other than full and open competition when certain conditions are met. In addition, VAAR 819.7007(b) allows the CO to award to an SDVOSB on a sole source basis:

(  ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
(  ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
(  ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
(  ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
(X) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5; (  ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
(  ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
Title 38 U.S.C. 8127 (b), (c) and (d) provide the authority for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Contracting Officers (COs) to make awards to service-disabled Veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) and Veteran-owned small business (VOSB) firms using other than full and open competition when certain conditions are met.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:
A search on GSA, under 65IIA/ A-50A Vital Sign Monitors did not come up with any SDVOSB/VOSB that can provide the product being requested. I then contacted the manufacturer, and they provided an SDVOSB Certified Distributer that can provide the products needed. Therefore, per VAAR 819.7007(4)(b), this can be sole sourced to the lone SDVOSB. "The contracting officer's determination whether to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer. A determination that only one SDVOSB concern is available to meet the requirement is not required."
 
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:
IAW VAAR 819.7007(4), when making a sole source award the pricing must be made at a fair and reasonable price. IAW FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(vii), The pricing provided by Four Points is  considered to be fair and reasonable based on any other reasonable basis. In this case, there were  similar Vital Sign Monitors on GSA contract, priced similarly; however, these monitors did not match the customers exact salient characteristics. An example would be the Surveyor S19 Patient Monitor, which is priced, on contract, at $7,968.34 each. All other line items were priced similarly as well.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:
As required by FAR Part 10, market research was conducted to look at all SDVOSB/VOSB opportunities on schedule, but with no vendors able to provide this type of equipment this award will be  made to a SDVOSB through open market.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:
None.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:
None.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:
No actions were taken to overcome barriers. There are many vendors who can supply Vital Sign Monitors, but I am looking to SDVOSBs first and found one that could provide. They are also an authorized distributor for the manufacturer.

12.	Approvals in accordance with the VHAPM, Volume 6, Chapter VI: OFOC SOP.

Contracting Officer's Certification (required): I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: The authority for applying the Commercial Test Program of  FAR 13.5 is (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) and is implemented by restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2). This justification is in accordance with FAR 6.001(a), acquisitions conducted under FAR 13 for SAP are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2. The specific reasons for restricting competition is the proprietary nature of this procurement, and exclusive licensing agreements for St. Jude Medical Inc.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  The contractor, St. Jude Medical Inc., is the manufacturer and sole distributor of the required electrodes. Furthermore, these parts will be used with the existing EnSite Velocity System owned by the VA which is also manufactured by St. Jude Medical Inc.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10): FAR Part I 0 directs that market research be conducted on each acquisition appropriate to the circumstances. Market research was conducted for this procurement and mandatory sources were queried in order of priority (see briefcase). Market research revealed that St. Jude Medical Inc. is proprietary to their equipment, and that no other vendor can meet this requirement because of its characteristics.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition: Market research has revealed there is only one responsible source for this procurement due to its "brand name" requirements.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: No additional sources expressed interest in this acquisition because of its requirements.

11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions  for the Supplies or Services Required: None

Thermo Scientific confirmed that the only authorized distributor is a VOSB and there are no other small business distributors (documentation on file). 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  GSS, Inc. discounted open market price of $238,892.00 for equipment is $24,686.84 less than GSA listed price of $263,578.84 which has already been determined fair and reasonable by GSA.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY
   
1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Acquisition Operations
      Technology Acquisition Center
      23 Christopher Way
      Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

2.	Description of Action: This proposed action is for a firm-fixed price delivery order to be issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for brand name Gigamon hardware maintenance.
 
3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  The Office of Information and Technology, Service Delivery and Engineering, Enterprise Operations (EO) has a requirement for brand name Gigamon hardware maintenance for existing Gigamon network devices.  The Gigamon hardware maintenance will consist of hardware maintenance to repair or replace systems equipment components that restores full operation and accessibility to the original redundant component configuration.  The hardware maintenance services will consist of 24 hours a day x 7 days a week x 365/366 days per year, initial response to all requests for maintenance within one hour of the initial notification from VA, and respond to all requests for on-site maintenance service by sending a technician/engineer to the affected site within four hours of the initial notification from VA.  The hardware maintenance is necessary for EO to operate successfully and ensure the hardware remains operational.  The period of performance is October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017 with four 12-month option periods.     

4.	Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C 4106(c)(2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled, "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."

5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited:  Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it was determined that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for the brand name Gigamon hardware maintenance.  The current EO infrastructure uses existing Gigamon hardware and VA requires support compatible with the existing infrastructure protocols and functionality for continued operational availability.  VA requires   hardware upgrades and updates to include major releases, point releases, service releases of applicable hardware on a quarterly basis, or within 48 hours in cases where a high risk vulnerability fix becomes available.  The hardware updates are required for Gigamon "Network Switch GIGAVUE-2404", and Gigamon "Network monitoring devices".  Only Gigamon, through an authorized reseller, can provide the necessary hardware maintenance because of the proprietary source code required to develop and implement hardware updates.  No other source is capable of providing the required hardware maintenance that meets VA's functional requirements due to these proprietary constraints.  In addition, a prior implementation of Gigamon hardware already exists in EO.  No other maintenance is compatible with or interoperable with the existing Gigamon hardware.  

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in section 8 of this document.  Although the Government is limiting competition as a result of specifying a brand name, there are multiple authorized resellers of the brand name hardware maintenance on the NASA SEWP V GWAC.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2), this action will be synopsized at award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page and the justification will be made publicly available.    
 
7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the Government will continue to review other maintenance providers and conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to further be competed.  

8.	Market Research:  The Government's technical experts conducted market research in May 2016 by reviewing maintenance providers for similar hardware products to ascertain if other vendors could meet VA's requirements.  Specifically, the Government's technical experts conducted web-based research and reviewed CommView and Solar Winds Netflow, both of which manufacture and provide support for network analyzers.  As a result of the market research, the technical experts confirmed that each hardware manufacturer produces and supports its own hardware with proprietary source code and protocols, and does not provide maintenance for other brand hardware.  The source code required to issue the hardware updates is proprietary to Gigamon and not available to other hardware maintenance providers.  No other source has the capability of developing and issuing hardware maintenance coverage for Gigamon hardware necessary to support existing EO requirements.  All of the products researched such as CommView and Solar Winds Netflow network analyzers were unable to meet the functional requirements as stated in paragraph 5.  Based on the above, only Gigamon hardware maintenance meets all of the Government's requirements.

FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for limited competition for a firm-fixed-price delivery order to be issued under the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for Liferay Portal Enterprise Edition (EE) software licenses, software maintenance, and technical support.  

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA), Veterans and Consumer Health Informatics Office (V/CHIO), has a requirement for the renewal of 14 Liferay software licenses, purchase of an additional 7 licenses, as well as maintenance and technical support for all licenses.  The Liferay portal EE software licenses are currently being utilized as the user interface of the MyHealtheVet platform, however based upon increased demands, renewal of the current licenses and additional licenses are required.  With the entire MHV web based portal running on Liferay, it is critical that the Office of Information and Technology Enterprise Program Management Office (EPMO), MHV Product Development (PD) teams have access to technical support necessary to support the system.  The procurement of Liferay Portal licenses, maintenance, and technical support will allow non-technical VHA staff to continue to manage website content updates without intervention from the EPMO PD staff.  Additionally, the software maintenance will provide bug fixes and updates that are required to keep the software operational to mitigate security vulnerabilities.  The period of performance for the software license, technical and product support is 12 months with one 12 month option period.    
                        
4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Paragraph 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized." 

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based on market research, as described in section 8 of this document, it has been determined that limited competition for Liferay Portal EE software and maintenance is viable among authorized resellers or these products. The current MHV platform utilizes Liferay portal EE software licenses for its user interface.  This user interface integrates with the currently fielded MHV platform, which has 26 distinct applications, such as Appointments, Pharmacy, Blue Button, and the Healthy Living Assessment.  Liferay Portal EE has been integrated with each of these MHV capabilities.  If any other brand name software was to be utilized as the user interface for the MHV platform, then all 26 capabilities would require integration with the new software.  All of the current applications are coded to specifically interact with Liferay EE Portal source code.  Any integration of a different software solution would result in the inability to access MHV for at least 1.5 years.  This would severely impact 3.1 million Veterans as MHV is the Veteran's sole resource for virtual healthcare from VA.  Veterans would lose the ability to virtually access their personal health information, virtually contact their physicians, access thier appointment information, and virtually refill vital medications, among all the other capabilities that MHV currently provides.   This delay estimate is based upon previous efforts for similar integration work.
 
Additionally, since Liferay software is proprietary, no other vendor can provide the required software maintenance and technical support.  In order to continue to correct bugs or remediate security vulnerabilities in the software, access to the source code is required.  No other vendor, other than the software developer, has access to this source code.  Furthermore, for this reason, no other vendors offer technical support for the product that VA can utilize to allow non-technical VHA staff to continue to manage website content updates without intervention from the EPMO PD staff.  Other software developers that offer similar products merely provide software maintenance and technical support for its own proprietary software product.      

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:   Market research was conducted, details of which are in section 8 of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  It was determined however that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for brand name Liferay software licenses and technical support.  In accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A)(2), this justification will be provided with the solicitation to all interested NASA SEWP V GWAC holders.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), notice of award of the resulting order will be synopsized and this justification will be made publicly available within 14 days after award on the Federal Business Opportunity website.

 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions of this requirement, the Government's technical experts will continue to perform market research to determine if there are any suites of products available that will enable future requirements when competed.

8.  Market Research:  Market research was last conducted in January 2016 by the Government's technical experts.  The team searched the following content management products:  Alfresco, Drupal 8.0, and Team site, and Liferay Portal Enterprise Edition.  The Government's technical experts determined that none of the other products will meet the Government's requirements as outlined in section 5 of this justification.  While these software developers provide products that perform similar functions, selecting an alternate product would require a significant redesign to the MHV portal.  Additionally, these vendors only offer software maintenance and technical support for its own proprietary product.  Market research has concluded that Liferay Portal Enterprise Edition is the only software product that meets all of the needs of the Government.  

Additional market research was conducted in January 2016 by utilizing the NASA SEWP V GWAC Provider Look-up Tool to determine whether the brand name Liferay Portal EE software licenses and technical support is available from resellers that hold NASA SEWP V contracts.  It was determined that there are several resellers of brand name Liferay Portal EE software licenses and technical support that hold current NASA SEWP V contracts.

JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier. This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3). Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.
1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: VA256-16-AP- 11410	1A. PROJECT/TASK
No.	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT:
$10,820.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:
Courier service for Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) affiliated with Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS) located in Russellville, AR, Searcy, AR, Conway, AR, El Dorado, AR, Mena, AR, Hot Springs, AR, Pine Bluff, AR, Mt. Home, AR, and delivery of supplies to the same CBOCs.
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED: This is a temporary contract to allow sufficient time to solicit for a base year and four option years of courier services. Due to delays in receiving a technical and legal review of the solicitation, this temporary contract is necessary to maintain patient care. The vendor has performed these services in the past. Xpress Courier Service, Inc. has acceptable past performance.
4. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED: Due to the short time to award this contract, little market research was attempted. There are no other local vendors in this area capable of performing this service on short notice.  More thorough market research has been accomplished for the base + four pending solicitation.
5. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
