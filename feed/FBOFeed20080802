<DESC>This synopsis is a re-issuance of NCI-80158-NG from August 1, 2008.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Molecular Imaging Section of Radiation Oncology Branch (MISROB), Mammary Biology and Tumorigenesis Laboratory (MBTL) plans to procure on a sole source basis the IGG100 Gallium-68 Generator with Eckert & Zeigler Eurotope; Robert-Rossle-Str 10; Berlin 13125 DEU.
 
This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 334510 the business size standard is 500 employees.  
 
The Molecular Imaging Section of Radiation Oncology Branch, CCR, improves the efficiency of radiotherapy by combining gradiation with optimized targeted therapy and adjustment of the treatment to individual patients using non-invasive methods of tumor characterization. The goal of the NCI is to utilize multidisciplinary approach engaging systems biology, molecular imaging, and nanotechnology to develop individualized approach to treatment of breast cancer involving assessment of target presence and distribution in an individual patient followed by optimized, target-specific drug delivery.
 
The Eckert & Zeigler IGG100 Gallium-68 Generator is designed to minimize both Gb68 breakthrough and metal impurities. The IGG100 Gallium-68 Generator is shipped in a ready-to-use condition with both the inlet and outlet lines using Luer female connections with attached caps that facilitate easy installation to the Mammary Biology and Tumorigenesis Laboratory (MBTL). Eckert & Ziegler Eurotope GmbH has developed a validated 68Ga peptide synthesis process. 
 
The following salient characteristics apply to the IGG100 Gallium-68 Generator:
 
1.	The metallic cation 68Ga(III) readily forms stable complexes with DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) modified Affibody molecules and positron emitter, 
2.	Allows peptides and other small molecules to be radiolabled at high specific activities, 
3.	68Ga has a positron yield as high as 89% of all disintegrations, 
4.	Half-life of 68 minutes is compatible with the pharmacokinetics of peptides of interest in diagnostic imaging and therapy, 
5.	271 day half-life of the parent, 
6.	68Ge isotope allows the use of the 68Ge/68Ga generator for up to one year without access to a cyclotron, and 
7.	IGG100 Gallium-68 Generator offers low breakthrough and light weight. 
 
PART II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition
 
Statute: This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).
            
            (b) Soliciting from a single source
 
(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).
 
No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.
 
Eckert & Zeigler is the only known company that manufactures a 68Ga generator for the U.S. market.  The major advantage of the IGG100 model is a significantly lower Ge-68 breakthrough, at about a factor of 10.  This is important because Ge-68 has a long half-life, about 270 days, so it would persist in the organism being studied which is necessary for the clinical studies being performed by the Mammary Biology and Tumorigenesis Laboratory (MBTL) in the Molecular Imaging Section of Radiation Oncology Branch (MISROB). There is no other source known to the NCI that can complete this requirement. 
 
This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 am EDT, on August 18, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and must be emailed to Malinda Holdcraft at holdcram@mail.nih.gov faxed to (301) 402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov    In addition; contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference NCI-80158-NG-01 on all correspondence

The Mosaic photobleaching accessory for the Nikon Ti Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscope will enable more efficient performance that is dependent on observation of dynamic microscopic structures in live cells. NCI needs to analyze the dynamic behavior of intracellular organelles and proteins labeled with fluorescence probes including genetic tags like the green fluorescent protein (GFP). To follow particular cohorts of dynamic structures NCI needs to either photobleach or photoactivate arbitrary areas (any shape) in living cells while observing them with the Nikon Ti TIRF microscope. For our studies NCI needs to perform the photobleaching rapidly at any time during an imaging experiment. Addition of photobleaching capabilities to the system is crucial for several scientific projects currently under investigation by the group including following the fate of T cell receptor subunits in T cell- B cell conjugates, monitoring the movement of vesicles in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, observing the biogenisis and stability of adhesive structures as well as photoactivation and photoconversion of clustered molecules in activated Jurkat T cells.              
 
PART II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition
 
Statute: This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).
            
            (b) Soliciting from a single source
 
(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).
 
No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.
 
The photobleaching accessory we acquire must be compatible with the Nikon Ti microscope that we are purchasing for TIRF imaging. Because the photobleaching unit much be coordinated with the TIRF imaging system and must be controlled with the Nikon software that operates the instrument, only a photobleaching accessory from Photonic Instruments, which can be controlled by the Nikon Elements software, can be used.  There is no other known manufacturer to the NCI other than Photonic Instruments Inc. that can provide the equipment required to accomplish the above. 
 
The following salient characteristics apply to the Photonic with TIRF optics: 
-  Photobleaching accessory must fit onto and work through the Nikon Ti microscope with TIRF optics,
- Photobleaching accessory must be controlled by the Elements Nikon software including defining areas and analyzing bleach patterns,
- Photobleaching must be available as arbitrary Regions of Interest (ROI’s),
- Multiple bleaching areas must be available in a single field of view,
- Must include solid state diode laser and all needed optical elements to introduce bleaching

<DESC>This synopsis replaces NCI-80147-MM originally issued on July 30, 2008.


The National Cancer Institute (NCI), plans to enter into a sole source procurement for the analysis of p53 mutations of approximately 200 DNA samples extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block samples for the Risk Factors for Bladder Cancer in the New England Study of Environmental Health with Transgenomics Discovery Services, 12325 Emmet Street; Omaha NE 68164.
 
The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $12M. 
 
The National Cancer Institute conducted a case-control study of bladder cancer among men and women in New England (02212). The purpose of the New England Study of Environment and Health (NESEH), is to investigate a number of environmental, occupational, and personal risk factors for bladder cancer.  The NCI enrolled patients with bladder cancer who were identified in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, between 2001 and 2004.  Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks were sectioned onto slides in preparation for microdissection and DNA extraction from each subject with an incident diagnosis of bladder cancer who provided consent for the collection of tissue and medical records.  We are now planning to pilot test using DNA extracted from these cases for PCR-based molecular analyses from a subset of cases to determine if the quality and quantity of DNA is suitable for mutational spectrum and epigenetic assays.   
 
Contractor Requirements:
 
1.	DNA shall be isolated and quantitative PCR measurements analyzed using three 5-micron tissue sections on slides that were sectioned from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks that have been microdissected and placed in 1.5ml tubes. 
2.	DNA shall be quantitated using quantitative PCR technology and the amount of non-degraded, PCR amplifiable DNA will be measured and reported. 
3.	Mutation screening of exons 5-8 of the p53 gene shall be screened using Surveyor endonuclease. Digests by capillary electrophoresis, double stranded sequencing, and sequence analysis shall be conducted and analyzed by the contractor. 
4.	For mutant samples, the specific exon, codon, and type of mutation (amino acid change, deletion, and insertion) shall be reported in an electronic format using MS Excel.  Samples without mutations shall be reported as not having mutations. The reports shall be provided three months after receipt of samples.  
5.	 All chromatograms and sequencing traces shall be included as electronic files with all reports. 
6.	If samples fail to sequence, re-amplification at no additional charge to the government shall be completed at least two times if sufficient DNA is available or can be provided. 
7.	Milestone and/or phasing charts illustrate a logical sequence of proposed events.  These shall be provided at the beginning of the study.  
 
Period of performance shall be 12 months from date of award.
              
Transgenomics is the only source known to the NCI that is currently the only company to provide this specific type of high-throughput, and sensitive sequencing services utilizing Surveyor endonuclease, an optimized derivative of Cel I endonuclease and the patented WAVE® system to separate fragments based upon size. Transgenomic, Inc. is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because they are the only laboratory that analyzes promoter hypermethylation using bisulfite treated DNA and sequence analysis.  Additionally, Transgenomic previously performed VHL mutational spectrum analysis and a pilot study of VHL promoter hypermethylation for the Central and Eastern European RCC study with high throughput that will allow for comparability of the results from these analyses to the previous study.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB) Community Oncology and Prevention Trials Research Group (COPTRG) plans to procure on a sole source basis, Clinical BRCA1 and BRCA2 Germline Mutation Testing with Myriad Genetics Laboratories, Inc., 320 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, UT 84108-9930.

The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.5.
The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541720 the business size standard is $7.0M employees.

The contractor shall provide CLIA-certified germline mutation testing for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes. This clinical testing will be provided to a subset of women who have previously enrolled in the National Ovarian Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Study, also known as Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol 199 (“GOG-199”).  This study is now closed to new patient enrollment; 5 years’ prospective follow-up is underway, and will be complete in November 2011.         
      
The contractor will provide clinically-based germline mutation testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in a manner that is consistent with current clinical practice standards for a maximum of 1,405 participants: 

The period of performance is for one year with two one-year options and one 5-month option.  This contract will be awarded as an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with established minimum and maximum quantities.

Myriad Genetics owns the patents on both the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes, and is the only known source to the NCI available to perform the required work.  The assay procedure employed to identify germline mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes is difficult and complex. It is essential to the ongoing scientific integrity and validity of the research studies being supported to obtain future data in a manner which will permit reliable comparison with assay results already obtained from GOG-199 subjects who have been tested clinically prior to enrollment in the study. Failure to do so could invalidate the cornerstone of these important research projects, i.e., the accurate, timely and reliable classification of study participants with regard to their BRCA1/2 germline mutation status.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to enter into a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition  Procedures with    Marshall & Swift/ Boeckh, 915 Wilshire Boulevard, 8th Floor, Los Angeles, California 90017 to Producer Price Index needs, services, and data to aid in estimating an output price Index for New School Building  Construction.  These services and data are not available from public sector sources. 
 Total cost  for this requirement  NTE  $22,932.88.








Marshall & Swift/Boeckh is a leading supplier of construction cost information.  It provides accurate and up-to-date cost information for construction projects throughout the United States.  Marshall & Swift/Boeckh provides construction sector data to thousands of customers, including numerous government agencies.  It has been in business for several decades and it continues to expand the scope and quality of its products and services.   Under a contract awarded in FY2002, Marshall & Swift/Boeckh has provided BLS very similar data to that covered under this Statement of Work.  This purchase was awarded through an open bidding process, and Marshall & Swift/Boeckh was the lowest cost provider from among a very limited pool of qualified vendors.  BLS has found the data provided under this contract to be acceptable and the vendor to be attentive to the Bureau’s needs.  Building on this past relationship, Marshall & Swift/Boeckh is best positioned to fulfill the terms of this purchase with minimal difficulty.  The traditional ‘start-up’ costs have been incurred, and the work to fulfill this contract can begin with the company having a superior knowledge of the larger project, methodologies, and common nomenclature.  Other firms would face significant ‘start-up’ research and development costs and would not be able to provide BLS with the data required under this Statement of Work at the price quoted by Marshall & Swift/Boeckh.  For these reasons, Marshall & Swift/Boeckh is the appropriate vendor for this purchase.  These data are necessary for BLS to continue calculating the New School Building Construction PPI.

The suggested contractor is Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.<BR>CLIN # 0001 THRU 0004:   The Harmonic Scalpel is an ultrasonic precision cutting/coagulating instrument that is used by multiple services. These services frequently operate on the same day and have to compete for use of the device. The harmonic scalpel causes less thermal tissue damage than the regular electrosurgical devices, minimal charring and desiccation of tissue, speeds surgery time due to reduced needed for ligature of vessels, and no electricity is passed through the patient. This device is essential to provide the standard of care our patients expect. The components are not interchangeable with any other different brand of equipment. The Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc is the only vendor that can provide this technology and meets these requirements. <BR>This is not a request for proposal.  However, companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include technical specifications of their product, past performance information, price and delivery time.  This information will be reviewed by the Government technical representatives for consideration for future requirements.  <BR>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service for the following services:&nbsp;The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS or NOAA-Fisheries), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC) is a government agency charged with the mission of stewardship of living marine resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Background and Objectives: The Center provides scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise-use of the Northwest region's marine and anadromous resources. The Conservation Biology Division provides technical support and conducts research related to the conservation of marine organisms, including Pacific salmon.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to collect genotypic data at a set of microsatellite (mSAT), intron loci, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in collections of steelhead/rainbow trout (O. mykiss) and conduct relevant statistical analyses relevant to the goals of the Dam Recolonization Team. Prior to dam removal at several Columbia River and Puget Sound locations, neutral genetic markers and phenotypic data are being collected to assess the levels of divergence of above-dam populations (residents) and downstream anadromous populations. These data will be used to assess the phylogenetic relationships of the two life history forms and the role of resident fish in the recolonization of anadromous fish (steelhead) into the upstream habitat. Missing in this data set is a complimentary and independent set of DNA markers that directly identify species. Resident mykiss encounter ecologically and genetically coastal cutthroat trout (O. clarki); their genetic interaction alters our assessment of genetic distinctiveness and gene flow among geographic gene pools of steelhead/rainbow trout.<br /><br />Survey data of introns, along with neutral genetic markers and morphological phenotypes, will address questions of hybridization, remixing of life history types, hatchery introgression, and monitoring reproductive success of recolonization. Recovery planning decisions in the Columbia River watershed, as well as in the Puget Sound basin, may differ if resident-anadromous forms are a panmictic plastic polymorphism versus genetically distinct, adaptive groups. Collecting genotypic data for introns developed specifically for species identification is crucial to help make that distinction.<br /><br />SNP loci are evolutionarily-neutral genetic markers that less subjective to score and are more amenable to high throughput laboratory procedures. The development of SNP loci as indicators of population genetic dynamics is laborious, and for salmonids, in its developmental infancy. The salmon genetics community is striving to develop and implement these markers for conservation and management use coastwide.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this project is to collect genotypic data for 15 mSATs and 2-4 intron markers (when necessary) from NWFSC collections and compare resident and anadromous populations within and between watersheds. Moreover, a secondary objective is to develop SNP loci for routine population genetic surveys and compare with mSAT evaluations. Collections will originate from four Columbia River sites (White Salmon River, Lewis River, Little Sandy, and Icicle Creek) and two Puget Sound sites (Elwha and Green rivers).</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>Task 1. <br />CONTRACTOR will assemble and catalog isolated DNA from collections provided by the point of contact. This Task will be accomplished on the Mukilteo campus and coordinated with the Point of Contact.</p>
<p>Task 2. <br />CONTRACTOR will use standard and proven molecular techniques to resolve genotypes for DNA markers. DNA markers to be studied are 15 mSAT loci currently being used by NWFSC Conservation Biology program, 2-4 intron markers developed by Contractor that discriminate between mykiss and clarki, and 5 to 25 new SNP loci to be identified and developed. Reruns will be used to try to resolve difficult individuals and/or technical mistakes. Up to 300 fish from the five sample sites will be analyzed for a total not to exceed 1,500 fish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>The following shall be provided to the Point of Contact at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center:</p>
<p>1 Provide a monthly update by email or telephone on the status of tasks 1 and 2.<br /><br />2 Provide standard statistics on intra-population variability such as: He, number of alleles, allelic richness, Fis, HWE, etc.</p>
<p>3 Provide standard statistics on inter-population variability such as: test for significant differences among collections, F statistics, neighbor-joining tree, etc.</p>
<p>4 Meet with point of contact at a midpoint in the data analysis to coordinate analyses and reporting scheme.</p>
<p>5 Provide a final report with methods/materials, results of statistical analyses, discussion of results, and a genotypic data file in "genepop" format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>&nbsp;Place of Performance Task 1 will be performed at the NWFSC, Mukilteo Research Station. Task 2 will also be performed at the NWFSC, Mukilteo Research Station.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Period of Performance.&nbsp;From date of award to&nbsp;September 30, 2009.</p>
<p>Interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to 206-526-6025 or email (melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov) . This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.</p>
<p>**** The Westren Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registey (CCR) as of October 1, 2003. After this date, NO award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http//www.ccr.gov .
