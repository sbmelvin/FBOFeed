<DESC>This is a market survey issued to solicit statements of interest from sources that have capability to provide support services for FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute, Human Factors Research Division (see attached Draft Statement of Work).  The services are follow-on to FAA Contract DTFAAC-05-D-00021 with Xyant Technology Inc.  The FAA intends to acquire services for the performance period beginning October 2010.
Responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to solicit in a full and open competition environment, or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The Market Survey will assist in determining the acquisition strategy, and obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.  
This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey, therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense.
Potential sources of these services are expected to be categorized in the Sector 541720 of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  This NAICS code is described as Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities.  The size standard for NAICS 541720 is $7 Million. 
A copy of the draft Statement of Work for CAMI Human Factors Research Support Services is attached.  All interested sources must submit a summary of their experience and capability to perform research of the same or similar type (one response per vendor) and for performance that was conducted within the past five years.  The Customer name, dollar value of the work performed, and deliverables must be identified.  Submit the response on company letterhead.

THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This opportunity is only available to the contractor awarded Malo East Lake Stewardship Project the contract for work in response to Solicitation No. AG-05G1-S-09-9018, on the Republic Ranger District, Ferry County, WA, Colville National Forest. That contractor is Vaagen Brothers Lumber, Inc.  565 West Fifth Avenue, Colville, WA 99114, Telephone: 509-684-5071. The original solicitation was competitively advertised and awarded based on best value criteria. The Government intends to award a single task order based on pre-established firm fixed prices derived from the basic contract. This project will be partially or wholly funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds and is subject to all reporting requirements thereto. 

The Malo East Lake Stewardship Project is an integrated resource basic contract AG-05G1-C-09-9015 that generally includes logging/forest product removal, fuel reduction, road construction, landing and woody biomass removal.  The issuance of Task Order 4 is specifically awarded for fuel reduction service work that involves woody biomass removal, machine and hand ladder fuel reduction, hand slash piling and creation of shaded fuel breaks.  This work will result in retaining healthy, vigorous understory trees to improve tree conditions and forest health, reduce ladder fuels located beneath overstory trees to reduce individual tree torching potential, provide a fuel loading profile that promotes defensible space for fire suppression, and for the re-introduction of fire in the project area. Fuel loading objectives relate to the remaining tons/acre and size of material left after treatment.  The area treated is approximately 1,268 acres. The resultant contract(s) will be a firm-fixed price.  Subcontracting opportunities may be available.

<RESPDATE>062510

<DESC>The National Assessment Governing Board is preparing to set cut scores on the Grade 12 Reading and Mathematics 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) to represent student preparedness for placement in a college course that counts as credit toward fulfilling general education requirements. There will be one standard setting study to set a preparedness cut score for the reading NAEP, and another study to set a preparedness cut score for the mathematics NAEP. The Governing Board will issue a Request for Proposals under full and open competition in late July, 2010. Proposals will be due around August 23, 2010. The period of performance is anticipated to be approximately 12 months.
<p>The Governing Board has used a modification of the bookmark standard setting method for setting achievement levels for NAEP in recent years and expects to implement a bookmark-based methodology for these preparedness studies. A design document is being developed to describe the procedures to be implemented for these two studies, which are part of the larger set of judgmental standard setting studies to be implemented in the Governing Board's 12th grade preparedness research program. The final design document will describe the study design to be implemented for the procurement, and it will be a part of the RFP when it is issued.</p>
<p>The basis for contract award is that all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to the solicitation. The Request for Proposal will appear on the NAGB website http://www.nagb.org when it is posted on Fedbizopps. All timely responses received shall be considered by the Governing Board. A cost reimbursement type contract is contemplated because of the uncertain costs surrounding this innovative research. Previous standard setting work on behalf of the Governing Board has been for setting achievement levels for grades 4, 8, and 12; this is the initial effort to set a preparedness cut score for higher education.<br />Questions and comments on this notice may be submitted to the Contract Officer, Moira Baran, by Monday, June 25, 5 pm, EST at Moira.Baran@ed.gov, and responses will be posted by approximately five working days after receipt.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate, on a non-competitive basis, with Georgetown University Medical Center, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Neurology and Psychology, Washington DC 20057, for professional services to support the NIMH's investigation plan of auditory processing of complex sounds in the rSTG. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0 million.<br /><br />The NIMH, Section on Cognitive Neuroscience in the Laboratory of Neuropsychology (SCNLN) conducts basic research on the neural mechanisms underlying such cognitive functions as perception, memory, and emotion in non-human primates. A major focus of the lab has been to examine auditory cortical processing streams and the mechanisms supporting different types of auditory perception and memory. However, there is still a paucity of information about the auditory cortical processing streams in monkeys, particularly at levels beyond the primary and second auditory areas. Part of the SCNLN ongoing work is aimed at gaining some understanding of the cerebral circuits mediating not only auditory memory but also primate vocal communication, in the hope that this may help lay the groundwork for unraveling the circuitry underlying human speech and language. NIMH's efforts to understand auditory processing the proposed project are undertaken to elucidate the relationship between neuronal activity in the auditory cortex and sound perception. Specifically, the SCNLN researchers are interested in the abilities of non-human primates in perceiving and remembering complex sounds, including monkey vocalizations, and how auditory cortical single neuron responses relate to behavioral performance.
<p>Auditory responses of superior temporal neurons outside the early auditory areas (core, belt, and parabelt areas) have rarely been examined systematically. Only a few studies have investigated the neuronal basis of species-specific vocalization processing in macaque monkeys; the anterolateral (AL) belt region and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vPFC). These two cortical areas are anatomically connected through the rostral part of the superior temporal gyrus (Hackett et al., 1998; Romanski et al., 1999). Furthermore, recent noninvasive imaging studies have shown that the rostral portion of the superior temporal gyrus (rSTG) was differentially activated when animal process conspecific sounds (Poremba et al., 2004; Petkov et al., 2006). NIMH researchers predict that neurons in the rSTG play an essential role for the processing of complex sounds especially to species-specific vocalizations and there is a hierarchy of functional organization of auditory processing that exists in the superior temporal cortex, just as it does for visual processing in the inferior temporal cortex. It is plausible that a subset of neurons in the rSTG responds more selectively to complex and behaviorally significant sounds than do neurons in the early auditory areas.</p>
<p>NIMH-SCNLN plans to use behavioral and electrophysiological measures to evaluate how neurons in rSTG respond to monkey calls in alert monkeys. The SCNLN researchers have recent data that demonstrates the rSTG contains a large proportion of auditory responsive neurons that are highly selective to complex sounds (Kikuchi et al., Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 30, 2004). The SCNLN researchers also have shown that a number of neurons in the rSTG exhibit long-latency, sustained excitatory activity in response to many sounds, but preferentially to certain complex sounds, such as monkey vocalizations and often heard environmental sounds. These neurons, located within the ventral auditory processing stream, are therefore likely to contribute to the discrimination/identification of familiar auditory stimuli and/or complex sounds (Kikuchi et al. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 32, 2006).</p>
<p>NIMH-SCNLN plans to extend the investigations of auditory processing of complex sounds in the rSTG. Initial experiments will compare responses in the early auditory areas (e.g. belt areas) so that the researchers can compare directly the neuronal response properties near the two end stations of the stimulus-quality processing stream. If, as presumed, the stream is organized hierarchically, there should be a larger proportion and greater selectivity of vocalization-tuned neurons in the rostral station than there is in the caudal station. The researchers will also enlarge the lab's sample of monkey vocalizations by adding digitally recorded vocalizations of monkeys familiar to the experimental subjects, on the possibility that this will increase the proportion and selectivity of call-responsive cells. Finally, to see if the long-latency, sustained neuronal response might be a signal of call discrimination/identification, researchers will degrade the vocalizations by inserting varying amounts of white noise and then measure whether, at the threshold for discrimination between degraded calls and white noise, correct responses to the degraded calls are associated more often than are incorrect responses with these long-latency, sustained responses.</p>
<p>Dr. Rauschecker of Georgetown University is a widely recognized expert in auditory processing in macaque monkeys. He has published numerous papers and has been a regular collaborator with this lab. Dr. Kukichi of Georgetown University has performed some of the work on which the proposed experiments are based, thus the proposed collaboration provides the NIMH-SCNLN the most efficient means to complete the proposed research. The collaborators are experienced with all aspects and have the means by which to carry out the proposed studies.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following tasks to include:</p>
<p>1. Neurophysiological studies in at least two monkeys as outlined above and using both standardized as well as specially designed tests of auditory discrimination and/or memory. <br />2. Direction on specific methodologies to be used. The team at Georgetown University includes investigators who are experts in each of the above methodologies, and they will provide whatever training that may be required. The specific design of each study will be worked out by the collaborative research team together with the contractor.</p>
<p>It has been determined that Drs. Rauschecker and Kukichi of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Neurology and Psychology, Georgetown University are the only source qualified to perform the services. No other sources will satisfy the agency's requirement.</p>
<p>The acquisition is a fee-for-service type. The period of performance for this project is to be one year from the award date with option for three (3) one-year optional periods. Work to be performed at NIH, NIMH facility and at Georgetown University.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) intends to award a sole source contract for the follow-on Government Furnished Equipoment (GFE) production modification of the Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS), APG-65 Lot III Reliability Improvement Program Operational Test Program Set (OTPS), G81S00010-3.  NAWCAD is contemplating award to End To End, Inc., Portsmouth, VA as the only source that could supply the modified/upgraded OTPS in time to meet workload requirements. Without this essential repair equipment the F/A-18 will not be able to repair RADAR components that are required to perform the operational mission of the aircraft.  NAWCAD previously awarded a procurement to End to End to upgrade the GFE OTPS to improve the reliability and maintainability and to provide a technical data package representative of the newly designed OTPS.  However, no drawings or data were purchased for the corrections to the original design/configuration nor were any vendor modification instructions delivered that would allow another contractor to modify an existing unit.  End to End has modified 19 units under a previous contract and will be doing so to an additional 35 units under the proposed procurement.  As the orginal equipment manufacturer of the redesign, End to End is considered to be the only source that has the technical data necessary to perform this effort without a costly reverse engineering and/or further redesign.  The Government requires deliveries of the modified units to commence within 60 days after award at a rate of 46 units per month.  The authority for this sole source action is FAR 6.302-1: only one responsible source.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based on the responses received to this synopsis is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This is not a request for proposals; however, all responses to this notice must be received within 15 days.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division intends to solicit on a sole source basis for a purchase order to Raytheon Company, 1847 West Main Road, Portsmouth, RI 02871-1087 for a continuation of basic research for the development of unique mathematical and statistical algorithms.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has requested that the Raytheon CAD/CAC algorithms be adapted to a variety of systems and demonstrate this capability over the next several years. This specific effort will involve the extension of these algorithms to another sensor system for the Naval Facilities Command.  Only Raytheon has the unique knowledge base, the facilities, and the experienced personnel necessary to successfully conduct the work.  The key personnel have invested over nine years in gaining the unique knowledge, insight, and skills necessary. Additionally, the algorithms developed by Raytheon represent many work years under other Raytheon/DOD contracts and Raytheon's own independent research and development (IRAD).  The algorithms are very sophisticated and require specialized knowledge to use properly thus another vendor cannot easily or cost-effectively duplicate them.  Results will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Therefore, it is in the Government's best interest to purchase these Through Water Communication Kit components from Undersea Systems International, since it provides for commonality between systems and reduced integration costs.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are beingrequested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   Refer to RFQ-OH-10-00106 when responding to this request. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-41. This acquisition is set-a-side for small business. The NAICS code is 541380-Testing Laboratories, the size standard is twelve (12) million dollars.  
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Sustainable Technology Division, located in Cincinnati, Ohio has a requirement for an Urban Soils Survey and Hydrologic Characterization Work for Sustainable Use of Vacant Land in Cleveland, Ohio. 
All services shall be provided to the U.S. EPA National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Sustainable Technology Division, located in Cincinnati, Ohio. The F.O.B. point shall be destination.  Price quotes shall include any setup charges. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this to this acquisition.

Statement of Work:
Statement of Work:  Urban Soils Survey and Hydrologic Characterization Work for Sustainable Use of Vacant Land in Cleveland, OH
1. Background and Purpose
Post-industrial cities share the problems of ageing civic and water infrastructure, a depleted tax base and underserved populations lacking in basic environmental services and opportunity. On the other hand, these same urban core areas possess significant natural resource capitals in terms of what are presently unmanaged vacant lots, riparian areas, and culverted stream systems. Due to the expense of legal actions against large cities for violations of the Clean Water Act (1972) for combined sewer overflows, governmental authorities have started to look for ways of managing storm flows without resorting to traditional, capital-intensive wastewater infrastructure. One option to decrease the storm flow quantity is to use vacant land and its soil pore space for detention of excess storm water runoff volume. However, more specific data is required to understand the potential for using highly-variable urban soils for storm runoff volume detention and its subsequent redistribution. Soil investigations will be conducted on a selection of vacant lot areas to develop a representative soil map that accounts for major sources of variability in soil formation, horizonation, excavation and land-grading associated with construction and demolition activities, among other attributes. This updated, detailed soil sampling and mapping will inform environmental managers on the potential for soil management and how to best utilize soil resources in adding detention capacity to the various ("sewershed") drainage areas, quantify variation in infiltration capacity, and establish soil capabilities and limitations in the context of this overall effort. Due to the unique objectives, we have to obtain a good representation of soil conditions throughout a highly-heterogeneous land mass.
2. Logistics and tasks 
1.	The contractor shall create a Quality Assurance Project Plan for the overall project.  2.	Starting July 12, 2010 and finishing July 31, 2010, USEPA will take nominal 2 inch diameter by 4 feet  depth (or to refusal ) soil cores. The cores will be left in the acetate core sleeves. USEPA will accumulate cores over a a three day period, and the vendor shall be responsible for picking up the core at  either a field location (to be determined) or at the USEPA R5 office in Westlake OH), and transporting the cores to the vendor's office-laboratory.
3.	The contractor shall spend July 12-15 2010 with the USEPA.  The first cores will be taken under the supervision of the contractor, who will at that time establish with USEPA staff protocols in preserving and transporting soil cores.
4.	The contractor shall instruct USEPA on how the cores should be preserved (e.g., in a half-section of a PVC tube) and transported. Any type of tube or sample holder for transport shall be provided by the contractor.
5.	The contractor shall conduct descriptions of up to 150 soil cores (total) as per details in the next section on approach and QA/QC; and subsample each horizon of each soil core (as per next bullet point instructs), and the vendor will arrange for transport or shipment of soil sub-samples to a soil characterization laboratory. 

6.	Based on grouping sets of soil cores by similarity in their descriptions, the contractor shall look for similarities in description of horizons that will allow for pooling samples for lab analysis, thus reducing the total number of samples that require lab analysis. The number of cores is not to exceed  forty (40) cores with three horizons (120 subsamples to lab), and ten (10) soil core samples with four horizons (40 more subsamples to lab), will be representative of the larger overall sample set of soil cores, and adequate to determine generalized soil chemical properties.
Details:
Soil DescriptionA complete pedon description of each component identified in the study area shall be written by the Contractor and the taxonomy of the soil core (nominal pedons, pedons hereon) shall be detailed and, if possible or suggested, related to a well-defined, existing soil type. 	Where possible, the number of pedons that are sub-sampled for chemical analysis shall be based on similarities in soil composition and arrangement of diagnostic horizons among the soil cores. Samples shall also be subject to lab analyses including (grinding-sieving, pH, organic carbon determination, particle size analysis, exchangeable base determination, and titratable acidity). Laboratory analysis shall be performed by a suitable, certified soil characterization laboratory. USEPA shall inspect and at their option approve laboratory analysis protocols as written and held by the contractor's laboratory.
Soil survey standards from the National Soil Survey Handbook [Section 627.08(d)(2)] and the Soil Survey Manual shall be followed.  Quality assurance protocol shall be carried out by the contractor. 
As stated above, the Contractor will spend July 12-15, 2010 to ensure that core sampling protocol is understood and that the vendor has an opportunity to advise on dealing with sampling under highly-variable soil conditions, and protection and preservation of soil cores. 
Development of MapThe contractor shall develop a map.  All map units shall be consociations with a single component representing a homogeneous unit, except for asphalt, concrete, buildings, or other manmade (impervious) surfaces included in the delineations.  A series name shall be used to identify the component wherever possible.  Where a series name cannot be used, a soil family shall be used to identify the component.  One site shall be selected from each map unit identified, to typify soil characteristics of that map unit and to serve as a basis for soil classification based on Keys to Taxonomy (11th edition).
Map units shall be labeled with a combination of two digit numeric symbol representing the taxonomic unit followed by an alphabetic character representing slope.  If other phases are needed, they shall be designated by a numeric symbol following the slope phase.  Special feature symbols shall be used, if needed and will represent point features. The map shall be digitized; all sample locations and transect points shall be georeferenced (by USEPA) using GPS at the time of sampling. A legend of map symbols and map unit names along with a conversion table (that will add provide greater detail (order-1 resolution) by giving a taxonomy to soils presently designated as urban land complex) based on map units currently identified by NRCS in the Soil Survey of Cuyahoga County, laboratory data, and pedon descriptions shall be provided.  In addition, a populated attribute database shall be developed and tables shall be generated.
Deliverables: 

Descriptions and soil laboratory analysis shall be completed no later than August 30, 2010; a draft report including descriptions of pedons, map unit descriptions, tables, maps, laboratory data, and spatial filed shall be delivered to the USEPA technical lead by November 1, 2010.  The USEPA technical lead will provide comments to the contractor by November 15, 2010.  The final report shall incorporate comments from USEPA and data be delivered in its final form by December 15, 2010.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Requirement:
<p>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Denver, Colorado that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 15,220 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 13,235 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years, 5 firm. The space must be available for occupancy by November 20, 2011. The delineated area is within 2 city blocks of the Alfred A. Arraj Federal Building.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull; 17 structured parking spaces.<br />&bull; T1 line</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>The objective of the work is to measure the loads induced in the lifting mechanism for the upper service gate at Lockport Lock, Joliet Illinois.  All testing will be performed in the controlled environment of the building, which houses the machinery to minimize temperature effects in the strain gage responses. Compensation for bending effects will be achieved electronically through a Wheatstone bridge by appropriately mounting the two strain gages on each of the members tested. The two strain gages are necessary to monitor axial strain and compensate for bending effects. The gage configuration will allow all fourteen (14) anchor end rods of the lift cables to function as load cells in the case that any load distribution adjustments on the cables are necessary.  Period of Performance is within 5 days of award.<BR>

Description

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for the procurement of approximately $3.4 billion in goods and services for the Medical/Surgical and Prosthetic and Sensory Aids (MSP) per year.  Currently, the VA's enterprise supply chain management for these commodity lines is fragmented and is not able to efficiently manage the current demand.  The VA is therefore in need of an Advanced Supply Chain Capability (ASCC) to provide an improved and modernized integrated enterprise MSP supply value chain management capability.

Services are required to conduct a VA enterprise MSP supply chain assessment for the purposes of identification and documentation of performance improvements required to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the operation of the VA MSP supply chain.  The assessment will deliver a recommendation for the process improvements, policy changes, professional services, information systems and any associated tools required to support enhanced VA enterprise MSP supply chain management operational function.  The assessment shall focus on the operation of the VHA supply chain for the acquisition of MSP.

Key VA organization levels include, but are not limited to: VA Medical Centers (VAMC), Veteran Integrated Services Networks (VISN), National Acquisition Centers (NAC), VA Health Administration (VHA) and supported National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) field offices, the VA Central Office (VACO), and the VA Program Management Office (PMO).

The Government intends to make a single award.  It is anticipated that the awarded contract will be for a period of 8 months.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541611.  This acquisition will be a full and open, unrestricted competition.  The solicitation will be issued on or about May 28, 2010 with an anticipated close date of on or about June 30, 2010.

<DESC>Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (SRNS), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS) for the Department of Energy, solicits expressions of interest from companies wishing to license a new development in railroad personnel safety, the Railcar Switchman Platform.&nbsp; Engineers at the Savannah River Site (SRS) have devised a new a new railcar switchman<br />platform for enhanced safety of railroad personnel. The switchman platform is designed to attach to the railcar ladder providing a stable platform from which the switchman can perform their duties.<br /><br />Under normal operations railcars are pushed or shoved by the locomotive and a switchman is required to ride on the lead car to flag and provide watch for the locomotive engineer. These functions normally require the switchman to ride on the ladder attached to the side of the railcar.<br /><br />With the switchman platform, which can be attached to the railcar ladder, it provides a stable platform upon which the switchman can ride in a normal standing position. Performing these duties in a standing position allows the switchman greater stability and hands-free operation to operate the emergency brake, radio, or provide flag signals to the engineer. The attached<br />handrails allow the switchman to work independently of the ladder and face in any direction. In addition the platform is designed to provide standard clearances for the platform while in use. The configuration allows it to be close to the railcar for horizontal clearances and high enough to clear standard manual switch equipment. Savannah River Site has 64 miles of railroad on site<br />and this equipment has been designed, developed, and successfully deployed for railroad shipment operations at SRS since 2008. A patent has been filed on this invention with the US Patent and Trademark Office.<br /><br />Any company interested in licensing this device and commercializing it as a product must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later that 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and<br />motivation for pursuing this opportunity. Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology. Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice.

<p>PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the government requirement to perform production, sustainment, modification, and engineering support for platform specific EGI units. Our acquisition strategy is to procure EGI's from fall of 2010 through CY11 for the 647 AESS. The projected unit quantities for production must range from 400-600 per year. The projected unit quantities for repairs must be in the range of 600-800 per year with 120 days or less.<br /><br />Potential sources must have EGI system that meets the requirements and capabilities to incorporate the unique integration requirements of the platforms. These contracts will include acquisition and sustainment of integration and production units, missionization/modification of software and hardware for platform specific interfaces, integration/flight test support, technical support following missionization and integration efforts, engineering studies, and contractor depot repair. Technical capability growth will be achieved through potential engineering change proposals and modifications for enhanced EGI capability including but not limited to Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Modules (SAASM), next generation Inertial Navigation Components, Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALs), and Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE). The government does not possess a technical data package due to the proprietary rights of the EGI with the current vendors.</p>

<DESC>****ATTENTION****ALL FORMAL COMMUNICATION RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION MUST BE DIRECTED TO: Joni Swaim, Contracting Officer, email: joni.swaim@us.army.mil.  No telephone calls will be accepted. The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aviation & Missile Command Contracting Center intends to issue a three-year, Firm Fixed Price, (Basic + two-100% Options) requirements type contract which covers various CH-47 parts.  The proposed acquisition consists of 67 nomenclatures, National Stock Numbers (NSNs), Army Part Numbers (APNs) with maximum quantities for each item.  Options will be placed against this contract as requirements materialize for the various items for Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 through FY 2013.   This requirement is restricted to The Boeing Company (CAGE:  77272) because the data needed to procure these parts competitively are not physically available, cannot be obtained economically, nor is it possible to draft adequate specifications of the material for a competitive solicitation and the government also lacks rights to data needed to purchase this part from additional sources.  The Government has been unable to economically buy the data rights to the data.  Adequate technical data is not available for this acquisition.  All offerors must meet prequalification requirements in order to be eligible for award.  Firms that recognize and can produce the required item described above are encouraged to identify themselves.  Firms are encouraged to seek source approval in order to compete for future solicitations by accessing the website www.redstone.army.mil/cmo/ and looking under Standard Aviation and Missile Source Approval Request (SAMSAR).

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality ContractingCenter Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, 07806-5000, on behalf of PM Close Combat Systems is seeking proven manufacturers with extensive experience and facilities in place to produce HMX/Resin explosive composition, stab primers, detonators, fuzing (Safe and Arm) components/assemblies, and/or Load, Assemble, and Pack (LAP) of explosively filled ammunition.  
These components are utilized in the production of the M4E1 Selectable Lightweight Attack Munition (SLAM).  For background information purposes, the M4E1 SLAM is a multipurpose, one-shot, anti-materiel/demolition device, compact, lightweight munition with antidisturbance and self-destruct features.  The M4E1 SLAM operates in four (4) different modes: Bottom Attack (Magnetic), Side-Attack (Passive Infrared), Time Demolition, and Command Detonation (Blasting Cap).  The M4E1 SLAM is designed to be readily portable and hand-emplaced against lightly armored infantry vehicles, parked aircraft, wheeled or tracked support vehicles, and ammunition or Petroleum, Oil and Lubrication (POL) storage sites.  The M4E1 SLAM includes magnetic and Passive Infrared sensors, munition controls, electronic packaging, and an EFP (Explosively Formed Penetrator) warhead.  
Interested Sources are sought for the below M4E1 SLAM Components:

a.  HMX/Resin explosive composition capabilities are to include availability and listing of materials, skills, and facilities required to handle, manufacture, and store up to a maximum of 2,480 lbs per year.  Total Net Explosive Weight (NEW) of HMX/Resin per warhead is .62 lbs.
b.  Battery stab primer capabilities needed for the activation of the SLAM single cell High Energy Density (HED) battery are to include availability and listing of materials, skills, and facilities required to handle, manufacture, and store up a maximum of 4,000 units per year.  The stab primer shall be .144 diameter and .140 height.  The composition shall consist of barium nitrate, lead azide, and primer mix NOL #130.  Total NEW per unit is .020 grams.

c.  Detonator assembly capabilities needed for the SLAM Safe and Arm (S&A) fuzing are to include availability and listing of materials, skills, and facilities required to handle, manufacture, and store a maximum of 4,000 units per year.  The detonator assembly is also used on M759 and FMU-151/B.  The detonator assembly shall be .0875 diameter and .266 height.  The composition shall consist of a primer mix, lead azide, and RDX.  Total NEW per unit is .032 grams.
d.  Fuzing (Safe and Arm) capabilities needed for the activation of the SLAM S&A are to include availability and listing of materials, skills, and facilities required to handle, manufacture, and store a maximum of 4,000 units per year.  The SLAM fuzing (Safe and Arm) consists of 2 piston actuators, a base and cylinder to hold the assembly, cam, enable transfer, insulated stand-off terminals, rotor, the above stated detonator assembly, and firing pin with shear wire.
e.  LAP capabilities needed for the SLAM are to include availability and listing of materials, skills, and facilities required to handle, manufacture, and store a maximum of 4,000 units per year.  The LAP process includes the warhead and explosive train build/assembly.  The SLAM S&A components are out of line prior to firing.  When the SLAM arms, one of the safety locks is removed by the initiation of the first piston actuator.  When a fire signal is received from the SLAM electronics, the explosive train is moved in line and is fired by the second piston actuator.  The detonator within the S&A rotor when initiated causes the detonation of the acceptor lead.  The acceptor lead then fires the transfer lead which then fires the Precision Initiated Coupler (PIC) which detonates the warhead.
Information being submitted should include submitting organizations name/address/point of contact identification, size standard, and cage code of the facility.  If any of the listed capabilities are to be subcontracted, the same information should be provided for the subcontractor as well.  Interested sources should submit their responses not later than 1400 hrs EST on 10 June 2010 to ATTN:  Elizabeth Stanley, 973-724-5369, Building 9, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806-500.

Responses are requested no later than close of business (4:30PM EST) June 11, 2010.  An electronic response in MS Word of Adobe PDF format is the accepted method.  <BR><BR><BR>DRAFT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT <BR>1.0 Scope. The scope of this effort is to provide test and evaluation support to the Joint Program Executive Officer for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), Joint Project Manager for Individual Protection (JPM-IP).  Objectives of this effort include the scope of support associated with testing and technical analysis of individual protection systems, components and technologies in support of Joint Service requirements for chemical warfare protection.  <BR><BR>1.1 Background. JPM-IP is responsible for providing all Joint Combatant Commands (COCOM), through the JPEO-CBD, with various Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) solutions to protect against the range of CB threat scenarios that may be encountered on the battlefield.  As Joint Forces are the leading edge of US warfighting, stability and peacekeeping operations, they will increasingly operate within areas where equipment and personnel could be exposed to highly toxic chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) agents (to include both traditional and non-traditional agents), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs).  Exposure to these agents, TICs and TIMs pose a significant threat to Joint operations and is an area of keen interest to the Joint Services as US Forces must be capable of surviving, safely operating and sustaining operations within CBRN hazard, TIC and TIM threat environments.<BR><BR>2.0 General Requirements. The Respondent shall provide a capability statement regarding the ability to provide continuous support as stipulated below: <BR><BR>Technical Support<BR>Schedule/Performance Support<BR>Cost Control<BR><BR>The scope of work associated with each of these task activities will vary by activity and may range from simple to complex. The Respondent should demonstrate capability for providing suitable test, technical and analysis expertise to support the tasks delineated by the activity to enable JPM-IP to successfully research, develop and ultimately field Individual Protection capabilities to all of the Department of Defense components.  <BR><BR>2.1 Specific Requirements. <BR><BR>2.1.1.	Technical Support.  JPM-IP is responsible for the research, development, procurement, fielding and overall lifecycle management of all individual protective equipment programs for the JPEO-CBD.  In this capacity, JPM-IP provides individual protective ensembles that offer enhanced ocular, inhalation and percutaneous protection against chemical and biological (CB) threats.  Inherent within this responsibility are requirements to validate that the protective equipment developed and fielded meets the projected effectiveness against agents, TICs and TIMs as identified by the Joint Forces.  The Contractor will assist JPM-IP to this aim with testing and technical analysis support of developmental, current and future IPE through qualified and experienced personnel, certified facilities, materials, supplies and equipment to perform the tasks as outlined and further specified within contract delivery or task orders.  This includes developing test plans and protocols; providing validated test equipment and investigative subject matter expertise in direct support of technical analysis and testing; conducting test item control of samples; conducting tests, collecting data and providing technical analysis of characteristics, equipment, systems and subsystems as well as projected effectiveness of IPE against Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), TICs and TIMs.  Specific tests the Contractor will be responsible for conducting include, but not limited to, First Article Testing (FAT), Production Lot Testing (PLT), Physical Properties as well as swatch and system level testing.  Technical analysis and testing of IPE will encompass individual components and system level testing of the entire protective ensemble.  <BR><BR>The Contractor will also be responsible for special project and non-standard test support as specified by contract delivery or task orders.  Actions may include field user evaluations of IPE and consumables to determine operational effectiveness, suitability and survivability; Developmental/Operational Test (DT/OT) support as well as test methodology development to address emerging threats, developmental and improved IPE technologies.  The Contractor will be responsible for supporting these efforts with expert understanding of program activities associated with new equipment introduction (e.g. FAT) as well as equipment in production (e.g. PLT).  <BR><BR>The Contractor will be responsible for supporting these activities with expert test and technical analysis support necessary for test protocols and methodology development, assessments, evaluations, analyses, recommendations, deliverable reports and related input.  Emphasis will also be placed on the Contractors ability to identify and resolve issues as well as effective use of resources to meet customer requirements and schedules through the use of quality practices.<BR><BR>2.1.2 Schedule/Performance Support.  JPM-IP is responsible for providing CB protective ocular, inhalation and percutaneous solutions that meet Joint Force requirements in accordance with Milestone Decision Authority-approved program milestones.   The Contractor is responsible for supporting the JPM-IP in meeting this goal through effective business and technical management by ensuring the quality of contract-required deliverables support scheduled milestones and/or periods of performance.  The critical facet of support includes the ability of the Respondent to conduct the required test(s), analyze data and provide the deliverable reports to JPM-IP within 30 calendar days after receipt of samples.  The availability and ability of the Respondent to provide effective staffing and resource utilization coincident with program objectives, and managing resources to accommodate priorities of work is also of great importance.  <BR><BR>2.1.3 Cost.  In addition to technical and schedule parameters, JPM-IP is also responsible for providing CB protective equipment on or under budget.  As a result, the Contractor will be responsible to providing efficient and effective cost control.  This includes the monitoring and management of costs associated with contract labor, travel and other direct costs when compared with the originally awarded contract value.  The Contractor will be required to submit monthly reports detailing progress for all cost type orders, cost expenditures and problems that they may be experiencing.<BR><BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>US Army RDECOM CC Natick Contracting Division <BR>Attn: CCRD-NA-SY Building 1, Kansas Street <BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011 <BR><BR>Place of Performance: <BR>JPM-IP <BR>50 Tech Parkway Suite 301 <BR>Stafford, VA 22556 <BR><BR><BR>

</ul>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">Established by Congress in 1970, the National Highway Institute (NHI) is the training and education arm of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) under the United States Department of Transportation. NHI's mission is to provide technical training and resource materials to the transportation community. NHI courses respond to changing workforce development requirements and provide technical professional development opportunities to engineers, designers, technicians, and bridge inspectors, among others in the highway bridge community.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The NHI plans to award a 5-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract for the development/update and presentation of training courses in the areas of Structures (Bridge Design and Inspection), Hydraulics, and Geotechnical engineering. Contractors can specify in which of these three program areas- or sub specialty areas-they feel qualified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The work requires skilled, knowledgeable and experienced subject matter experts (SMEs)-teaming with instructional systems designers (ISD) - to develop new curriculum materials and to update existing course materials.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the work requires instructors with superior subject matter expertise, adult learning experience and topic-related practical experience. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; tab-stops: 0in 2.5in">In terms of scope, the NHI maintains a training curriculum of approximately 250 courses and presents over 700 training sessions per year to more than 20,000 participants nationwide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The majority of the current NHI offerings are instructor-led training (ILT) within a classroom setting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But to meet the time challenges of customers and reach as many participants as possible, the NHI espouses distance learning options, with Web-Based Training (WBT), Web Conference Training (WCT), and blended learning opportunities available.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The IDIQ solicitation will involve both combined (development and delivery) and separate awards for ILT and distance learning developments and deliveries. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>To be considered for ILT course development, contractors will be required to provide a development team consisting of Subject Matter Experts and Instructional Systems Designers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For development of WBT, WCT and blended courses, the contractor team must include web training specialists, in addition to SMEs and ISDs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To be considered for ILT course delivery, contractors will be required to provide a delivery team consisting of subject matter experts who are also excellent instructors and preferably are experienced teaching adult learners.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; tab-stops: 0in 2.5in">Since 2004, NHI has been authorized by the International Association of Continuing Education and Training (IACET) to award Continuing Education Units (CEUs) to participants who successfully complete selected NHI training courses. One CEU is equivalent to ten contact hours of training. A typical "day" of an NHI course is 6 contact hours; hence, .6 CEUs are awarded for each "day" of an NHI offering. For those whose jobs require Professional Development Hours (PDHs), each hour of an NHI training session can be translated into one PDH. Additionally, several NHI courses are approved for State licensure programs and others serve as prerequisites for state certification curricula.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">The target audience for the NHI's courses are very broad, and include staff from Federal, state and local transportation and resource agencies; Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers; as well as tribal government representatives, academia, and consultants involved with transportation issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NHI website-<a href="http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/">http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/</a>- <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>provides a listing of current training courses, as well as information on resources, training philosophy, instructor standards, the NHI Standards Guide and many other related topics.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">NHI's goal is to optimize training for maximum effectiveness, ensuring that the greatest amount of learning takes place within certain defined constraints. Part of this process involves developing course materials precisely targeted to participant needs and providing clearly articulated Learning Outcomes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The principles of adult learning and ISD must be incorporated into the curriculum materials, as well as an end of course learning assessment (i.e. exam, skill demonstration, etc) in order to be consistent with IACET requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Classroom training includes a combination of instructional strategies, such as lectures, facilitated discussions, group exercises, case studies, and participant presentations.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; tab-stops: 0in 2.5in">Highly qualified, experienced and knowledgeable instructors have been the hallmark of NHI training courses. To be truly effective, instructor-led training requires skilled, competent, and credible instructors with relevant, project level experience-preferably experiences from various parts of the country. These instructors should be so well versed in their specialty within the Structures (bridge design and inspection), Hydraulics and Geotechnical engineering programs, that they can review an existing NHI Instructor Guide and be able to competently and compellingly teach an NHI course session in their particular specialty area.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; tab-stops: 0in 2.5in">Since the NHI training program is national in scope, individual course developments are rigidly designed according to the NHI Standards Guide and designated FHWA Program Office constraints. However, to make every NHI session relevant and a meaningful learning experience for participants, the instructors are required to do a significant amount of "pre-delivery homework" in advance of a course session.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, this means contacting the Local Host, the FHWA Division office and the State DOT among others to determine which local practice and customize training to reflect that; reviewing FHWA policy, State or local laws, regulations or practices in order to be prepared to address their relationship to comparable Federal requirements; and in some cases, working with the host to identify bridges suitable for course field trips.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; tab-stops: 0in 2.5in">Additionally, it is expected that the course instructors continually monitor course materials to ensure that they are accurate and contain the latest information; refresh case studies and group exercises if needed; incorporate examples of current best practices or notable projects; include reference resources that may be valuable to augment the existing materials; review completed course exams to determine if any questions need to be revised, eliminated or new questions written; and compile a listing of suggested improvements to discuss with the NHI Training Program Manager and FHWA Program Office lead. In terms of administrative responsibilities, there is a prescribed series of requirements that the instructors are expected to follow; a listing is available on the NHI website-- <a href="http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/">http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov/</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>-- under Resources.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; tab-stops: 0in 2.5in">Those interested in becoming instructors are required to take the NHI Instructor Development Course (IDC) -or an approved equivalent instructor training program&shy;&shy; with the aim of becoming certified as NHI instructors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NHI Instructor Liaison reviews the curricula from "equivalent instructor training programs" and determines if a waiver from the NHI IDC will be granted. College-level teaching experience should not be construed as automatically meeting the NHI instructor requirements. The procedure for becoming certified is explained more fully on the NHI Web site. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Additionally, online there is an NHI Instructor Development Module for Web Conference Training.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; tab-stops: 0in 2.5in">In terms of volume, many of the Structures, Hydraulics, and Geotechnical engineering courses under this solicitation are extremely popular and sessions are held simultaneously at various locations across the country. Contractors are expected to have teams of qualified instructors who can meet these demands with 30- 60 days notice. It is also expected that those interested in becoming contract instructors for the NHI have had the opportunity to either observe or enroll in an NHI course offerings and demonstrate their familiarity with the NHI teaching style and instructor requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; tab-stops: 0in 2.5in">&nbsp;From time to time, those awarded an ID/IQ contract will be invited to compete for award of task orders that may also include other functions relating to training development and delivery, such as needs assessment, marketing, or electronic formatting for Section 508 compliance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During certain course developments and updates, special studies and/or some research will be necessary for development of technical reference manuals to supplement course materials.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">Performance under the Task Orders is subject to the requirements of Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in 1998. Section 504 deals with accessibility for all participants in training classes. Section 504 specifically addresses classroom settings, course materials and accommodations for special needs. Section 508 addresses accessibility issues relative to electronic media such as web postings, web sites, computer simulations, and videos.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: .5in">The NHI follows Section 504/508 Compliance in all of its training development and delivery efforts. The NHI and its contractors must, to the greatest degree possible, meet all accessibility needs of its participants.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">NHI course offerings currently covered by expiring ID/IQ contracts in the area of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Structures, Hydraulics, and Geotechnical engineering</span> may be found on the NHI web site, under the 130XXX, 132XXX and 135XXX course number series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additional related courses or web-based offerings may be added as needs are defined.</p>

<DESC>NASA Request for InformationFeasible Technologies and Tools for the Nondestructive Evaluation Detection Of DefectsOccurring In Aerospace Composite Materials and ComponentsIntroductionThe Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) team supportsMSFC spaceflight hardware by using the best available NDE tools, which are applied tomaterials and structures to verify the required integrity and to detect characteristicflaws, discontinuities, and other defects in a structure or component, not normallydetectable by the naked-eye, in such a manner that the test does not harm the material inany way. This evaluation of a part or component is accomplished without causing physicalor chemical changes to the part or component, or otherwise impairing its adequacy foroperational service. This capability spans both metallic and composite/non-metallicmaterials and structures.The greater strength to weight ratio of composite materials makes them ideal for use inspacecraft.  However, composites can be difficult to inspect for flaws.  Conventional NDEmethods for composite structures have proven only partially adequate for the groupspurposes.  Effective NDE is one of the largest challenges preventing more widespread useof composite materials in space applications. The NDE team is seeking to improve its capabilities to detect defects in laminatedcomposites and bonded structures for both as-manufactured defects, as well as for thosecaused from service damage, or impact.	This would generally include the detection forfiber damage, kissing unbonds/weak bonds, delaminations, voids/porosity and matrixcracking; however improved detection is desired for all types of defects.  Because muchof the NDE work is done in the field, the team is also seeking techniques and instrumentsthat will enable improved field-testing.  Correlating these results to the quantitativemeasure of residual strength in the remaining structure would also be highly desirable. Areas of particular interest include honeycomb and foam core structures with principledefects including weak bonding, pore filleting, fiber damage and matrix cracking, hatstiffened or ribbed structures with principle defects including weak bonding and fiberdamage and fiber-reinforced foam structures with principle defects including webdelaminations, web to core unbonds and fiber damage.  Scope of ActivityIn order to facilitate a better understanding of how defects are created in compositematerials, the NDE Team is planning a study to determine how defects are created duringfabrication and in use; how the defects affect the performance of the material; and whichdefects are most mission-critical subsequently leading to catastrophic loss.  NASA isseeking existing effects of defects data that encompasses composite materials, thussaving the Agency the time and expense of recreating this defect data.

<DESC>In fiscal year 2011, NASA plans to begin the Technology Demonstrations MissionsProgram. One of the greatest challenges that NASA faces in incorporating advancedtechnologies into future missions is bridging the mid TRL gap (Attachment: TRLDefinitions) between early development and mission infusion. Maturing a space technologyto flight readiness status through relevant environment testing is a significantchallenge from both a cost and risk perspective. The primary goal of the TechnologyDemonstration Missions Program is to mature space technologies that are of benefit tomultiple customers through flight readiness and mission infusion. To support program formulation, The NASA Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) isseeking to identify candidate crosscutting system-level technologies to be demonstratedin relevant environmental conditions. Specifically, system-level technologies impliesan integrated spacecraft system and not component-level demonstrations. A key requirement in this program is that the technology under consideration must clearlybe crosscutting, defined as a technology with potential to benefit multiple NASA missiondirectorates, other government agencies, or the space industry. OCT is seeking technologydemonstration candidates that advance the technology readiness of the selected systems,provide tangible, innovative technology products, are cost effective, and capturesignificant public interest and awareness. The candidate technology must be mature (TRLof 3 to 5), and the proposed flight demonstration must raise the TRL of the candidatetechnology to a TRL of 6, such that it may be infused into the critical path for futureNASA missions. The information gathered from this RFI could be integrated into futureBroad Agency Announcements (BAA), Request for Proposals (RFP) or Space Act Agreements(SAA) for the Technology Demonstration Missions Program. For potential future solicitations, including NASA Research Announcements (NRA),Cooperative Agreement Notices (CAN), Announcements of Opportunity (AO) or SAAs, onlyflight demonstrations that can be completed within a maximum of three years will besought. To demonstrate a potential infusion path, flight teams will be required to have asponsor (or sponsors) to cost share the proposed demonstration. OCT expects that aminimum of 25% of the total Life Cycle Cost (LCC) be contributed by another sourceoutside the OCT under potential future funded opportunities. Competed flight testdemonstration opportunities will be open to teams involving NASA centers, industry, otherGovernment agencies and academia. Performing these flight demonstrations is intended to advance the readiness of theselected systems, provide tangible products capable of rapid infusion to NASA missions,and capture significant public interest and awareness. Executing these engaging andtechnically challenging space flight demonstrations, including designing the flight testprogram, building the flight hardware and performing/operating the flight demonstrationis an outstanding means for developing the current NASA and industry workforce to handlemore challenging and more sustainable space missions and operations in the future.Examples of the types of crosscutting technologies that may be considered for thistechnology demonstration program include (but are not limited to) optical communications,tether systems, autonomous rendezvous and docking/undocking, space power systems,humanoid robotics, inflatable/deployable deceleration systems, advanced in-spacepropulsion, aerocapture, landing/surface systems, and solar sails.

This platform serves as a critical data collection tool in the recently implemented Fisheries Sector Management Program. The increased importance of the IVR function requires a reliable backup server to be installed that provides redundancy. As Pulse Voice's proprietary software resides on the primary server, so must the backup server be configured with only Pulse Voice Inc. software.

Requirement

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease for the Cape Fear RC&D office in Wilmington, NC that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 495 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a maximum of 450 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for a period of 10 years, cancelable after 2 years upon 120 days notice.  The space must be available for occupancy by 10/01/2010.  The delineated area is the entire city limits of Wilmington, including:

NORTH: From the intersection of the Cape Fear River and Hwy 74/Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway to Hwy 117/N. College Rd.

EAST:  On a line south from the intersection of Hwy 74/Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway to Hwy 117/N. College Rd, following S. College Rd. to the intersection with Hwy 177/Shipyard Blvd.

SOUTH:  On a line west from the intersection of Hwy 177/S. College Rd. and Hwy 177/Shipyard Blvd. to the east bank of the Cape Fear River.

WEST: On a line north from the intersection of Hwy 177/Shipyard Blvd and the east bank of the Cape Fear River to Hwy 74/Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency down-time.

The intent of this RFI is to assist NAVAIR and PMA265 in conducting market research to identify if a contractor Depot Level Maintenance support facility to meet the Government's needs is available.
<p>Background: The F/A-18 A/B/C/D Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) analyzed select locations in the airframe to evaluate their life with a fleet usage based fatigue spectrum. Many of the locations analyzed had lives less than the United States Navy (USN) goal of 10,000 Flight Hours (FH) and may require repairs. The SLEP program builds upon SLAP and is designed to introduce High Flight Hour (HFH) inspections and SLEP modifications to the F/A-18 A/B/C/D variants. The USN currently conducts inspections of F/A-18 A/B/C/D aircraft as they reach 8,000 FH under the direction of the HFH bulletins. It is anticipated that the scope of the HFH inspections will be increased as a result of the SLEP findings.</p>
<p>Scope: In an effort to assess current industry capabilities, PMA265 has sponsored an Analysis of Options (AoO) to perform a HFH Inspections and SLEP modifications conceptual study looking at alternative Depot Level Maintenance support solutions. To support the AoO, a market survey is being conducted to obtain information regarding industry solutions to satisfy PMA265 requirements.</p>
<p>As a top level summary of required Depot Level Maintenance support and sustainment capabilities, the Depot Level Maintenance support and sustainment should be capable of meeting the following requirements:</p>
<p>Comprehensive disassembly, nondestructive testing, and inspection of forward, center, and aft fuselages, nacelles, inner wings, outer wings, vertical stabilators, Leading Edge Extensions (LEX), and aircraft systems / subsystems (including dynamic assemblies) and related aircraft components to assess severity of damage resulting from operational fatigue, the environment, maintenance, repair actions, and manufacturing defects. Aircraft systems / subsystems and related components include, but are not limited to: Landing, Arrestment and Catapult; Aircrew; Hydraulic; Avionics; Environmental Control; Flight Control; Fuel and Aerial Refueling; and Power Distribution / Electrical Power and Lighting.</p>
<p>Rework of existing aviation end items, systems, and components; manufacture of items and component parts otherwise not available; and services functions which include aircraft systems testing, professional engineering, technology, and calibration services.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
FSC: 4030 - Body, swivel hook - H46/H53 helicopter application;
The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego CA is issuing this "Market Research  -  Sources Sought" synopsis. Industry comments will be accepted by email.  The objective of this market research is to determine if there are existing companies that are qualified to manufacture and or supply the following product:Body Swivel Hook, part number: AC62243. This part/drawing number is from a 1981 Aeroquip Corporation, Industrial Division, Van Wert, OH, cage: 01276 drawing. The drawing is labeled with a "proprietary, do not disclose data" statement.
Recent discussions held with representatives of the Eaton Corporation dba Eaton Aerospace Division, Kinedyne Corporation and Breeze Eastern revealed that none of these companies could identity the part number. They could provide no useable information as to which company is currently manufacturing this part. Apparently, the Aeroquip Corporation was purchased by Eaton and then Eaton sold the product line to Kinedyne. Kinedyne referred the Navy to Breeze Eastern and this company had no knowledge of the part. At this point the Navy cannot identify sources of manufacture or supply nor can the drawing be utilized by the Navy because of the proprietary data statement. 
The DLA stock system shows a similar part number AC62238, cargo hook, nsn: 4030-01-315-7328 as an Eaton product. The required part AC62243 is not in the DLA system. The Fleet Readiness Center-Southwest, San Diego, CA currently still works on and repairs H46/H53 helos and has a need for the body, swivel hook as part of a cargo sling system used aboard the helos.
Contractors that are currently involved with this series of hooks in whatever capacity, manufacturing, distributing or who may have knowledge of this product are requested to contact the FISCSD point of contact as soon as possible.
This is not a request for proposal nor does the Government intend to pay for any information provided by industry in response to this market research sources sought synopsis.  
When responding to this notice, please provide your company name, address, point of contact, email address,  phone number, NAICS, and Cage Code. Your firm may submit catalogs, product literature published by manufacturers, distributors, and dealers, or available on-line web site address. The cutoff date for responses is June 16, 2010. 
Please direct all data and inquiries to Mr. Ralph A. Franchi, Contracting Officer, FISCSD, Regional Contracts Department, 619-532-2517, ralph.franchi@navy.mil

All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned.<br />The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) health-care provider surveys include the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). NHDS has, since 1965, provided critical information on the utilization of the nation's non-Federal hospitals and on the nature and treatment of illness among the hospitalized population. NHAMCS has provided data annually since 1992 concerning the nation's use of hospital emergency and outpatient departments. These data have been extensively used for monitoring changes and analyzing the types of care provided in the nation's hospitals. <br />NCHS is planning to integrate the data we collect from these two hospital surveys into one survey called the National Hospital Care Survey (NHCS). Beginning in 2011, NCHS will recruit a new sample of hospitals for this new survey. During this first year the survey will replace the National Hospital Discharge Survey, and hospitals will be asked to provide data on all inpatients from their administrative databases of Uniform Bills (UB-04s). Then in 2013, the sampled hospitals will be asked to provide data on the utilization of health care provided in their emergency and outpatient departments (ED and OPD) and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), thus integrating the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys into the NHCS. <br />The new NHCS will continue to provide the national general purpose health-care statistics that NHDS and NHAMCS currently provide. The new NHCS will have some distinct advantages. First, more information at the hospital level will be collected. Second, the survey will be able to sample hospital discharges with specific diagnoses and procedures for special studies that use medical record abstraction to collect more clinically relevant data. NCHS also plans to move toward collection of health-care data by electronic means as soon as hospitals participating in NHCS are able to provide such electronic data. In 2011 the UB-04s will be electronically transferred to NCHS. As hospitals adopt electronic medical records (EMRs), NCHS should be poised to accept electronic files from hospital medical records. <br />Toward that end, NCHS is seeking input in two areas; you may respond to either one or both topics:<br />A. Data collection instruments for the current NHAMCS include an induction interview questionnaire and patient record forms. All forms are paper. The induction interview is conducted in-person by a field representative (FR) from the U.S. Census Bureau. Data are abstracted from ED and OPD records and entered on the patient record form, pre-edited by the Census' National Processing Center, and sent to a contractor for data entry.
<p>Data collection instruments can be found at <br />http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/ahcd_survey_instruments.htm#nhamcs</p>
<p>NCHS is interested in evaluating state-of-the-art data collection approaches that allow efficient and flexible data collection for both the induction interviews and patient record forms. NCHS invites interested organizations that have relevant expertise to describe improved method of data collection. Data collection approaches may be different for each form, and may include one or more methods. Data collection approaches may include but are not limited to one or more of the following: paper forms, web-based instruments, and computerized data entry on a laptop or other device. <br /><br />i. The approach to data collection must lead to an increase in the efficiency of the survey and improve the timeliness with which the data are released. <br />ii. It should be indicated if the approach to collection improves data quality, thereby reducing the need for editing and funds required for data processing. <br />iii. The data collection must be flexible, to allow additional data elements to be added with regularity and without undue redesign.<br />iv. Hospitals that are participating currently in NHAMCS are given the choice as to whether they want to use the hospital staff to abstract the data or if they want the FR to abstract the data. The response to this RFI should indicate whether the suggested approach will permit this flexibility for the new survey.<br /><br />B. NCHS plans to move as quickly as possible to collecting clinical data from electronic medical records by electronic means. In 2011, this will include administrative data from UB-04s on hospital inpatients. Eventually, NCHS would like to collect data from electronic medical records as the hospitals move to electronic medical records. Hospitals have very different EMR capabilities. Some hospitals have limited EMR capabilities but have computerized laboratory records or electronic medication ordering and administrative records. Some hospitals have home grown computerized systems, and others use one or more of the many software venders. Not only are there many EMR/EHR vendors, but also a vendor typically customizes a system for each hospital.</p>
<p>NCHS is interested in evaluating approaches to obtaining electronic data from health-care facilities. NCHS invites interested organizations that have relevant expertise in extracting data from electronic medical records to describe this expertise and how this could be applied to enhance the data collected by the National Hospital Care Survey.</p>
<p>Response<br />NCHS will use the information obtained from responses to this RFI to refine its approach to collecting data through the new National Hospital Care Survey. NCHS invites interested organizations that have relevant expertise to submit a written response to CDC.<br />As a minimum, submitted information should include:<br />a) A description of the respondent's approach to addressing one or both of the issues above;<br />b) A description of the expected challenges in executing these approaches and achieving these objectives, and the manner in which the respondent's solution addresses these challenges;<br />c) A description of the technologies required for the proposed approach; and<br />d) The estimated costs of the proposed approach(es). <br />REMINDER: This is not a request for proposals. Supporting cost data are neither required nor requested. Any cost data provided, including estimates, are informational only, and will be used to help formulate and refine the Government Cost Estimate for this requirement. This is an aspect of market research only.<br />All information submitted to CDC will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant Federal law, including the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC 552) and the Trade Secrets Act (18 USC 1905). Information should be submitted by close of business June 30. Responses should be no more than 12 pages, in electronic format, and e-mailed to the attention of the technical contact person.</p>

<CONTACT>Dan Adams , Dan , Email DARPA-SN-10-49@darpa.mil
<DESC><p>&nbsp;FULL PDF VERSION OF THIS SPECIAL NOTICE IS ATTACHED</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will conduct a Proposers' Day briefing in support of the anticipated Clean-slate design of Resilient, Adaptive, Secure Hosts (CRASH) program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Any BAA released will be found on the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>
<p>Attendance at the Proposers' Day is voluntary and is not required to propose to subsequent BAAs (if any) or research solicitations (if any) on this topic. DARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this Proposers' Day. The Proposers' Day announcement does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or abstracts. Interested parties to this notice are cautioned that nothing herein obligates the Government to issue a future solicitation.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE <br />The CRASH program is seeking innovative research into the design of new computer systems that: <br />&bull; Are highly resistant to cyber-attack;<br />&bull; Can adapt after a successful attack in order to continue rendering useful services;<br />&bull; Learn from previous attacks how to guard against and cope with future attacks; and<br />&bull; Can repair themselves after attacks have succeeded.</p>
<p>Current computer systems are highly vulnerable to cyber attack. There are very few fundamental sources of the vulnerabilities exploited by cyber attackers. These attacks stem from the fact that current computer systems cannot enforce the intended semantics of their computations.</p>
<p>While these problems are not new, they have not been adequately dealt with largely because designers have been intellectually and institutionally bound by the need to maintain compatibility with legacy systems. These constraints have limited the range of hardware architectures, system software designs, programming languages, etc. that have been considered.</p>
<p>The CRASH program seeks to break these intellectual constraints by looking at the problem (as the name implies) from a clean slate perspective. In CRASH, the clean slate approach will involve the co-design of the hardware, system software, programming languages, design environments, and formal methods. The primary goal of this program is to design new techniques that can effectively solve the problems described above; compatibility and legacy concerns are secondary.</p>
<p>The CRASH program will include the following technical areas of interest:</p>
<p>1. Processor architectures<br />2. Operating systems<br />3. Formal methods<br />4. Programming languages and environments<br />5. Machine learning, self-adaptation, diagnosis, recovery, and repair<br />6. Dynamic diversification</p>
<p>GOALS <br /><br />The purpose of the Proposers' Day is to outline the CRASH program technical goals and challenges and to promote an understanding of the BAA proposal requirements. There will be Q &amp; A session following the presentation.</p>
<p>Information on the anticipated CRASH solicitation will be available on the TCTO solicitations page at http://www.darpa.mil/tcto/solicitations.html following the publication of the BAA in FedBizOpps. It is anticipated that the CRASH BAA will be released after the Proposers' Day. If a BAA is released, then materials presented at the Proposers' Day may be posted to the TCTO webpage along with a FAQ document compiling questions and answers from the Proposers' Day as well as from any interested offerors.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION</p>
<p>Participants MUST register at http://www.sa-meetings.com/DARPA_CRASH no later than 2359 on Tuesday, 01 June 2010. Registration is limited to 100 attendees. Only two representatives from each organization or institution may attend.</p>
<p>DATE AND LOCATION</p>
<p>The Proposers' Day will occur on Friday, 04 June 2010 from 0900 ET to 1300 ET at the Executive Conference Center at Liberty Center, 4075 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 350, Arlington, Virginia 22203. Registration opens at 0800 ET.</p>

Snelling, Minnesota, intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Komatsu America Corporation, Rolling Meadows, Illinois a PC35MR-3 mini-excavator. This mini-excavator is necessary to break up and remove beaver dam obstructions on various wetlands under Service management. The removal of these types of obstructions is inherently hard on tracks of equipment. This piece of equipment is equipped with multi-segment steel frame tracks with bolt-on composite track pads that allow for replacement of damaged segments at a minimal cost compared to the cost a whole track replacement. The maximum digging reach and digging depth of the equipment is also critical with this type of work for safety reasons. In addition the ability to angle the equipment blade is a necessary component. The combination of these specific features is necessary for enhanced equipment performance and safety.

<SOLNBR>N0016410SNB12
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:ellen.mcdaniel@navy.mil">POINT OF CONTACT</a>
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage serves as an alternative if the FBO website is unavailable.

Request for Information:  This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI.  NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane requests MARKET SURVEY information relative to a High Energy Density Systems (HEDS) Roadmap, which includes future technologies research and development (R&D), demonstrations, production plans, and readiness level timelines for airborne, sea, and land-based military applications in the following energy/power based areas:  Lithium Based Batteries, Other Electrochemical Batteries, Capacitive Storage, Fuel Cells, Advanced Energy Conversion/Power Systems, Packaging/Systemization, Energy Systems Management/Control, Advanced Applications Technology, and Safety/Risk.
Respond to this RFI by submitting one or more white papers as described below and by indicating your willingness to participate in a one-week workshop.
The objective of the project is to produce a strategic roadmap with key technological elements that will communicate the technology options for high energy density systems over a future timeframe.  The roadmap will be a tool for planning highly effective, safe, affordable high energy density systems (HEDS) for Navy systems.  Scope - HEDS used in U.S. Navy systems above the size of personnel-carried systems and below primary propulsion for ships.
Items under consideration in the roadmapping process:	Competitive Position	Pervasive Competencies	Systemic Challenges	Technology, Applications/Capability Timelines	Allied (companion, enabling) Technology Timelines	New knowledge/tradecraft requirements	Risk (including Safety/Heat)	Total Ownership Cost High Level	Dependencies	Drivers	Key Enablers/Impacts	Technology Gaps	Science & Technology Brickwalls	Critical Success Factors/Dependencies	Critical Success Factor Futures	Insights
Information will be technically evaluated by NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, other Navy, DoD, and Government organizations, and some academic and industry participants for the purposes of market research and the development of a HEDS Roadmap.
A HEDS Roadmap workshop is scheduled for 12-16 July 2010 at NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane and in Bloomington, IN.  Respondees to this announcement are asked to indicate their interest in participating in the HEDS Roadmap workshop.  Some respondees from academia and industry may be invited to participate as working group members for this workshop.  
The HEDS Roadmap workshop will be highly technical in nature; marketing and sales pitches will not be allowed.  Participants ideally will be chief engineers/scientists or other similar senior personnel with an orientation toward the energy and power sources expected to be achieved in the next 30 years.  

SAMPLE "WHITE PAPER" RESPONSE OUTLINE
Interested parties shall submit via email an initial synopsis. (commonly referred to as a "white paper")   Offerors should submit all correspondence (white papers, bio, comments) electronically to the NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane Contracting Office point of contact below NLT 2  PM EDT 05/10/2010.  Please insert "N00164-10-R-GS67 - HEDS" on all correspondence.
Submit a white paper of one page or less in length that briefly discusses one energy/power technology capability that will be a significant difference maker to the warfighter at any point between the years 2010 and 2040. For example, if you were to bet on a particular capability that could be in production during that timeframe that provided a highly significant return on investment, what would that capability be and why?  Also suggest potential applications that could incorporate this technology capability.  Respondees are encouraged to submit papers both on conventional capabilities as well as advanced and exotic capabilities.
Respondees may submit separate papers on as many such capabilities as they wish.  Such capabilities do not have to be within the current or planned product line of their employer.  Any technology readiness level may be considered that could result in at least small-scale manufacturing of that product by the year 2040.  
Respondees who wish to be considered for an invitation to participate in the workshop must submit a biography via email.  Invitees will be notified of workshop details.  Attendance at the HEDS Roadmap workshop is limited to U.S. citizens employed by the U.S. Government, U.S. academic institutions, and U.S. industry.
Note that the responses to this RFI may be viewed by academic/industry representatives within the working groups.  Therefore, do not submit any proprietary or confidential business sensitive information.
This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP), and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.  Any costs incurred by invited attendees or their employers relating to workshop participation will NOT be reimbursed. Any information submitted to the Government under this RFI will not be returned.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/crane/working/contracting.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Contracting webpage will serve as an alternative if the FBO website is unavailable.
Request for Information:  This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI.  NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane requests MARKET SURVEY information relative to a High Energy Density Systems (HEDS) Roadmap, which includes future technologies research and development (R&D), demonstrations, production plans, and readiness level timelines for airborne, sea, and land-based military applications in the following energy/power based areas:  Lithium Based Batteries, Other Electrochemical Batteries, Capacitive Storage, Fuel Cells, Advanced Energy Conversion/Power Systems, Packaging/Systemization, Energy Systems Management/Control, Advanced Applications Technology, and Safety/Risk.
Respond to this RFI by submitting one or more white papers as described below and by indicating your willingness to participate in a one-week workshop.
The objective of the project is to produce a strategic roadmap with key technological elements that will communicate the technology options for high energy density systems over a future timeframe.  The roadmap will be a tool for planning highly effective, safe, affordable high energy density systems (HEDS) for Navy systems.  Scope - HEDS used in U.S. Navy systems above the size of personnel-carried systems and below primary propulsion for ships.
Items under consideration in the roadmapping process:	Competitive Position	Pervasive Competencies	Systemic Challenges	Technology, Applications/Capability Timelines	Allied (companion, enabling) Technology Timelines	New knowledge/tradecraft requirements	Risk (including Safety/Heat)	Total Ownership Cost High Level	Dependencies	Drivers	Key Enablers/Impacts	Technology Gaps	Science & Technology Brickwalls	Critical Success Factors/Dependencies	Critical Success Factor Futures	Insights
Information will be technically evaluated by NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, other Navy, DoD, and Government organizations, and some academic and industry participants for the purposes of market research and the development of a HEDS Roadmap.
A HEDS Roadmap workshop is scheduled for 12-16 July 2010 at NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane and in Bloomington, IN.  Respondees to this announcement are asked to indicate their interest in participating in the HEDS Roadmap workshop.  Some respondees from academia and industry may be invited to participate as working group members for this workshop.  
The HEDS Roadmap workshop will be highly technical in nature; marketing and sales pitches will not be allowed.  Participants ideally will be chief engineers/scientists or other similar senior personnel with an orientation toward the energy and power sources expected to be achieved in the next 30 years.  

SAMPLE "WHITE PAPER" RESPONSE OUTLINE
Interested parties shall submit via email an initial synopsis. (commonly referred to as a "white paper")   Offerors should submit all correspondence (white papers, bio, comments) electronically to the NAVSURFWARCENDIV technical point of contact below NLT 2:00 PM EDT 06/18/2010.  Please insert "N00164-10-S-NB16 - HEDS" on all correspondence.
Submit a white paper of one page or less in length that briefly discusses one energy/power technology capability that will be a significant difference maker to the Warfighter at any point between the years 2010 and 2040. For example, if you were to bet on a particular capability that could be in production during that timeframe that provided a highly significant return on investment, what would that capability be and why?  Also suggest potential applications that could incorporate this technology capability.  Respondees are encouraged to submit papers both on conventional capabilities as well as advanced and exotic capabilities.
Respondees may submit separate papers on as many such capabilities as they wish.  Such capabilities do not have to be within the current or planned product line of their employer.  Any technology readiness level may be considered that could result in at least small-scale manufacturing of that product by the year 2040.  
Respondees who wish to be considered for an invitation to participate in the workshop must submit a biography via email.  Invitees will be notified of workshop details.

ATN: SV0004GAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) 
JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition 
1.  Contracting Agency and Activity.   The Department of the Interior, United States Geological Survey (USGS), Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO) plans to contract by means other than full and open competition.  This document sets forth the justification and approval for use of one of the exceptions to full and open competition allowed under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1). 
2.  Nature of Action Being Approved.   The USGS under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) is seeking to improve its ability to collect, process, and analyze information regarding volcanic activity and hazards.  Toward this end, the USGS seeks to upgrade the telemetry at several of the existing Yellowstone GPS stations to support 1 Hz data.  This will be achieved through a purchase order and the proposed awardee, UNAVCO, a non-profit membership-governed consortium, facilitating geoscience research and education using geodesy.  The facility is located in Boulder, Colorado.     The estimated dollar value for this requirement is $60,000.   
3.  Description of Supplies or Services.   The USGS operates the YVO in partnership with the University of Utah and Yellowstone National Park.  One of the primary volcano-monitoring tools used by the USGS is Global Positioning Receivers (GPS), whereby small (cm- to mm-scale) ground movements can be monitored.  At Yellowstone National Park, GPS receivers are owned by both the University of Utah and the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO).  They are not owned by the USGS.  UNAVCO is currently the sole contractor allowed by NSF to operate this equipment, which was authorized through Cooperative Agreement EAR0735156 issued by NSF.  In recent years, maintenance and operation of all GPS receivers, including those formerly operated by the University of Utah, have been taken over by UNAVCO.  The data are transferred to UNAVCO's headquarters in Boulder, CO, where it can be distributed in real-time to the USGS and other groups. 
Under the current telemetry system, data from Yellowstone GPS stations are collected every 15 seconds and sent back to UNAVCO in 1 hour batches.  The upgrade requested through this action will have two effects: (1) data will be collected every second, and (2) these data will be transmitted to the UNACVO facility in Boulder, CO in real-time with minimal delay.  The USGS would then receive the data and process it to measure second-by-second ground movements at Yellowstone for comparison with other data streams (strain, seismic).
The requested telemetry upgrade will improve the USGS capability for making short-term forecasts of potential volcanic hazard. Moreover, the rest of the Volcano Science Center will benefit from a 1 Hz capability at Yellowstone because the deformation there is fairly large and quite dynamic.  This makes Yellowstone an ideal testing environment for a high-rate GPS processing and analysis.  Routinely available 1 Hz data will also benefit other research projects by improving the quality of kinematic GPS measurements used, for example, to track animals or study rapid geologic processes at Yellowstone. Furthermore, the incorporation of 1 Hz data into the standard processing could result in significant improvement to daily solutions because the high rate data can be used to model and partially remove time-varying noise sources such as multi-path.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: The proposed action may be awarded without full and open competition under 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Citation in No. 4.   The National Science Foundation (NSF) has exclusive cooperative agreement with UNAVCO to upgrade GPS receives at YVO. The GPS receivers the USGS seeks to upgrade are owned by NSF.  As outlined in Cooperative Agreement EAR0735156, all of the GPS receivers at YVO are currently operated by UNAVCO on behalf of NSF and the University of Utah.  This Cooperative Agreement was established between NSF and UNAVCO to support the continued management and operation of the UNAVCO GPS and geodetic technology support facility, including the YVO telemetry system.  Theoretically, another contractor could provide a proposal to perform the GPS receiver upgrades; however, UNAVCO would need to be involved in this work with this other contractor because UNAVCO is currently under agreement with NSF and the University of Utah to operate this telemetry system.  UNAVCO personnel would have to be paid on a full-cost recovery basis, as a subcontractor to the successful contractor.  This would be a cost duplication to the Government, as the NSF has already incurred costs, such as permitting for access to the Park, and the USGS would pay again for these same services.  The spirit of the full and open competition process would be circumvented because the USGS would need to inform competing contractors that direct involvement with UNAVCO will be required.  
Most importantly, the GPS receiver sites are in restricted areas of the park and currently, only UNAVCO personnel have permits allowing them to be on-site during all work performed on the telemetry systems.  According to UNAVCO, it took them (redacted) to obtain the necessary permits for these 7 locations throughout the Park.  Each permit cost (redacted), for a total cost of (redacted).  New permits would need to be created for any new vendor, if NSF agreed to allow another contractor to upgrade their equipment.  As in UNACO's case, obtaining such a permit could take many, many months to complete, which would jeopardize successful and timely completion of this ARRA project which is required to be completed by 30 September 2011.  The start date of the project cannot be defined if the successful contractor does not currently maintain a permit to restricted areas of Yellowstone National Park.  Currently, UNAVCO is the only contractor that has a valid permit to work on the telemetry systems at YNP.   

6.  The Efforts to Identify Additional Sources.   Initially, this procurement began as a competitive, open market requirement.  In accordance with open market procedures, both the synopsis (posted from 10 March 2010 through 17 March 2010) and the solicitation (posted from 23 March 2010 through 12 April 2010) were posted at www.FedBizOpps.gov.  While the solicitation was open, an interested party contacted the Contracting Officer (C/O) and requested additional information on the statement of work.  The C/O deferred these questions to the USGS YVO technical liaisons, Peter Cervelli and Jake Lowenstern.   As a result of the questions posed to the technical liaisons, they realized only UNAVCO could provide to the needed permits to conduct the work.  Therefore, an amendment was issued to cancel the solicitation.  The interested party was notified of the cancellation. No party protested the cancellation, and no further requests for additional information about the procurement were received.  
The National Science Foundation was contacted to see if they would be interested in entering into an Interagency Agreement with the USGS for this work, thinking  NSF  could modify their existing Cooperative Agreement with UNAVCO to add this work.  However, NSF could not agree to this Interagency Agreement because their Cooperative Agreement was awarded with non-ARRA funds.  A requirement of Recovery Act funding is that is cannot be commingled with regular appropriated funding.  As a result, the Interagency Agreement was not an option.          
7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer. The anticipated cost to the Government is considered to be fair and reasonable based on the independent government estimate as well as a comparison of similar telemetry upgrade services recently procured.  A comprehensive price analysis will be conducted prior to award.      
8.  Market Research. The Government attempted to obtain competition on this requirement, but could not do so due to the permit issue previously discussed. Market research is considered to be satisfied through the original solicitation (#10WRQQ0148) since it was posted to FBO for all interested vendors to see and provide comment. As noted above, only one company other than UNAVCO provided comment.
9. Other Facts. N/A
10.  Sources Interested in this Acquisition. UNAVCO of Boulder, CO.
11.  Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition.  If the USGS has another requirement to upgrade the telemetry systems at Yellowstone National Park, competition will be sought.  The Contracting Officer will work with the National Science Foundation, the National Park Service at Yellowstone National Park, and all interested parties so that they may obtain the necessary permits and approvals.     
12.  Recommendation and Certification from Program Office. Based on the above, I recommend this acquisition be conducted on the basis of other than full and open competition.  I certify that technical data which form a basis for this justification that are the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel are complete and accurate. 
Signature Redacted _______________________________________			Jacob Lowenstern, Scientist-in-Charge 				Yellowstone Volcano Observatory  
13.  Certifications from the Contracting Officer.   All of the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act, (41 U.S.C. 253), as implemented in the Federal and Interior Acquisition Regulations, have been considered in preparing this justification. This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R & D Maintenance Services, Inc., W91278-09-C-0020, Operation and Maintenance of Government Owned Facilities<br><br>Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-09-C-0020, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway, Columbus, Mississippi, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  The work shall include the repair of the Ring Levee at Mahannah Wildlife Management Area near Vicksburg Mississippi, Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway, Wildlife Mitigation Project.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been added to the basic contract. This existing contract must be used because:   1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to the Mississippi River falling to a level that a complete inspection can be made.   2)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time required to start repairs thus minimizing the impact on the Wildlife Management Area and associated levees. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.  <BR>

The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-08-C-0028, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Alabama River Lakes Project, awarded to Eagle Aviation Services and Technology, Inc., 1801 Robert Fulton Drive STE 450, Reston, Virginia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for in order to complete the upgrading of Gunter Hill Campground, specifically to renovate the existing sewer system, provide sewer service to all camp sites, and pave/re-pave all campground roads and parking lots.  The work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions which includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems in all of the recreation areas.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract.<BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of this recreation area.  2)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>This synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a competitive Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) contract for project 508-336 design/build to convert third (3rd) floor mechanical room into usable administrative and clinical space.  Sufficient competition in the Service Disabled Veteran Owned construction companies was identified, which resulted in this being a 100% set-aside for competitive bids for the project.  No other small business set-asides will be considered for this award.  The VA Medical Center, Atlanta, Georgia intends to award a firm fixed price design/build contract for project 508-336.  The contractor shall provide design build services necessary to furnish all supervision, labor, tools, equipment for demolition, asbestos abatement, and new construction for project 508-336 to covert third (3RD) floor mechanical room to usable administrative space.  All work in accordance to the statement of objectives and attachment 1 specification 00 11 21 shall be completed within 180 Calendar days upon receiving the notice to proceed which is expected to be issued not later than July 19, 2010.

This is a two-step design/build construction project the statement of objectives is provided below:

Overall Objectives:  The third floor of the hospital tower at the Atlanta VA Medical Center was originally constructed as a mechanical room but today many of the original utility systems are no longer active.  An independent study conducted in 2008 indicated that, with selective demolition, hazardous material abatement, removal of inactive systems and possible resizing or relocation of others, the third floor mechanical room is suitable for conversion to typical office or clinical exam space.  A copy of this independent study will be provided upon serious requests of potential contractors that will be submitting technical and cost proposals.  The overall objective of this project is to convert as much of the mechanical room into usable clinical, administrative, and storage space as possible within the identified price range; the end goal is approximately 14,000 ft.  The Statement of Objectives will be placed by the Design-Build Architect-Engineer (DB/AE) Contractor Performance Work Statement (CPWS) accepted by the Government and will be incorporated into the contract document as Attachment #1.

The NAICS Code for this proposed procurement is 236220 and the annual size standard is $33.5 million. This proposed solicitation is an SDVOSB set-aside.  Estimated cost of this potential contract is between $2,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. The Government reserves the right to enter into negotiations or limit the competitive range.  Bid bonds, performance and payment bonds are required. All interested SDVOSB firms must have bonding capability.

Procurement Method: The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical proposal, past performance and experience information, and a price (or cost) proposal for evaluation by the Government.

A site visit is scheduled for Thursday, June 3, 2010 at 1:00 pm and all offerors are encouraged to attend.  Proposals will be due Friday, June 25, 2010 by 2:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Offers must be submitted to Department of Veterans Affairs Attn:  R. Anthony Stephens, 1601 Clairmont Road (508/10N7NLO), Decatur, GA. 30033.  No late offers will be accepted.

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center on Birth and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD), Division of Human Development and Disability (DHDD), Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program collaborates with federal, national, and state agencies and organizations in assisting states and territories to implement EHDI tracking and surveillance systems; assist states in enhancing EHDI infrastructure to improve their capacity to ensure that all infants are screened for hearing loss and receive appropriate follow-up services, as outlined in Goal 28-11 of Healthy People 2010; and maintain an information clearinghouse on issues related to EHDI that will be available through the CDC EHDI web site and teleconferences. Through these functions, the CDC EHDI program strives to ensure that newborns have the opportunity to communicate from birth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This program is a part of continuing national efforts to promote (1) early detection of hearing loss; (2) tracking of infants/children who are deaf or hard of hearing; and (3) the initiation of effective intervention systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These efforts are essential roles of the CDC EHDI program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Part of the CDC EHDI program mission is to support states in the development of tracking and surveillance systems and collect and maintain a database with aggregate hearing screening and follow-up data. Although this aggregate level data has enabled the generation of national estimates of hearing screening, diagnosis and enrollment in intervention, there are several limitations and questions that cannot be addressed with this data, which is why more detailed, pseudonymized, individual data is needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

GOVPAY ELECTRONIC INVOICINGAll payment requests must be submitted electronically through GovPay.  "Payment request" means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment by a contractor. To constitute a proper invoice, the GovPay payment request must conform to the requirements identified in FAR 32.905(b), "Payment Documentation and Process" and FAR 52.232-25, "Prompt Payment (OCT 2008)". To ensure the timely processing of invoices GovPay uses an automated "workflow" process to route invoices for review, approvals and payment; as required by the "Prompt Payment Act". Detailed GovPay information for use of GovPay may be obtained on the Internet at www.govpay.gov.  This web site includes user manuals, training resources, instructions for registration and contact information for the GovPay help desk for additional support.  All users can access reports on the status of their invoices. Supporting documentation shall be attached to the GovPay invoice in the form of "flat files" in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and an Adobe PDF file.  There is a 15MB limitation on file size for these attachments, per header or line item.  Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are NOT acceptable electronic forms for payment requests.   GovPay uses the contractor information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as one of the components for validating contractor registration.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to submit accurate and current CCR information.  Failure to register and maintain CCR information, or if it has expired, been suspended, been deleted, or could not be found, will result in rejection of your invoice.  An invoice submitted during the period for which information in the CCR could not be verified must be resubmitted for payment after successfully registering or updating registration in CCR.  Contractors are encouraged to review their CCR information to ensure the most current information is available for GovPay. The CCR Assistance Center is available to provide assistance and answer questions.  They can be reached at 1-888-227-2423 or on the web at http://www.ccr.gov. [End of clause]

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure general design services for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communication and Public Liaison (OCPL). This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and and is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) under NLM-10-028/SRE. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541430 with a small business standard of $7.0 million.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) is actively involved in responding to the 1987 Congressional mandate "...to develop outreach programs aimed at the transfer of the latest scientific findings to all health professionals...in rural communities and other areas, and, to publicize the availability of its produce and services..." This legislation was prompted, in part, by concern that information on health and biomedical topics be readily and freely available for all populations, in easy-to-understand formats.<br /><br />In response, NLM wishes to engage the services of a Contractor in designing and producing promotional materials to reach health professionals, researchers, populations in rural communities, minorities and the general public. <br /><br />Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to secure the services of a Contractor with demonstrated ability in developing strategic identities and the ability to design, implement and produce printed materials, electronic media materials, Web sites and mount custom exhibits.<br /><br />Scope of Work<br /><br />The task objectives are as follows: <br /><br />BRAND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<br /><br />As a guideline, these steps are needed to develop successful brands and graphic communication materials. <br /><br />Phase 1: Planning<br />During this phase, Contractor meets with client as often as deemed appropriate by both parties, exploring NLM programs, services, audiences, messages, communications goals, etc. A design mission statement, better known as a "creative brief" is developed, outlining and identifying these important points and elements:<br /><br />a. Brand and communication objectives<br />b. Audience demographics<br />c. Current and future communication materials - establish features and formats<br />d. Aesthetic and style considerations<br />e. Competitive or similar brands - references those and conducts a review<br />f. Visual assets <br />g. Creative and other resources<br />h. Responsibilities of client and Contractor<br />i. Schedule<br />j. Establish overall budget and specific costs<br /><br />
<p>Phase 2: Conceptual Development<br />During this phase, several creative solutions are produced that achieve the objectives and establish the tone and aesthetics for the brand. The following materials are created for review by NLM:<br /><br />a. Visual concepts<br />b. Brand messaging/writing samples<br />c. Logo designs<br />d. Proposed Imagery<br />e. Brand artwork<br /><br />After review, revisions are made to finalize the tone, the aesthetic style of the brand and the brand photography and artwork.<br /><br />Phase 3: Design<br />The brand is implemented throughout the communication materials during this phase. As each pre-determined brand component is designed, sketches and comprehensives are produced for review and evaluation by NLM. As the designs are further developed, the result will be graphic standards and templates that establish controls for typography, color, imagery and artwork. Reviews and approvals may take several rounds of revisions to receive NLM's final approval. Production specifications are coordinated for art preparation. Production costs are provided as required.<br /><br />Phase 4: Production<br />Once the design for a brand component has been approved, the design template is finalized and production files that meet the vendor specifications are prepared. The Contractor will source and create all final artwork and maintain a very high level of quality. NLM will review each production file for accuracy and quality. With NLM's approval, those files are released for the item to be produced. As the approval process requires, vendor samples will be reviewed and coordinated.<br /><br />Phase 5: Documentation<br />The brand is documented in a brief manual for future reference during this phase. All design templates are organized for easy reference and future use. The depth and detail of brand documentation will be determined by the brand management procedures NLM can institute and manage. <br />Brand management is often the factor that makes a brand successful or not. Consistent implementation of a brand is its most important aspect. For the sake of the brand, NLM should plan for detailed documentation and an easy system of accessing and archiving templates and artwork.<br /><br />Task 1: Promotional Materials for NLM Outreach<br />To successfully design the items listed below, the Vendor would meet with NLM staff again, for planning. The brand would be implemented throughout the materials specified in this solicitation and across any other materials that NLM requests.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The solicitation number for this requirement is NTSB-R-10-0015. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This requirement is a total small business set-aside. The associated NAICS code is 423830 Industrial Machinery and Equipment Merchant Wholesalers and the small business size standard is 100 employees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong><br />The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent Federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant accidents in the other modes of transportation -- railroad, highway, marine and pipeline -- and issuing safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of Requirement<br /></span></strong>The NTSB has a requirement for the purchase of:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 1: One refurbished self propelled lift truck. The equipment shall be provided in accordance with Attachment 1, the Statement of Work (SOW), which is attached hereto and incorporated herein.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In order for quotes to be evaluated, vendors must submit the specifications for the proposed refurbished self propelled lift truck with their quote. Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer. In order to be technically acceptable, the offer must provide documentation that demonstrates that the proposed equipment meets all of the requirements in this RFQ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Technically acceptable quotes will be ranked in descending order from lowest price to highest price. The equipment of the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, will be inspected at the vendor's location (within the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area) by NTSB staff to evaluate the condition, functionality and suitability of the equipment as described in this RFQ. If the NTSB laboratory staff determines the condition, functionality and suitability of this equipment to be acceptable then award will be made to this vendor. Otherwise, the NTSB staff will evaluate the condition, functionality and suitability of the equipment of next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer until an award is made.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The successful offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award.</p>

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two years (extension optional)<br />7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS, Almaty, Kazakhstan <br />8. JOB DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>A) BACKGROUND</p>
<p>United States Government (USG) The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is providing the largest amount of resources for a single disease in history, and seeks to expand prevention, treatment and care to millions of HIV-affected people worldwide. It employs a multifaceted approach combating HIV/AIDS in more than 100 countries around the world.</p>
<p>The HIV epidemic in Eastern Europe and Central Asian Republics (CAR) is concentrated in a small group of most-at-risk populations (MARP), but is the fastest growing in the world within that sphere. Reported HIV prevalence among the general population is estimated at 0.1% across the region (0.3% in Tajikistan and virtually zero % in Turkmenistan). Of the total 61.3 million residents of the region, an estimated 70,500 individuals are infected with HIV and, to date, a cumulative total of 27,500 AIDS cases have been registered. The region is also a key transit area in global heroin trafficking. The epidemic is fueled mainly by injecting drug users (IDU) concentrated in urban centers and along drug transport corridors from Afghanistan through Tajikistan (TJ), Uzbekistan (UZ), Kyrgyzstan (KG), and Kazakhstan (KZ). The United Nations Organization for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that up to 1% of adults are heroin users, and sentinel surveillance data indicate 70-80% of all drug users are IDU. HIV prevalence rates of IDU range from 4.2% in KZ to 17.6% in Tajikistan. Sentinel surveillance data of IDU found HIV prevalence as high as 34% in parts of UZ. As of 2008, the percentage of HIV infection due to injection drug use was approximately 75% in KZ/KG and approximately 60% in UZ/TJ. While IDU remains a predominate driver of the epidemic, sexual transmission is also playing an increasing role. Based on 2008 data from Ministries of Health (MoH), as much as 29% of HIV infection has been attributed to sexual transmission and this proportion appears to be increasing. Unsafe sex by IDU and their sexual contacts, including sex workers (SW), constitute a key bridge to the general population. With HIV highly concentrated among a small high-risk group, there is still an opportunity to stem the growth of the epidemic to the general population. But partners and governments must act quickly and decisively with interventions focused on stopping transmission within and by key most at risk populations (MARP).</p>
<p>High rates of migration (particularly from TJ, UZ, and KG) to destinations within and outside the region complicate the epidemic. While migrants are considered to be a risk group in the region, few prevalence data are available. TJ, the only country in CAR that reported data in 2008 for migrants, reported 0.5% HIV prevalence for that year. More information is needed to further understand the burden of HIV among migrants.</p>
<p>While the CAR countries are at varying points on the development continuum, all share the challenge of reforming inefficient Soviet-era health care delivery systems into working health systems. Public health expenditures in all five countries are less than 3.3% of GDP, with TJ at 1%. Health systems inherited from Soviet times include vertical structures for HIV, tuberculosis (TB), STI, drug treatment, and blood transfusion services, with little or no coordination between them. Local governments have struggled with varying levels of success to build a truly cross-sectional response to the AIDS epidemic. Adding to this difficulty is the inherent distrust by CAR governments of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the lack of government experience partnering with these new organizations. Stigma surrounding injecting drug use, punitive legislation, and frequent rights violations of individuals within MARP have delayed the adoption of appropriate interventions and continue to restrict the ability of HIV programs to access people in need of services.</p>
<p>The overriding objective of the USG program in Central Asia is to stop the spread of HIV from the highest-risk groups to the general population. To do this, the USG will focus aggressively on expanding service delivery for MARPS including medication assisted therapy (MAT). The program will also provide a package of comprehensive services to IDU, SW, and MSM as the major drivers of the epidemic. The program will partner with MoH and other donors to aggressively scale up evidence-based practices and provide comprehensive prevention services to MARP. The program will assist to improve approaches to recruitment and adherence through active outreach and other means, and improve quality of service delivery (treatment, care, etc) through targeted technical assistance (TA) and training of MoH and NGO staff.</p>
<p>B) BASIC FUNCTION</p>
<p>The incumbent is designated by the five Chiefs of Mission or their designates to serve as their representative and coordinator of activities related to PEPFAR in Central Asia. The Coordinator represents the Chief of Mission (COM) on the PEPFAR Team and carries issues and decisions to the team on his/her behalf. S/he may be called upon to inform decisions by the COM or advise him/her on necessary courses of action when the inter-agency Team is unable to reach consensus. PEPFAR is an inter-agency initiative and it is hoped that the participating agencies will be able to plan and manage the program by consensus. OGAC guidance allows for COM decision making when this is not possible. The Coordinator will meet regularly with the COM in each CAR country or his/her designate and keep him/her up to date in key issues which may require advice or final decision.</p>
<p>The Coordinator is a facilitator, a communicator, and at times, a negotiator. S/he works closely with all USG agencies involved in HIV/AIDS programming in Central Asia and contributes to the five countries' national HIV/AIDS strategies, facilitating a coordinated USG HIV/AIDS response in collaboration with other donor groups and implementing partners in the region. The Coordinator chairs the regional interagency PEPFAR team which is comprised of senior Agency representatives. The role of the regional team is to provide broad policy and strategic direction-including compliance with the guidance and earmarks set by OGAC and assurance of maximal congruence with the priorities of host governments-for implementation of the Emergency Plan in Central Asia.</p>
<p>The Coordinator leads the development, preparation, and submission of all operational plans related to PEPFAR, including performance reports. The Coordinator is responsible for coordinating responses to regular and ad hoc requests from OGAC; for ensuring that reports are submitted to OGAC on time; for organizing the logistical arrangements for inter-agency work; and for keeping agencies on task for inter-agency efforts.</p>
<p>The Coordinator is, in general, not a technical director, although the Coordinator may be expected on occasion to ensure follow-up on implementation of technical recommendations based on the Regional Operational Plan (ROP) and other performance review information.</p>
<p>C) DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>Areas of responsibility for the PEPFAR Coordinator's position include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Communication and Cooperation (35%)<br />- Liaise with OGAC through the respective Country Support Team lead and members named by OGAC; <br />- Liaise with the Ambassador and/or their representative in each country to coordinate Partnership Framework negotiations (if required), and ensure that country USG staff are apprised of key PEPFAR accomplishments, challenges, and timelines;<br />- Liaise with and facilitate communication between named representatives of the USG PEPFAR implementing agencies, (i.e., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the US Agency for International Development (USAID); the Peace Corps; and the Department of Defense) to ensure critical communication between and among agencies, including action requests, and policy guidance from OGAC;<br />- Convene, chair and facilitate meetings, as well as disseminate and retain records of meetings with CAR PEPFAR team, technical working groups and other USG PEPFAR partners;<br />- Mediate interagency and inter-country conflicts that may occur in the planning process;<br />- Oversee, supervise and coordinate with Regional Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) Liaison to ensure USG efforts are integrated with GFATM activities and implementation;<br />- Support representational activities by the following illustrative examples:<br />- With agency input, preparing written materials in collaboration with Public Affairs Offices (PAO), including press releases and Op-Ed materials for local and international media;<br />- With agency input, supporting Congressional visits, PEPFAR Deputy Principal visits, and visits by international dignitaries; and <br />- Coordinate interagency and Washington clearance processes for technical assistance visits (TDY), and promote inter-agency dissemination of information whenever possible and appropriate;</p>
<p>Planning and Implementation (35%)<br />- Facilitate USG strategic planning and consensus on overall technical strategy for annual plans. <br />- Facilitate the development and the implementation of a unified PEPFAR program, which includes the planning and production of the annual regional operational plan (ROP). The ROP must capitalize on the comparative advantages and competencies of participating USG agencies and achieve maximum results related to the PEPFAR 3-12-12 targets and the host governments' National AIDS Programs;<br />- Coordinate and facilitate all reports required by OGAC including semi/annual performance reviews.<br />- Facilitate the submission of all ROP re-programming requests to OGAC.<br />- Facilitate the process of interagency collaboration to develop detailed implementation plans, including country-specific work planning, setting of expected deliverables and monitoring plan.<br />- Support efforts by USG implementing agencies to recruit, qualify, and successfully engage new, especially indigenous, partners in PEPFAR activities.</p>

<p>U.S. Department of Transportation<br />Research Innovative and Technology Administration (RITA) <br />Research, Development and Technology Office, RDT-50<br />1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE <br />Washington, DC 20590</p>
<p>Commercial Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Technologies Program</p>
<p>BAA #: RITA-RS-10-01<br />White Papers Due: 4:15 PM, EDT, July 15, 2010 <br />Program Manager: Caesar Singh, P.E., 202-366-3252, caesar.singh@dot.gov. <br /><br />CONTACT INFORMATION: Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), being issued on behalf of the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is soliciting information and descriptions (White Papers) for activities to validate initiatives in support of the U.S. DOT Commercial Remote Sensing and Spatial Information (CRS&amp;SI) technologies program for transportation infrastructure development and construction. At the level of the PRIME offeror (Applicant), competition is restricted to universities. Proposed SUB-Recipients may, however, be any kind of organization or individual, commercial or otherwise. Interested and eligible offerors may submit separate White Papers on one or more of the focus areas described in this announcement. Each White Paper on each focus area must not exceed fifteen (15) pages, including any appendices and back-up materials and must include the offeror's contact information: point of contact, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address. Separate White Papers must be submitted for each proposed project/focus area and multiple projects/initiatives cannot be combined into a single White Paper.</p>
<p>SCOPE: A four-year CRS&amp;SI technology application program is authorized in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) (PL 109-59) &sect; 5506. SAFETEA-LU authorized $7.75 million annually for funding during fiscal Years 2006 - 2009. In March of 2010 the President signed The Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (HIRE) (PL 111-147) extending SAFETEA-LU surface transportation programs till December 31, 2010 at '09 funding levels. The U.S. DOT Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) manages the CRS&amp;SI program. Because RITA will probably be making multiple Cooperative Agreement awards from this BAA, it is unlikely that any one awardee (i.e., Recipient of a resulting Cooperative Agreement) would receive, in Federal funds, more than a fraction of the allocated funding that is available under this Phase III of the program.</p>
<p>This SAFETEA-LU program focuses on major national initiatives and validation of CRS&amp;SI technology applications which deliver smarter and more efficient methods, processes and services for transportation infrastructure development and construction. The program execution was classified into three two-year phases. This is the third two-year phase (i.e., Phase Three) of the program. The program awards will be competitively selected from individual/consortia teams of university research entities working in partnership with industry and state agencies, and meeting the technical and cost sharing requirements of this announcement.</p>
<p>These focus areas are chosen based on DOT priorities for CRS&amp;SI technology applications for user services that have the potential to produce a high return on investment, in terms of saving cost and improving the efficiency of infrastructure development and construction.</p>
<p>Commercial remote sensing products include remote sensing technologies and data from above-ground platforms - e.g. satellites, aerial vehicles etc. Spatial information technology products include technologies and data from Geospatial Information Systems, Global Positioning Systems and other related services. The proposals should focus on CRS&amp;SI technology products applicable to transportation infrastructure development and construction.</p>
<p>The process of infrastructure development, planning, construction and condition assessment is burdened with challenges of collection and interpretation of data, adoption of innovative methods and timely implementation of new technologies. Therefore, in order to ensure safe and efficient movement of people and freight within the national transportation infrastructure system, this program is soliciting projects dedicated to reduce inefficiencies, improve system performance, and assess infrastructure condition through implementation of applied research. Specific focus areas for infrastructure development, planning, construction and condition assessment include:</p>
<p>&bull; Roadways:- asphalt and concrete construction quality assessment, pavement surface property assessment, pavement health monitoring of existing systems; un-surfaced road evaluation and maintenance<br />&bull; Bridges:- project and network level inspection and evaluation tools/technologies that provide quantitative data for planning, maintenance, and program development<br />&bull; Tunnels:- quantitative inspection and evaluation tools <br />&bull; Pipelines:- detection of system deficiencies and damage prevention<br />&bull; Waterway systems:- infrastructure planning and operations<br />&bull; Highway Facilities:- infrastructure planning and operations<br />&bull; Freight:- infrastructure planning and operations<br />&bull; Public Transportation:- system operations, maintenance and program development<br />&bull; Intelligent Transportation Systems:- infrastructure planning and operations.</p>
<p><br />The proposed approach addressing any of the focus areas shall pursue one or more of the following objectives:</p>
<p>1. Validate the application of CRS&amp;SI technologies to collect data and provide a framework for analysis in studies and projects related to infrastructure development design, planning and construction;</p>
<p>2. Apply advances in space-based technology applications to increase efficiency and safety, reduce congestion and shorten the time required to develop multimodal transportation options;</p>
<p>3. Develop and validate new applications of CRS&amp;SI technologies for reducing construction time and monitoring the quality of infrastructure construction; and</p>
<p>4. Apply CRS&amp;SI technology integration and products to monitor the condition of constructed infrastructure systems and provide quantitative data to eliminate or supplement components of current visual inspection procedures.</p>
<p><br />WHITE PAPERS: RITA is soliciting White Papers that address one or more of the focus areas outlined in this announcement (see above). A proposal must include a cost sharing contribution of at least half (50%), in accordance with SAFETEA-LU Section 5101 (a)(1) and (b), of the proposed project's cost to be considered. In other words, the grand total dollar amount of an Applicant's proposed cost-sharing contribution to the project must be equal to the total dollar amount of the Federal funding sought by the Applicant. Each White Paper must not exceed a total of 15 pages, including any appendices and backup materials and must include sufficient information to determine the probability of achieving the objectives of the focus area and to evaluate the following areas (All evaluation factors are of equal importance):<br /><br />1) Technical concept addressing the focus area;<br />2) Technical approach and plans for validating the concept for transportation application;<br />3) Background of the performing consortia team in related areas of technologies and space based technology application; <br />4) Proposed partnerships between cooperating consortia of university centers, industry and state agencies; and<br />5) Proposed cost and cost sharing contributions to perform the proposed concept.</p>
<p><br />EVALUATION AND SELECTION FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION: Based on evaluation of the responses received, the U.S. DOT may select one or more focus areas for awards and may choose to fund selected areas through Cooperative Agreements. As stated above, half (50%) cost sharing is required from proposing consortia teams to perform the tasks. Cost sharing may include direct, indirect and in-kind cost contributions and can be made collectively from the consortia of university research centers, industry and state agencies. Proposed partnerships and cost sharing arrangements need not be finalized in the White Papers submitted in response to this announcement; but proposed partnerships and cost-sharing arrangements will need to be finalized and presented in detail in any full proposals that RITA may hereafter request from the authors of the best White Papers submitted. The period of performance for completing each project and delivering results must not exceed 24 months. A panel of federal agency experts will review all White Papers received for responsiveness to the areas specified above. Each offeror submitting a White Paper deemed worthy of further consideration and meeting the criteria of this BAA will be notified with possible suggestions for change in scope and detailed guidelines for submitting a full proposal. The Program Manager must give his approval regarding any discussion held between an offeror and the Government's technical staff after submission of a White Paper.</p>
<p><br />GENERAL INFORMATION: In all correspondence, please reference the BAA number. Six hard copies and one electronic copy of each White Paper shall be submitted. Hard copies shall be submitted via overnight delivery system to:</p>
<p>Caesar Singh, P.E.<br />Program Manager<br />Office of Research Development &amp; Technology<br />Research and Innovative Technology Administration<br />U. S. Department of Transportation<br />Room E33-123<br />1200 New Jersey Avenue, S. E.<br />Washington, D. C. 20590 <br />Tel: (202) 366-3252</p>
<p>White Papers must be received in the above office not later than 4:15 PM, EDT, July 15, 2010. Because of continued security concerns, offerors should not send White Papers via regular mail, but should instead use a well-established commercial overnight delivery service, such as, but not necessarily limited to, one of the following (listed in alphabetical order): Federal Express, or United Parcel Service. Electronic copies of the White Paper submission are to be sent to Caesar.singh@dot.gov. All inquiries concerning this announcement shall be directed to Mr. Singh.</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT: This FedBizOps notice constitutes the BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). A formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other type of solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued. At the level of the PRIME Offeror (i.e., prime Applicant) RITA encourages the widest participation by UNIVERSITIES only, as consortium leaders. But at the level of the proposed SUB-Recipient, RITA encourages an even broader participation and involvement, not only by universities and other academic institutions, but also by corporations, non-profit organizations, small and small disadvantaged businesses, State or local governments, and individuals participating in teaming arrangements with the university research centers. White Papers submitted under this BAA will remain property of the Government and will not be returned to the offeror.</p>

<p>This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-10-Q-200032 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>This solicitation documented and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted solicitation.

<p>This requirement is for spare parts for the HH65 USCG Aircraft.</p>
<p>The estimate quantity/parts list is attached in both PDF and Excel to be used to submit your quote.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the offeror(s) proposing the best value to the Government considering technical capability, price, delivery and past performance. It is anticipated that MULTIPLE CONTRACTS will be awarded from this solicitation.

<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems. Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard HH-65 aircraft.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>There are multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) associated with the parts contained within this solicitation. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to a manufacturer, manufacturer's COC, FAA 8130, and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JUNE 2008)</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Factor 1- Technical Capability (based on acceptability of FAA/equivalent certification).<br />2. Factor 2- Price<br />3. Factor 3- Delivery<br />4. Factor 4- Past Performance (based on reference checks and/or historical performance record(s).<br />Technical Capability is the most important evaluation factor. Price is the second most important evaluation factor. Delivery is the third most important evaluation factor. Past Performance is the least important evaluation factor. The closer the offers are to equality, price becomes the most important.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

Destination (Nov 1991)<br />52.242-13 Bankruptcy (Jul 1995)<br />FULL TEXT CLAUSES<br />52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. <br />CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ] , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are / are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have [ ] have not [ ] within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)<br />52.209-7 Information Regarding Responsibility Matters. <br />INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) <br />(a) Definitions.

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert "None" if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert &lsquo;None'."] <br />(2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.).

(If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert &lsquo;None')."] <br />(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. <br />(3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. <br />(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): <br />(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; <br />(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment- <br />(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); <br />(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures; <br />(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and <br />(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. <br />(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost- <br />(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and <br />(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. <br />(5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall -<br />(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the -<br />(A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);<br />(B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable;<br />(C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and<br />(D) Contractor point of contact.<br />(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.<br />(6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid.<br />(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.<br />(iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Office will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if -<br />(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner;<br />(B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or<br />(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2).<br />(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment.<br />(v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:<br />(A) The date fixed under this contract.<br />(B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including a demand for payment resulting from a default termination.<br />(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on -<br />(A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor;<br />(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or<br />(C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.<br />(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.<br />(viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion invoice" and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.<br />(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. <br />(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. <br />(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. <br />(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. <br />(8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. <br />(9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. <br />(10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. <br />(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>PROCUREMENT OF TOOL CART
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5 as applicable, as supplemented with additional information included in this solicitation. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
The solicitation number is M67001-10-Q-0165, and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41. This acquisition is unrestricted. The associated NAICS Code for this acquisition is 332439 (size standard of 500 employees). All interested contractors may respond.
The following Contract Line Item Number, with quantities, apply:
CLIN 0001    35 each       $_________________________Tool Cart, Armstrong Tools Model No. MCAT09000, Brand Name of Equal.
Terms: FOB DestinationInspection & Acceptance: Destination
The Marine Corps has a new General Mechanics Tool Kit (GMTK) being issued to Marine Mechanics who perform maintenance on vehicles (trucks, armor vehicles, construction equipment, etc) and other utilities type equipment.  This new GMTK is contained in a Pelican Model 0450/Armstrong Tools Part No. 16-636 Tool Chest and weighs approximately 120 pounds.  The Marine Corps has a requirement for an associated Tool Cart/Roll Cart to be utilized with this new GMTK in a garrison shop environment.
The salient characteristics of the Tool Cart are as follows:
.	The tool cart shall be manufactured from 14 gage steel or greater.  Rolled or rounded edges are required on the top and side panels.  The main body of the cart shall be powered coated in a black color.  All detachable components shall be zinc plated, galvanized or painted in a black color.  The main body of the cart, with no attachments, shall have a maximum width of 32 inches and a maximum depth of 26 inches.  The main body of the cart, with wheels attached, shall have a maximum height of 42 inches.
.	The tool cart shall be constructed with a flat surface so that the GMTK can be placed on or sit in this location or so the surface can be used as a work platform.  The top dimensions shall be at least the same dimension of the GMTK in the front & back (when in the closed configuration).  The top dimensions shall be at least 3 inches beyond the sides of the GMTK in order to have space to place small parts/items.  Slight indentures (in these side areas) are allowed to the surface in order to hold small parts and keep them from rolling or moving across the top surface.
.	The top of the Tool Cart shall include the ability to mount/connect the GMTK (utilizing Pelican Model 0450/Armstrong Tools Part No. 16-636 Tool Chest features) to the top of the Tool Cart to prevent displacement of the GMTK when the cart is tilted and secured at a 20 degree angle.  This includes an orientation (facing downward) in any of the front, rear, left or right directions.  Note metal/plastic brackets and/or elastic straps can be used to mount/connect the GMTK to the top of the cart.  Small holes in the top surface are allowed for removable brackets, as required, but the brackets must be installable/removable without additional nuts/bolts/clips or separate material.  This mounting/connecting technique shall also prevent any displacement of the GMTK, on the surface of the Tool Cart, when the cart is moving at 5 MPH and comes to a sudden stop, while remaining in an upright position.
.	The base (bottom) of the Tool Cart shall extend outward at least 3 inches in the front of the cart to give it a wider base, as compared to the top of the cart, in order to prevent tipping when the GMTK drawers are all in the open/extended position.  The Tool Cart shall not tip forward when all the GMTK drawers are in the open/extended position.
.	Four (4) 8 inch semi-pneumatic wheels (two fixed and two swivel) with a combined total 1000 pound load rating shall be included.  The two swivel wheels shall include foot lever braking/locking devices to prevent the swivel wheels from rolling.  The wheels shall be designed so that the user can install or move the wheels to different wheel mounting locations of his choice (i.e. left or right locations) on the bottom of the Tool Cart.  Both swivel wheels must be mounted on the same side, left or right, not front or back.
.	Two (2) slide drawers, extending almost the width and length of the Tool Cart, and opening from the front of the Tool Cart shall be provided.  The top drawer shall be at least one inch in depth and the other drawer shall be a least two inches in depth.  The drawers shall utilize roller bearing slides.  The drawers shall be able to be locked with a single padlock and inaccessible to an individual without tools.  Both drawers shall be capable of holding 70 lbs within each drawer.  The top drawer, when open, shall also provide a base for the front GMTK door when opened at a slight downward angle to allow the opening of the bottom GMTK tool drawer.  The front GMTK door will then be able to be used as a small work area not to exceed a downward force greater than the 70 lb capability of the top drawer.  The cart shall be designed to provide the ability to add an optional third drawer, with at least a 2 inch depth, without modification.
.	The base of the Tool Cart shall allow for the placement/storage of the GMTK in this location.  It shall include a slight lip (of at least  inch and not more than 1.5 inches) to keep the GMTK or other heavy items from sliding off of the base when cart is tilted and secured at a 20 degree angle.  It shall include a drain hole with removable plug.
.	The Tool Cart shall include a push handle at least 12 inches in width.  This handle shall be mountable/installable at either the left or right top side of the cart.  The user can decide which side it will mount to, so mounting holes shall be included on both side panels.
.	The Tool Cart shall include a foldable shelf at least 12x12 inches.  This shelf shall be mountable/installable at either the left or right upper side of the cart.  The user can decide which side it will be mounted to so mounting holes shall be on both side panels.  The shelf shall be able to hold up to 50 lbs.  When folded in the down position the shelf shall not extend more than 2 inches from the side panel.
.	The Tool Cart shall include all mounting/assembly hardware necessary to assemble the Tool Cart, handle, folding shelf and drawers.  Any tools required for assembly shall be limited to tools included in the GMTK.  The mounting holes on the side panels (for handle & shelf) shall be threaded (tapped) to accept mounting bolts.
.	The side panels shall include small openings in the metal, in the lower half of the panels.  This is to allow the use of cargo bungee cords to hold items in or on the base of the Tool Cart.
A metal Data Plate shall be affixed to one side (outside) of the Tool Cart and have the following information:

<p>The Government will award a contract, pending availability of funds, resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. We are using the lowest price technically acceptable method of source selection. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(1) TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY<br />(2) PRICE</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability and Price, when combined, are EQUAL. However, quotes which are not rated as Technically Acceptable will be eliminated from the competition and receive no further consideration.</p>
<p>(1) All proposals timely received will be evaluated and an award, pending availability of funds, will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsible offeror who responds to all items included in the solicitation (all or none) and complies with the terms of the Request for Quote (RFQ).<br />(2) These are the technical areas that we will evaluate to determine the technical acceptability:<br />a. Reasonableness of proposed schedule. The Air Force estimates a period of performance between 6 and 12 months from Notice to Proceed.<br />b. Company's three year history of similar projects, including whether any Notices of Violation were received. Receipt of any Notice of Violations will not alone disqualify quotes.<br />c. Demonstration of the company's capabilities to manage and perform multiple (5-7) ongoing projects.<br />d. Submittal of a valid Bondability Letter from a Department of Treasury approved Bonding Agency covering the total offered price.<br />(3) The offers will be evaluated by key government personnel, who are expert in their respective disciplines, rating the aforementioned technical areas on a pass or fail basis.

What 3rd party tools are utilized for the current release of CCCBF, and are there already-identified enhancement requests for the CCCBF which would require modernization of the existing system's platform or 3rd party tools? Currently the system uses Crystal Reports v10.0.3300.0, activePDF Toolkit Professional v3.52.6.5083, Microsoft Excel 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2003, SQP server 2005, WebPanelBar v4.0.95.1, WebMenuBar v5.0.95.1, WebGrid v3.1.4700.9, WebCombo v2.0.2500.15, GraphChart v3.0.100.0, TreeView v3.0.4354.3, Peter's Date Package v1.1.7.5000, Microsoft Visual Studio 2003, Infragistics UltraWebGrid v8 vol 2, Infragistics UltraWebNavigator v8 vol 2 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2008.<br />30. Page 9 of the RFP states that the overriding objective is to obtain the best fully operational Web-based solution that meets the functionality of the CCCBF system as outlined in the Requirements documents. Is the CCCBF system currently web-based, and can the Requirements documents mentioned here be made available for review? The CCCBF system is currently a Web-Base application.<br />31. There is no mention as to the residence of the test and production environments for CCCBF. Is the offeror expected to provide any hosting services of either the test, production (or both) environments to execute this contract? No.<br />32. Does the USDA own the currently used 3rd party tools, or if they are owned by the incumbent, are the licenses transferable? If not, may our proposals include an acquisition cost for these items or may we assume USDA will acquire licenses for use in support of this procurement?

Within 1 hour, or more? Will remote/VPN access be possible (this relates to other questions regarding offeror hosting of the software) during non-business hours? How many 24/7 days to the sessions represent? During other times may we assume that support is Monday-Friday during normal business hours? What will be the notification mechanism during 24/7 support and normal business hours support? During the 24/7 support response time should be within an hour. Remote/VPN will not be possible due to current USDA security policies. Notification could be by email or a phone call to the contractor.<br />34. What is the anticipated start date for this project -- that is, what the anticipated date of award? For pricing purposes, please estimate award date as June 14th.<br />35. Section H.4 seems to imply that the incumbent is precluded from bidding in that an offeror selected for contract award does not have an advantage arising from previous performance on this contract. Is this correct? A contractor would only be precluded from bidding on this contract if there is an organizational conflict of interest. This clause and does not imply that the incumbent is precluded.<br />36. There is no mention as to the residence of the test and production environments for CCCBF. Is the offeror expected to provide any hosting services of either the test, production (or both) environments to execute this contract? Same as question 31.<br />37. What weights do each of the evaluation criteria carry in the overall evaluation (section M.1.1)? On page 51, M.1 appears to be numbered incorrectly for the section entitled 'Evaluation (Descending order of Importance). In accordance with Section M.2 Basis for Award - "The Technical Factor is more important than the Past Performance Factor and, when combined, they are both significantly more important than Price." To this end, in this section under 'Corporate Past Performance' what is meant by the statement: "The contractor must demonstrate in the proposal the use of state-of-the-art computer applications and technology and have its own facilities in which to work"? Yes, the Contractor must demonstrate this in the proposal.<br />38. Section H.1.3 suggests that all work will be performed on-site since it states that 'Contractor furnished property is not required for the performance of this contract'. If in fact work is to take place at the Contractor site, may this clause be deleted? This clause is stating that "Contractor furnished property is not required for the performance of this contract". It does not address location. <br />39. If not, then may we interpret Section F.4 to imply 'Customer site' is at USDA offices? The reference in F.4 is incorrect. "Primarily Customer site" should read "Primarily Contractor Site". In section F.4 on page 14, the Place of Performance is listed as the 'Customer Site'. Does USDA mean the 'Contractor Site'? The reference in F.4 is incorrect. "Primarily Customer site" should read "Primarily Contractor Site".<br />40. In section F.4 is the intent to demonstrate an offeror's ability to execute this contract at its own facilities? If so, does this imply that work will NOT be on USDA premises? The reference in F.4 is incorrect. "Primarily Customer site" should read "Primarily Contractor Site". Similarly, Section H.1.3 suggests that all work will be performed on-site since it states that 'Contractor furnished property is not required for the performance of this contract'. If in fact work is to take place at the Contractor site, may this clause be deleted? If not, then may we interpret Section F.4 to imply 'Customer site' is at USDA offices? The reference in F.4 is incorrect. "Primarily Customer site" should read "Primarily Contractor Site".<br />41. The procurement provides for several forms that must be filled out as part of the solicitation, including the Past Performance Questionnaire. Instructions on this last questionnaire suggest that it is a PDF document that may be filled and then eMailed to USDA by an evaluator. However, the solicitation appears as a scanned PDF and the forms are unfillable. Will USDA provide these forms or may we transcribe them to Microsoft Word, fill them out and send them to our evaluators so that they then may be sent to USDA? Yes.<br />42. On page 52 a reference is made to Attachment C, which appears to be the non-disclosure acknowledgement. Does the statement hear mean Attachment D (Past Performance Questionnaire)? Yes, this should read Attachment D.<br />43. On Page 50 under 'Past Performance Volume', is the intent to reference the Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment D) and NOT the Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire (which does not appear as part of this solicitation)? Yes, this should be Past Performance Questionnaire.<br />44. In Attachment D - Past Performance Questionnaire, mention is made in its instructions to question 1.12A, but no question appears to be so captioned. May we assume that 1.12A may be struck? Yes. May we further presume that the questions appearing below 1.11 are in the originally planned questions 1.12B and C? This is intended to reference: "The answers for section 1, questions 1.1-1.11 have been pre-populated by the contractor." only. <br />45. On page 10, Section C.11 appears to be missing completely. Is this a numbering error? Yes.<br />46. On page 10, Section C.12, a reference is made to 'supporting documents'. These were not posted on FedBizOps. Will these documents be made available or should this section be disregarded? Support documentation will be provided.<br />47. While we have identified the locations of several referenced sections and attachments, we appear to be missing Figures 1 and 2. May we have these? We were unable to find the reference to Figure 1. Figure 2 is actually Attachment "ATTACHMENT B - QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP) SECTION 2.2". <br />48. Section A (form 1449) appears to be missing from the solicitation. Per FAR Subpart 12.6, when using the combined synopsis/solicitation procedure, the SF 1449 is not used for issuing the Solicitation.<br />49. Section E.4: A reference is made to the Foreign Agricultural Service as the point of inspection and acceptance. Is this a typographical error? Yes, this reference is incorrect. it should be:</p>
<p>(a) The Contracting Officer or the Contracting Officer's duly authorized representative may inspect and accept the supplies and/or services to be provided under this contract. <br />(b) Inspection and Acceptance will be performed at: <br />U. S. Department of Agriculture<br />Farm Service Agency <br />1400 Independence Avenue, SW<br />Mail Stop 1064 <br />Washington, DC 20250<br />ATTN: Billy Rowland</p>
<p>50. Section H.4.2 (b) and H.5 -- a reference is made to FAS (Foreign Agricultural Service). Is this a typographical error since this procurement does not appear to fall under FAS? This reference is incorrect. It should be: "Farm Service Agency (FSA)".</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure general design services for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communication and Public Liaison (OCPL). This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and and is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) under NLM-10-028/SRE. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541430 with a small business standard of $7.0 million.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) is actively involved in responding to the 1987 Congressional mandate "...to develop outreach programs aimed at the transfer of the latest scientific findings to all health professionals...in rural communities and other areas, and, to publicize the availability of its produce and services..." This legislation was prompted, in part, by concern that information on health and biomedical topics be readily and freely available for all populations, in easy-to-understand formats.<br /><br />In response, NLM wishes to engage the services of a Contractor in designing and producing promotional materials to reach health professionals, researchers, populations in rural communities, minorities and the general public. <br /><br />Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to secure the services of a Contractor with demonstrated ability in developing strategic identities and the ability to design, implement and produce printed materials, electronic media materials, Web sites and mount custom exhibits.<br /><br />Scope of Work<br /><br />The task objectives are as follows: <br /><br />BRAND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<br /><br />As a guideline, these steps are needed to develop successful brands and graphic communication materials. <br /><br />Phase 1: Planning<br />During this phase, Contractor meets with client as often as deemed appropriate by both parties, exploring NLM programs, services, audiences, messages, communications goals, etc. A design mission statement, better known as a "creative brief" is developed, outlining and identifying these important points and elements:<br /><br />a. Brand and communication objectives<br />b. Audience demographics<br />c. Current and future communication materials - establish features and formats<br />d. Aesthetic and style considerations<br />e. Competitive or similar brands - references those and conducts a review<br />f. Visual assets <br />g. Creative and other resources<br />h. Responsibilities of client and Contractor<br />i. Schedule<br />j. Establish overall budget and specific costs<br /><br />
<p>Phase 2: Conceptual Development<br />During this phase, several creative solutions are produced that achieve the objectives and establish the tone and aesthetics for the brand. The following materials are created for review by NLM:<br /><br />a. Visual concepts<br />b. Brand messaging/writing samples<br />c. Logo designs<br />d. Proposed Imagery<br />e. Brand artwork<br /><br />After review, revisions are made to finalize the tone, the aesthetic style of the brand and the brand photography and artwork.<br /><br />Phase 3: Design<br />The brand is implemented throughout the communication materials during this phase. As each pre-determined brand component is designed, sketches and comprehensives are produced for review and evaluation by NLM. As the designs are further developed, the result will be graphic standards and templates that establish controls for typography, color, imagery and artwork. Reviews and approvals may take several rounds of revisions to receive NLM's final approval. Production specifications are coordinated for art preparation. Production costs are provided as required.<br /><br />Phase 4: Production<br />Once the design for a brand component has been approved, the design template is finalized and production files that meet the vendor specifications are prepared. The Contractor will source and create all final artwork and maintain a very high level of quality. NLM will review each production file for accuracy and quality. With NLM's approval, those files are released for the item to be produced. As the approval process requires, vendor samples will be reviewed and coordinated.<br /><br />Phase 5: Documentation<br />The brand is documented in a brief manual for future reference during this phase. All design templates are organized for easy reference and future use. The depth and detail of brand documentation will be determined by the brand management procedures NLM can institute and manage. <br />Brand management is often the factor that makes a brand successful or not. Consistent implementation of a brand is its most important aspect. For the sake of the brand, NLM should plan for detailed documentation and an easy system of accessing and archiving templates and artwork.<br /><br />Task 1: Promotional Materials for NLM Outreach<br />To successfully design the items listed below, the Vendor would meet with NLM staff again, for planning. The brand would be implemented throughout the materials specified in this solicitation and across any other materials that NLM requests. As design progresses, brand standards and templates are established for consistent brand application.<br /><br />Once design for specific promotional materials has been approved, production files are prepared and art files coordinated with prospective vendors or government agencies.<br /><br />As required, the standards and templates would be documented and the files organized for easy access.<br /><br />With more detailed information, Vendor can address the specific project requirements. The Vendor should demonstrate the ability to produce printed materials, such as: <br /><br />a. brochures, including capabilities brochures<br />b. event kits <br />c. press kits <br />d. newsletters<br />e. stationery<br />f. direct mail <br />g. event invitations<br />h. packaging displays<br />i. special items in preparation for NLM's 175th anniversary (in 2011)<br />j. other specialty items, as determined by COTR<br /><br />Task 2: Web Site Design<br />Presence on the World Wide Web is critical to communications and outreach for the National Library of Medicine. Vendor will work with COTR and other NLM staff to create messages, text and images for sections of the NLM Web site, and for other online products, perhaps to include electronic newsletter, NLM Newsroom, and other online products. Vendor will also handle all technical requirements, including the content management system, content development cycles and interactive features of the sites. Wire frames and user flows would be provided. Vendor may also interface with NLM Web experts, as directed by COTR.<br /><br />Vendor will centrally manage each of the Library's projects, placing the Vendor at the center of all activities. The COTR will serve as the liaison between NLM and the creative team or any other third parties, when communication and contact are necessary. Access to the Contractor is, within reason, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, via mobile phone and e-mail device.<br /><br />Vendor will manage multiple phases and tasks, controlling and monitoring workflow while maintaining a high level of service. The Vendor will use efficient technology and delivery services to coordinate information and materials to all project personnel, tracking items electronically and documenting them in spreadsheets, to identify critical relationships, deliverables and dates.<br /><br />At the outset of each project, the Contractor will meet with NLM to establish processes, scope of work, deliverables, responsibilities, critical paths and dependencies, schedules and budgets. As projects progress, the Contractor will issue progress reports indicating the status of work accomplished, work in progress, deliverables pending, schedules, budgets and interdependencies. During those briefings and as the project requires, the Contractor will inform NLM of any modifications to the project requirements and mediate any unforeseen issues. Foremost, the Contractor will act on behalf of NLM to ensure that the project is successful and is completed on time and on budget.<br /><br />To manage budgets, the Contractor will keep track of each line item's estimates for each task costs and in a master contract spreadsheet. This enables NLM to see how the budgets are portioned and realign funds as needed.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.5, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure general design services for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communication and Public Liaison (OCPL). This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and and is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) under NLM-10-028/SRE. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541430 with a small business standard of $7.0 million.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) is actively involved in responding to the 1987 Congressional mandate "...to develop outreach programs aimed at the transfer of the latest scientific findings to all health professionals...in rural communities and other areas, and, to publicize the availability of its produce and services..." This legislation was prompted, in part, by concern that information on health and biomedical topics be readily and freely available for all populations, in easy-to-understand formats.<br /><br />In response, NLM wishes to engage the services of a Contractor in designing and producing promotional materials to reach health professionals, researchers, populations in rural communities, minorities and the general public. <br /><br />Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to secure the services of a Contractor with demonstrated ability to design, implement and produce printed materials, electronic media materials, Web sites and mount custom exhibits.<br /><br />Scope of Work<br /><br />The task objectives are as follows: <br /><br />BRAND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<br /><br />As a guideline, these steps are needed to develop successful brands and graphic communication materials. <br /><br />Phase 1: Planning<br />During this phase, Contractor meets with client as often as deemed appropriate by both parties, exploring NLM programs, services, audiences, messages, communications goals, etc. A design mission statement, better known as a "creative brief" is developed, outlining and identifying these important points and elements:<br /><br />a. Brand and communication objectives<br />b. Audience demographics<br />c. Current and future communication materials - establish features and formats<br />d. Aesthetic and style considerations<br />e. Competitive or similar brands - references those and conducts a review<br />f. Visual assets <br />g. Creative and other resources<br />h. Responsibilities of client and Contractor<br />i. Schedule<br />j. Establish overall budget and specific costs<br /><br />
<p>Phase 2: Conceptual Development<br />During this phase, several creative solutions are produced that achieve the objectives and establish the tone and aesthetics for the brand. The following materials are created for review by NLM:<br /><br />a. Visual concepts<br />b. Brand messaging/writing samples<br />c. Logo designs<br />d. Proposed Imagery<br />e. Brand artwork<br /><br />After review, revisions are made to finalize the tone, the aesthetic style of the brand and the brand photography and artwork.<br /><br />Phase 3: Design<br />The brand is implemented throughout the communication materials during this phase. As each pre-determined brand component is designed, sketches and comprehensives are produced for review and evaluation by NLM. As the designs are further developed, the result will be graphic standards and templates that establish controls for typography, color, imagery and artwork. Reviews and approvals may take several rounds of revisions to receive NLM's final approval. Production specifications are coordinated for art preparation. Production costs are provided as required.<br /><br />Phase 4: Production<br />Once the design for a brand component has been approved, the design template is finalized and production files that meet the vendor specifications are prepared. The Contractor will source and create all final artwork and maintain a very high level of quality. NLM will review each production file for accuracy and quality. With NLM's approval, those files are released for the item to be produced. As the approval process requires, vendor samples will be reviewed and coordinated.<br /><br />Phase 5: Documentation<br />The brand is documented in a brief manual for future reference during this phase. All design templates are organized for easy reference and future use. The depth and detail of brand documentation will be determined by the brand management procedures NLM can institute and manage. <br />Brand management is often the factor that makes a brand successful or not. Consistent implementation of a brand is its most important aspect. For the sake of the brand, NLM should plan for detailed documentation and an easy system of accessing and archiving templates and artwork.<br /><br />Task 1: Promotional Materials for NLM Outreach<br />To successfully design the items listed below, the Vendor would meet with NLM staff again, for planning. The brand would be implemented throughout the materials specified in this solicitation and across any other materials that NLM requests. As design progresses, brand standards and templates are established for consistent brand application.<br /><br />Once design for specific promotional materials has been approved, production files are prepared and art files coordinated with prospective vendors or government agencies.<br /><br />As required, the standards and templates would be documented and the files organized for easy access.<br /><br />With more detailed information, Vendor can address the specific project requirements. The Vendor should demonstrate the ability to produce printed materials, such as: <br /><br />a. brochures, including capabilities brochures<br />b. event kits <br />c. press kits <br />d. newsletters<br />e. stationery<br />f. direct mail <br />g. event invitations<br />h. packaging displays<br />i. special items in preparation for NLM's 175th anniversary (in 2011)<br />j. other specialty items, as determined by COTR<br /><br />Task 2: Web Site Design<br />Presence on the World Wide Web is critical to communications and outreach for the National Library of Medicine. Vendor will work with COTR and other NLM staff to create messages, text and images for sections of the NLM Web site, and for other online products, perhaps to include electronic newsletter, NLM Newsroom, and other online products. Vendor will also handle all technical requirements, including the content management system, content development cycles and interactive features of the sites. Wire frames and user flows would be provided. Vendor may also interface with NLM Web experts, as directed by COTR.<br /><br />Vendor will centrally manage each of the Library's projects, placing the Vendor at the center of all activities. The COTR will serve as the liaison between NLM and the creative team or any other third parties, when communication and contact are necessary. Access to the Contractor is, within reason, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, via mobile phone and e-mail device.<br /><br />Vendor will manage multiple phases and tasks, controlling and monitoring workflow while maintaining a high level of service. The Vendor will use efficient technology and delivery services to coordinate information and materials to all project personnel, tracking items electronically and documenting them in spreadsheets, to identify critical relationships, deliverables and dates.<br /><br />At the outset of each project, the Contractor will meet with NLM to establish processes, scope of work, deliverables, responsibilities, critical paths and dependencies, schedules and budgets. As projects progress, the Contractor will issue progress reports indicating the status of work accomplished, work in progress, deliverables pending, schedules, budgets and interdependencies. During those briefings and as the project requires, the Contractor will inform NLM of any modifications to the project requirements and mediate any unforeseen issues. Foremost, the Contractor will act on behalf of NLM to ensure that the project is successful and is completed on time and on budget.<br /><br />To manage budgets, the Contractor will keep track of each line item's estimates for each task costs and in a master contract spreadsheet. This enables NLM to see how the budgets are portioned and realign funds as needed. Project estimates with further project cost detail are provided as tasks are required.<br /><br />For each task, estimates and a creative brief with a project plan is submitted to the client. Before works commences we obtain the approval of the COTR to the estimate and creative brief.

As the designs are further developed, the result will be graphic standards and templates that establish controls for typography, color, imagery and artwork. Reviews and approvals may take several rounds of revisions to receive NLM's final approval. Production specifications are coordinated for art preparation. Production costs are provided as required.<br /><br />Phase 4: Production<br />Once the design for a brand component has been approved, the design template is finalized and production files that meet the vendor specifications are prepared. The Contractor will source and create all final artwork and maintain a very high level of quality. NLM will review each production file for accuracy and quality. With NLM's approval, those files are released for the item to be produced. As the approval process requires, vendor samples will be reviewed and coordinated.<br /><br />Phase 5: Documentation<br />The brand is documented in a brief manual for future reference during this phase. All design templates are organized for easy reference and future use. The depth and detail of brand documentation will be determined by the brand management procedures NLM can institute and manage. <br />Brand management is often the factor that makes a brand successful or not. Consistent implementation of a brand is its most important aspect. For the sake of the brand, NLM should plan for detailed documentation and an easy system of accessing and archiving templates and artwork.<br /><br />Task 1: Promotional Materials for NLM Outreach<br />To successfully design the items listed below, the Vendor would meet with NLM staff again, for planning. The brand would be implemented throughout the materials specified in this solicitation and across any other materials that NLM requests. As design progresses, brand standards and templates are established for consistent brand application.<br /><br />Once design for specific promotional materials has been approved, production files are prepared and art files coordinated with prospective vendors or government agencies.<br /><br />As required, the standards and templates would be documented and the files organized for easy access.<br /><br />With more detailed information, Vendor can address the specific project requirements. The Vendor should demonstrate the ability to produce printed materials, such as: <br /><br />a. brochures, including capabilities brochures<br />b. event kits <br />c. press kits <br />d. newsletters<br />e. stationery<br />f. direct mail <br />g. event invitations<br />h. packaging displays<br />i. special items in preparation for NLM's 175th anniversary (in 2011)<br />j. other specialty items, as determined by COTR<br /><br />Task 2: Web Site Design<br />Presence on the World Wide Web is critical to communications and outreach for the National Library of Medicine. Vendor will work with COTR and other NLM staff to create messages, text and images for sections of the NLM Web site, and for other online products, perhaps to include electronic newsletter, NLM Newsroom, and other online products. Vendor will also handle all technical requirements, including the content management system, content development cycles and interactive features of the sites. Wire frames and user flows would be provided. Vendor may also interface with NLM Web experts, as directed by COTR.<br /><br />Vendor will centrally manage each of the Library's projects, placing the Vendor at the center of all activities. The COTR will serve as the liaison between NLM and the creative team or any other third parties, when communication and contact are necessary. Access to the Contractor is, within reason, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, via mobile phone and e-mail device.<br /><br />Vendor will manage multiple phases and tasks, controlling and monitoring workflow while maintaining a high level of service. The Vendor will use efficient technology and delivery services to coordinate information and materials to all project personnel, tracking items electronically and documenting them in spreadsheets, to identify critical relationships, deliverables and dates.<br /><br />At the outset of each project, the Contractor will meet with NLM to establish processes, scope of work, deliverables, responsibilities, critical paths and dependencies, schedules and budgets. As projects progress, the Contractor will issue progress reports indicating the status of work accomplished, work in progress, deliverables pending, schedules, budgets and interdependencies. During those briefings and as the project requires, the Contractor will inform NLM of any modifications to the project requirements and mediate any unforeseen issues. Foremost, the Contractor will act on behalf of NLM to ensure that the project is successful and is completed on time and on budget.<br /><br />To manage budgets, the Contractor will keep track of each line item's estimates for each task costs and in a master contract spreadsheet. This enables NLM to see how the budgets are portioned and realign funds as needed. Project estimates with further project cost detail are provided as tasks are required.<br /><br />For each task, estimates and a creative brief with a project plan is submitted to the client. Before works commences we obtain the approval of the COTR to the estimate and creative brief. As the project progresses, Contractor will seek notices to proceed from the COTR with each deliverable and milestone.<br /><br />Deliverables<br /><br />Contractor will design and produce a number of promotional materials, including, but not limited to: (1) designing and/or updating promotional materials, as listed above; and (2) designing and/or updating Web sites.

Question 3:  What types of Clinical Research Projects are the nurses undertaking?  Answer 3:  Animal research involving extremity compartment syndrome and retrospective studies involving casualties from OEF/OIF.

The nurses will be able to take the CITI training after starting their work at USAISR (at Fort Sam Houston, TX).  Question 5:  Para 1.7.2 States the nurse must communicate with scientist and staff in the English and Spanish language.

Correct me if I am wrong, but a favorable NAC cannot be processed until award is made and offers are extended to the candidates that are to be included in the proposal, which may not be possible to be completed by the 7 June start date.  If this is correct, once award is made, the process will begin at this point.  Correct?  Answer 18:  You are correct.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining the NAC for the candidates.

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance</p>
<p>The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price quotes for commercial aircraft component repair services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation with estimated repair cost Not-to-Exceed quotes may be submitted for consideration. THIS IS AN URGENT SLCS (Stock Level Critical Status) REQUIREMENT. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to repair or overhaul of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-10-Q-100038 is assigned for tracking purposes only. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Regulations. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a repair purchase order to the Original Equipment Manufacturer or a legally authorized FAA approved capable repair affiliate. Responsible Vendors may offer a quote for consideration. Firm-Fixed-Price quotes will be evaluated based on a low cost technically acceptable basis. Any Not-To-Exceed quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a Not-To-Exceed proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical repair cost. Quantities provided are estimated quantities. Failure of the government to purchase services for any of the line items in the amounts or quantities described in the schedule of supplies/services will not entitle the contractor to any equitable adjustment in price.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>The United States Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) in coordination with the United States Air Force 498 Nuclear System Group intends to issue a contract, FA9422-10-C-0002, to acquire Modified BBU-63/B Bomb Ejection Impulse Cartridges. This contract will provide technical and analytical expertise to produce Modified BBU-63/B Bomb Ejection Impulse Cartridges for BRU-44B/A Ejection Rack testing.</p>
<p>Based on the Ogden Air Logistics Center AMC/AMSC Screening Analysis Worksheet Report, the only approved source of supply listed is, Scot Inc. AFNWC/PKE and the 498 NSG program office concluded that only Scot Inc. possesses the manning, capability, and experience necessary to effectively provide 498 NSG with proper modification of the BBU-63/B cartridges. Scot, Inc. is also the manufacturer of the&nbsp;BBU-63/B cartridges in current Air Force inventory.</p>
<p>AFNWC/PKE intends to award a contract on a sole source basis under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (a) (2) (ii) to Scot Inc. The FAR states that supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>

STEAM TRAPS EVALUATION AND REPLACEMENT 
FOR BUILDINGS 1 AND 2

VETERANS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OF THE OZARKS
FAYETTEVILLE, ARKANSAS

SCOPE OF WORK - AMENDED 05/26/2010

Project Description

 VHSO Fayetteville has experienced a significant increase in temperature of condensate return water to the central steam plant as well as a noticeable increase to the volume of steam relieved to atmosphere (released from vent stacks) from existing condensate return units.  This loss of steam/condensate results in increased operating expenses and the elevated condensate return temperature negatively impacts the service life of system equipment and components. The objective of this project is to correct/mitigate the problem by locating, testing, and servicing (repair/replace as needed) steam traps located in buildings 1 and 2 of the VHSO Fayetteville, Arkansas campus.  The awarded contractor will be required to provide all labor, materials, components, equipment, tools, and supervision to accomplish the scope of work as described herein.  All work must comply with applicable VA standards, NFPA codes, ASME and ASTM standards, and VHSO procedures.  Refer to the accompanying project specifications for detailed requirements, codes, standards, and procedures applicable to this scope of work.

Project Specifications:
01 00 00  General Requirements
01 33 23  Shop Drawings, Product Data, and Samples
23 05 11  Common Work Results for HVAC and Steam Generation
23 22 13  Steam and Condensate Piping and Accessories

Description of Work 

1.	Applicable Buildings (Buildings 1 and 2) and System Description
Buildings 1 and 2 comprise the main hospital facility at the VHSO Fayetteville campus.  Building 1 is four stories and 159,745 gross square feet.   Building 2 is three stories and 35,862 gross square feet.  The buildings are connected by a three story corridor totaling 3,719 gross square feet.  The existing steam condensate return system is gravity return to distributed atmospheric condensate return units which then pump the condensate back to single atmospheric tank in the basement of building 1.  Duplex high temperature pumps (duty/standby, 2 hp, 50 gpm each) then return the condensate to the central steam plant.  High pressure steam (65 psi) is delivered to buildings 1 and 2 from the central steam plant.  Medium (45 psi), and low (5 psi) steam is piped throughout both buildings for a wide variety of uses including sterilization (autoclaves), domestic hot water (semi-instantaneous steam converters), HVAC heating water (shell and tube heat exchangers), HVAC humidification, food services, and radiant heating.  The majority of the known traps are bucket type with the remainder being F&T.

2.	Location of Steam Traps (Survey)
Conduct a comprehensive survey of the existing steam condensate return system to locate all steam traps within the project limits.  VHSO Engineering Service has record of 71  steam traps within the limits of this scope of work (this is based on a similar project from 2007).   VHSO Engineering Service predicts that there are a number of steam traps that have not been previously located or recorded.  Accessing some known traps and some areas for the survey will require infection control measures to be implemented (refer to accompanying specifications for details).  It is anticipated that some work will need to be performed on off hours (see Scheduling under Additional Requirements).  

3.	Evaluation of Steam Condensate Return System and Testing of Steam Traps
Provide personnel with the expertise to evaluate and diagnose problems with the condensate return system beyond a "like for like" trap replacement.  In industry terms, the level of evaluation expected is that of a "system audit", however, the term "audit" is not used here to imply any added liability to the awarded contractor.  The results of the condensate return system evaluation will be included in the final report (see Item 5 for additional details).  Steam traps will be tested to determine if functioning properly.  Testing must include both temperature (thermal) based and ultrasonic analysis.  

4.	Replacement of Steam Traps   
Steam traps found to not be functioning properly will be replaced (complete trap, re-build with body in place is not acceptable) as part of this project.  For the purposes of the bid, include all labor, equipment, and materials necessary to replace a quantity of 35 defective traps in this scope of work.  As noted in item 3, it is expected that the awarded contractor will not simply replace traps like for like, but that the service will include evaluation of the type of trap for the corresponding application.  Also provide a line item add for the replacement of additional steam traps beyond the 35 included herein (all inclusive price per each).   If the evaluation and testing does not require replacement of 35 traps, the balance of the traps are to be turned over to VHSO.

5.	Project Documentation

Submittals:  Provide submittals in accordance with the project specifications.  The awarded contractor will not begin work until the submittals have been approved by the COTR (Contracting Officer's Technical Representative).  Submittals must include (at a minimum) cut sheets on all equipment, components, and materials to be installed under this scope of work and a proposed schedule for the scope of work.  Submittals must also include resumes of the personnel designated to perform the work described herein.
 
Master List:  Provide a master list of all steam traps located.  This list must record the location, type, size, test result (pass/fail), date tested, date replaced (if applicable), and initials of contractor that performed the work.  

Maps of Locations:  Record the location of each steam trap surveyed on VHSO architectural floor plans.  VHSO will provide as-built architectural floor plans in electronic format.  It will be the responsibility of the awarded contractor to record the trap locations as the survey is conducted and provide back to VHSO a CAD drawing noting the locations for each trap surveyed.   

Final Report:  Submit a final report detailing findings from the condensate return system evaluation and survey.  It is expected that recommendations for improving the operation of VHSO Buildings 1 and 2 steam condensate return system (including, but not limited to, identification of misapplied types of traps, incorrect trap sizing, and identification of any discovered condensate piping issues) will be included.  The final report will also include as appendices the Master List of steam traps and the Maps of Locations.



6.	Training of Station Personnel and Special Tools
Provide 16 hours of "hands on" training for VHSO Engineering Service personnel on the testing of steam traps.  The training must cover the testing of each type of trap found in the survey.  The training will be provided in a minimum of 4 separate sessions.  The awarded contractor will provide VHSO Fayetteville an ultrasonic tester equivalent to UE Systems Ultraprobe 3000 (refer to specification 23 05 11 section 2.4.B for further details).  

7.	Project Acceptance
Project acceptance will be based on meeting the stated objective of reducing vent stack losses and lowering the condensate return temperature.  The vent stacks from the applicable buildings at project completion should only show intermittent flash releases of steam to atmosphere.  The return condensate temperature should be decreased from the current 205-210F temperature to less than 190F.  If the service performed as part of this scope of work does not accomplish these objectives and the awarded contractor believes that the vent stack losses and/or elevated condensate return temperatures are due to causes outside the scope of this project, the awarded contractor must explain/justify this in the final report to the COTR's satisfaction.  

Additional Requirements/Information

1.	Project Limits (Applicable Buildings)
This project applies to buildings one and two on the VHSO Fayetteville campus.

2.	Project Scheduling and Phasing.  
Station preference is for the scope of work to be accomplished as soon as possible.  The majority of the known steam traps are in areas accessible during normal business hours (primarily mechanical rooms).  It is anticipated that a relatively small percentage of the steam traps will be in areas that will require coordination with hospital operations, which could necessitate off hours work (nights and weekends).

3.	Pre-Bid Conference and Site Visit
A pre-bid conference and site visit will be held for the prospective bidders to attend.  It is highly recommended that all prospective bidders attend.   

4.	VHSO Provided Information,  Coordination, and COTR Contact Information
VHSO will provide current architectural plans and as-built drawings from previous projects in electronic format.  The quantity and detail of existing as-built plans concerning the steam system in buildings 1 and 2 are limited.  VHSO will also be provided results from the most recent survey of known steam traps (April 2010).  The awarded contractor will be responsible for verifying all existing site conditions prior to and during performance of this scope of work and is advised to use as-built drawings only to aid in the survey/investigation.  VHSO COTR will provide coordination for the project and access to applicable areas for the awarded contractor.

<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Transparency, fairness and functionality of the judicial process, training and discipline of attorneys, and corruption in the administrative and justice sectors are serious continuing shortcomings in the Albanian justice system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The AJSSP will address these challenges by focusing </span>on three areas: a) court efficiency, fairness, and transparency; b) strengthened civil society watchdog role, and c) better legal education and capabilities for lawyers and graduating law school students.</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">To improve court transparency and fairness the project will work directly with the courts to increase the utilization of court rooms so that fewer cases are heard in judges' chambers where the public cannot attend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cases that are heard in the court rooms will be recorded verbatim through the use of audio recording.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This initiative is strongly supported by both the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and the High Council of Justice (HCJ).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This will directly affect judges' behaviors and their decision making by putting a barrier to corruption-motivated decisions. The project will also introduce mediation as a technique for reducing case backlogs in commercial and family law cases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>UPDATE 1 (27 May 2010):<br /><br />The purpose of this update is to (1)&nbsp;announce the&nbsp;scheduling of the Pre-Solicitation Conference and provide details related thereto&nbsp;and (2) provide the draft Request for Proposals (RFP) for industry comment.<br /><br />The presolicitation conference for this acquisition is scheduled for 15 June 2010 at 7th and D St SW, Washington, DC.&nbsp; Due to security considerations, the deadline for registering for this conference is 03 June 2010.&nbsp; The attached file entitled "Frequently Asked Questions - TABSS Pre-Solicitation Conference" contains registration, location, and other details.<br /><br />The draft&nbsp;RFP and its corresponding attachments are included in this updated announcement.&nbsp; The Government is soliciting industry input&nbsp;to inform its&nbsp;development of&nbsp;the final RFP.&nbsp; Accordingly, please submit questions and comments related to the draft RFP no later than 08 June 2010, 5:00 PM EDT.&nbsp; To the maximum extent possible, these questions and comments will be addressed at the Pre-Solicitation Conference.<br /><br /><br /><br />ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:<br /><br />The primary goal of this acquisition is to establish a Department-Wide Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Contract vehicle for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide technical, acquisition, and business support services. The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components. <br />
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>

<p>Sole Source Authority:<br />The Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) specifically exempts USPTO from the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA - 41 USC 253).</p>
<p>Reason for Sole Source:<br />Only one responsible source: the supplies or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.</p>
<p>Contract Award Date: <br />May 27, 2010</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />The United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office issued a sole source award to Arpin International Group for an International Relocation and Storage of Household Effects, Unaccompanied Baggage and a vehicle.</p>
<p>Contract Type Justification:<br />This requirement is for relocation of Household Effects (HHE) and Unaccompanied Baggage (UAB) and a vehicle from Myersville, MD to Geneva, Switzerland. Relocations of this type require freight shipment by land, air, and sea. As such, the pricing is based upon the weight of the goods. Until the goods can actually be packed and placed in shipping containers to be weighed, the vendor is only able to estimate based upon a visual inspection of the property to be moved. It is impossible to get an exact weight estimate for this type of procurement, and therefore a time and materials contract is sought.</p>
<p>It shall be noted that the long-term storage encompassed in the option periods are fixed price, and this T&amp;M determination is only applicable to CLINs 0001, 0002, and 0004.</p>
<p>Total Contract Award:<br />$45,721.00</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />June 1, 2010 - May 31, 2011 with 3 option periods through November 30, 2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total Contract Award:<br />$45,721.00</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER W91278-08-C-0028.  The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-08-C-0028, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Alabama River Lakes Project, awarded to Eagle Aviation Services and Technology, Inc., 1801 Robert Fulton Drive STE 450, Reston, Virginia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for in order to continue the upgrading of Gunter Hill Campground, specifically to renovate the Antioch (Loop A), and access roads to both Antioch and Catoma (Loop B) loops. This work will include the re-routing and addition of roads, renovation of campsite spurs including addition of concrete parking pads, and upgrading of water and electric utility distribution systems.  The work will include removing some existing asphalt paving and outdated campsite furniture and border timbers.  The work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions which includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems in all of the recreation areas.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract.<BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of this recreation area.  2)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.
