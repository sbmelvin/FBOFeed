<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for infectious and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) Immunization Services Division has a requirement for the 2011 National Immunization Survey (NIS) and State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (SLAITS). The NIS is a random digit dialing (RDD) telephone survey, with immunization provider record check (PRC) verification, established in response to the immediate and continuing need for quality and timely data pertaining to the immunization coverage of pre-school children across the United States. The NIS is used to collect immunization information for such children, and other age groups, to monitor the need for immunization in the civilian noninstitutionalized population in non-overlapping, geographically defined areas. SLAITS is a broad based ongoing surveillance system available at the state and local levels for tracking and monitoring the health and well-being of children and adults. SLAITS uses the same sampling frame as the NIS, and immediately follows the NIS in selected households. CDC intends to Modify existing contract 200-2005-10460 with National Opinion Research Center (NORC) of Chicago, IL to provide an additional twelve (12) months of services for 2011 NIS and SLAITS under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, One Responsible Source. CDC believes that NORC has unique expertise and infrastructure available to execute the immediate requirement because they are the only known vendor who could be prepared to begin full execution of the survey no later than 1 January 2011. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541690, Other Scientific Technical and Consulting /services and the Small Business Size Standard is $7M. This is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is a solicitation available. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency to the email address below by 12 November 2010. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For questions and responses contact Lisa Brown by email at LBrown2@cdc.gov or Nancy M. Norton at Nnorton@cdc.gov .

<DESC>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is planning to release the Signal Location in Complex Environments (SLiCE) Program Broad Agency Announcement (IARPA-BAA-10-10) in December 2010. This program is classified at the TOP SECRET/ Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) level. In anticipation of this release, all potential bidders are required to provide a response to this notice so that IARPA can establish temporary Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) Co-use Agreements. This temporary co-use will allow potential bidders the ability to receive and prepare responses to this BAA, and will remain in effect throughout the pre-award phase of the program.
<p><br />PLEASE NOTE: For this program, companies without an existing SCIF will be unable to receive the BAA. Those companies without approved SCIF facilities who are interested in performing on this program may wish to explore teaming options with companies that have existing SCIFs. Based on information provided by the potential bidder, IARPA will make all reasonable attempts to have co-use agreements established; however, the Government cannot guarantee a co-use can be established for each SCIF. Hence, early submission of information will provide the best potential for successful co-use processing. A future announcement regarding availability of the BAA will be sent directly to those vendors who have received co-use agreement approval. IARPA will contact the Primary Point of Contact to announce BAA availability using the unclassified e-mail address provided.</p>
<p><br />Interested potential bidders are required to provide information to assist in the establishment of the requisite co-use agreement. Please send a request for the required information form to IARPA. All requests for the form should be directed to dni-iarpa-security@ugov.gov.

In accordance with VA Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern agrees that, in the performance of the contract, at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance will be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. The A/E must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and VetBiz databases. A/E firms can obtain CCR information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.

Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in contest of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions, and click a time/date stamp before final submission.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a requirement to evolve its learning architecture and learning delivery model within its Human Development (HD) Directorate, National Geospatial-Intelligence College (NGC). The NGC is migrating away from fully organically developed instructor-led learning solutions, to a learning architecture that enables not only core, highly structured learning solutions, but includes innovative and creative ways of meeting learners' needs through performance support, knowledge sharing and brokered opportunities. <br />
<p><br />The Request for Proposal (RFP) will cover NGA's requirements to support implementation of its Learning Architecture. Specifically, the services shall include the following: Program Management, Learning Integration, Learning Solutions, Academic Assessment, Technical Subject Matter Expertise consultation, Faculty Development, Registrar/Student Services and Other Direct costs. The Request for Proposal, number HM0177-11-R-0002 is estimated to be issued in November 2010. Contract award is estimated for May 2011.<br /><br /><br />The Center for Creative Learning Solutions (CCLS) procurement will be conducted under full and open competition with no set-aside. The government anticipates a single award contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods renewable annually, but not to exceed five years. The contract performance period is expected to commence on 01 June 2011. The contract will include Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) - Level of Effort CLIN and SubCLIN for Learning Integration and Learning Solutions; Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) - Performance Based CLINs for Faculty Development and Registration/Student Services; and a Cost Reimbursable CLIN for Other Direct Costs (ODCs). NGA expects to use Best Value - Trade Off evaluation methods and acquisition procedures as described in FAR Part 15. Contract award will be made to that offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government in terms of the evaluation factors listed in Section M of the RFP. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611710. <br /><br /><br />Any projected proposal due dates and times in this synopsis and any subsequent updates are estimates only; the actual proposal due date and time will be established in the final RFP. The RFP will be available to interested parties, along with any amendments issued, solely on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (https://www.fbo.gov). For information on how to register your company on FBO, to view or receive updates and notifications to the solicitation, please reference the FBO Vendor Guide located on the FBO web site home page. No paper copies of the solicitation will be furnished. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database (www.ccr.gov), prior to award of a government contract; failure to register in the DOD Central Registration Database will render your firm ineligible for award. Registration requires applicants to have a DUNS number. Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Department of Navy (DoN), on behalf of the Program Manager for Auxiliary Ships/Small Boats & Crafts (PMS325), for informational and planning purposes only.  PMS325 is conducting market research in support of preliminary planning for the Fleet Replenishment Oiler (T-AO class) recapitalization.  This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded based on this RFI.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI or any subsequent information requests that pertain to this RFI.  However, responses may be used in the determination of the appropriate acquisition strategy for a future acquisition.

Recapitalization of the T-AO 187 Fleet Replenishment Oiler Class is part of the U.S.
 Navys long-range shipbuilding plan.  On September 17, 2010, the Navy announced that its Fiscal Year 2012 budget submission would include acceleration of the double-hulled fleet oiler T-AO(X) production from 2017 to 2014.  Emphasis will be placed on compliance with environmental protection regulations, and on lowering total ownership costs (TOC) in the design and operation of the new oilers, including the use of mature, commercial technologies, and component commonality with other ships in the U.S. Navy fleet.  

The Navy is preparing to conduct an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to refine the key attributes of the T-AO(X).  The AoA will conduct various tradeoff analyses to determine the optimal solution in terms of cost, cargo capacity, speed and overall number of T-AO(X)s required to meet Fleet requirements.
  Alternatives will examine various quantities of bulk petroleum products (JP-5 and DFM); dry stores/packaged cargo, fleet freight, mail, personnel and other miscellaneous cargo to determine the optimum cargo capacities.  A range of dry cargo capacities at least 20% greater than the T-AO 187 Class should be considered.  The FY11 30 Year Shipbuilding Plan indicated that the Combat Logistics Force (CLF) would transition to a force composed of only two classes of ships, the T-AO(X) and the T-AKE. The AoA will evaluate T-AO(X), when operating with a T-AKE, as a possible replacement for the T-AOE 6 Class.

This RFI provides information on the Industry Day and on the solicitation of white papers for a total ship solution for the Fleet Replenishment Oiler capability.

Industry Day:  An Industry Day will be held in Washington, DC on November 18, 2010 to provide additional information and discussion on the T-AO 187 Class capabilities that are planned to be replaced and related plans for early industry engagement and study efforts.
 Attendance is voluntary and not required to respond to this RFI; however, registration is required to attend the Industry Day.  Registration is free, however space is limited.  Each organization is requested to limit attendance to three people.  Organizations should register no later than November 10, 2010.  To register submit the following information via email to taoxregistration@alionscience.com for each attendee:

a.	Name
b.	Position
c.	Primary Business (Shipbuilder/Design Agent/Equipment Vendor/other)
d.	Company
e.	Mailing Address
f.	Telephone Number
g.	E-mail Address 

A confirmation email will be sent providing additional details for the November 18, 2010 conference.

Information Sought:  PMS325 is soliciting white papers addressing total ship solutions that consider suitable design concepts, operational approaches, and other innovative concepts that may be applicable to the T-AO(X) program.
  

Responses for total ship solutions shall provide a summary of:

a.	primary ship characteristics and capabilities,
1.	A range of dry cargo capacities at least 20% greater than the T-AO 187 Class should be considered.   
2.	speed tradeoffs between 20 and 26 knots should be considered

2.	intra and inter-ship commonality with U.S.
 Navy fleet
3.	manning/workload reductions
4.	maintenance cost reductions
5.	technology advancements relative to current T-AO 187 Class

<CONTACT>Natalia Fisher Jackson, Contract Specialist , Phone 9195413564, Email fisher-jackson.natalia@epa.gov
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a (2) month term extension to contract EP-D-06-001 with E.H. Pechan &amp; Associates, Inc on a sole source basis pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 6.302-1(a)(2) which implements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) - "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". Since 2005, Pechan has provided support to the EPA Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) for services in support of program review and tracking. During this period of time, Pechan has provided support for cost, benefits, and economic analyses, as well as regulatory impacts and quality management for major office or air rule makings. Any interruption in this support poses a significant risk of missing statutory and court ordered deadlines, which is critical to the Agency's mission.
<p>Currently, Option Period IV of this contract expires on September 30, 2010. It is essential that court ordered deadlines in support of NAAQS, NSPS and NESHAP projects be met. Missing deadlines will result in a delay in completing standards which would increase the public's exposure to harmful toxic air pollutants. The proposed extension of this contract is to provide program review and tracking which includes the comprehensive evaluation of the air quality data and type of progress states are making toward meeting the NAAQS . Only Pechan, through this contract, can supply the needed services within the time frame the Agency requires. A critically important fact is that the activities within these source categories are under court ordered deadlines and involved in litigation, which requires the Agency to proceed with the work in progress without interruption. Interested parties who believe that they are qualified to perform</p>
<p>this effort within the time frames required by the Agency must submit a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to: US EPA, ATTN: Natalia Fisher Jackson, RTP Procurement Operations Division, MD 105-02, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 for consideration by the Agency. Capability statement should demonstrate the following: Ability to provide support for the technical functions of the EPA carrying out programs as specified in the CAA, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In carrying out the functions of this contract, the Contractor shall review all available program information, asses its adequacy and provide recommendations to EPA, resolve differences (explain and suggest approaches to resolving the differences), and fill data gaps (i.e., gather the needed data or recommend approaches for estimating the missing data for EPA approval). Program information includes</p>
<p>emission estimates, measurements, inventories, and other information pertinent to program areas in which EPA would undertake regulatory action, any of which could be found via literature search, internet searches, or as collected by EPA. Some work assignments may include developing and evaluating implementation and strategic alternatives, facilitating public meetings, reviewing public comments, performing supplemental technical analyses, and assisting in public outreach activities. The Contractor, at no time, will evaluate any implementation and strategic alternatives for which support was provided in the development of those same alternatives; although in the development of alternatives, contractors may state the advantages and disadvantages of that particular alternative. For all tasks assigned under this contract, the Contractor shall provide services in all data-gathering activities, report preparation phases,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>completion of necessary documents to provide technical background needed for formulating policy recommendations to EPA for review and approval, The contractor shall provide evaluation of alternatives and recommended solutions to problems encountered. If no affirmative responses are received within fifteen (15) days of this notice, the Government will proceed with the above mentioned two (2) month term extension of contract EP-d-06-001 with E.H. Pechan and Associates, Inc.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p style="BACKGROUND: white"><span style="COLOR: windowtext">&nbsp;</span><span style="COLOR: windowtext">The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), is conducting market research. This RFI is being used to determine the availability and capability of a GSA Schedule Holder that can provide</span> information system (IS) controls audit support services related to<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </em>the audit of the Schedule of Federal Debt for fiscal year 2011 with option years 2012 - 2015. The independent contractor will work with GAO to determine the nature, timing, and extent of testing to be performed based on the risk assessment. At the Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) and certain Federal Reserve Banks (FRB), GAO requires a risk based approach to testing IS controls. GAO requires testing of the (1) IS controls identified by the GAO financial audit team as significant to the audit of the Schedule of Federal Debt, (2) the relevant business application controls in the application in which the IS controls operate that could impact the effectiveness of the IS controls, and (3) the general controls related to the systems in which the application operates and other critical control points in the systems or networks that could impact the effectiveness of the IS controls. In addition, GAO also requires testing of the (1) specific controls identified by the GAO financial audit team in the applications, (2) review the testing performed by the Treasury Office of Inspector General's (OIG) contractor of the IS controls identified by the GAO financial audit team, and (3) follow-up on prior year deficiencies. The independent contractor will have to undertake out-of-town travel to Parkersburg, WV and various locations for the FRBs.</p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white">&nbsp;IS controls audit support services will be performed in compliance with GAO's financial audit methodology as set forth in the GAO/PCIE Financial Audit Manual (FAM) and with the GAO Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM). It should use the criteria in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requirements, including specifically the standards referred to in NIST Special Publication 800-53 (SP 800-53), Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems. The FAM provides a framework for performing federal financial statement audits in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). In conjunction with the FAM guidance, the FISCAM provides a methodology for performing information system control audits in accordance with GAGAS. NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets. NIST SP 800-53 provides specific guidelines for selecting and specifying security controls for information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government.</p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white"><span style="COLOR: windowtext">RFI may be used as a basis for a future solicitation and/or as a basis for more in-depth research about an organization's capability. GAO anticipates the award of a time and material price contract for this support.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white"><span style="COLOR: windowtext">&nbsp;</span><span style="COLOR: windowtext">Capability packages must not exceed 10 pages. The capability package for this RFI is not expected to be a proposal, but rather statements and descriptions about the company's existing experience (and past performance) in the area of</span> IS controls audit support services related to<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </em>the audit of the Schedule of Federal Debt.<span style="COLOR: windowtext; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"> </span>Areas where a contractor does not have prior experience should be noted as such.

<SOLNBR>FA8105-11-VOR
<RESPDATE>111010
<CONTACT>Jimmy A. Stephens, Contracting Officer, Phone 4057394131, Fax 4057393396, Email jimmy.stephens@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>PURPOSE<br />The C/KC-135 Contracting Branch, OC-ALC/GKCK, is conducting market research to determine cost, schedule and performance parameter required to install a new VHF Omni-Directional Radio (VOR)/Localizer (LOC)/Instrument Landing System (ILS) antenna on the vertical tail of the aircraft in accordance with the provided government drawings.
<p>DESCRIPTION<br />The current C/KC-135 VOR antenna is becoming unsupportable. A replacement antenna has been selected. Additional structural support is needed in the vertical tail for the installation of this VOR antenna. The government would like responses from industry regarding the cost and schedule to install a Government provided modification kit on up to 415 C/KC-135 aircraft at a contractor's facility to assist the Government in defining the acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>The installation of the structural kit and antenna requires removing and re-installing the vertical tail from the aircraft. During installation the wave guide must be removed from the tail. Removal of the vertical tail from the aircraft must follow procedures outlined in Technical Order (T.O.) 1C-135(K)R-2-2JG-19. The contractor must comply with the installation procedures outlined in Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) 1C-135-1799. Upon completion of the installation, a functional check flight (FCF) will be conducted consistent with AFMAN 11-217V3, which provides guidance for operational checks of approved system installation, and will verify operation of any system affected by removal of the vertical and the new VOR antenna.<br /><br />A Tailored FCF Checks required for the VOR/LOC Antenna Replacement would be as follows:<br />Interior Inspection: 23. Rudder &amp; Trim Tabs - Check<br />Starting Engines and Before Taxi: 13. EFAS - Check<br />After Takeoff - Climb: 2. Rudder Hydraulic Pressure - Check and 3. EFAS - Disengaged <br />Cruise: Flight Control System Trim Check (exclude steps 13, 14, 18 - 25); VOR &amp; TACAN Navigational Radio Receivers Check; Datalink Status Check; HF Voice Communications Check and EFAS Check<br /><br />In addition, a Localizer approach would be required to ensure the two receivers give the same info (verify visually during final approach). There is no -6CF-1 guidance for this.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Government is currently contemplating placing this workload against the existing C/KC-135 Programmed Depot Maintenance contract, FA8105-07-D-0002, (Boeing) the scope of which encompasses modification installs. This decision is based on current Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) data. However, the Government is open to alternative proposals from industry which would provide a more cost effective approach.<br /><br />RESPONSE<br />Responses should address:<br />1. Installation costs<br />2. Installation hours required per aircraft<br />3. If proposal contemplates performance in conjunction with an existing contract<br />4. Support equipment and special tools necessary for installation<br />5. Checkflight costs<br />6. Total time required from receipt to delivery of aircraft<br />7. Planned rates for over and above maintenance</p>
<p>Through this Request for Information (RFI) the Air Force is soliciting information in regard to the requirements listed above. It is emphasized that the Government will not pay for contractor efforts to respond to this RFI. This RFI is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. Nor is the Government obligated in any other way by this request. Information obtained from this document is for planning purposes only. Participants are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds. Interested sources must reply to this RFI no later than 5:00 PM CST 10 Nov 2010. Any questions may be directed to the undersigned at (405) 739-4131, or by e-mail to jimmy.stephens@tinker.af.mil .</p>

<DESC>&nbsp; THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry. <br /><br />The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Office of Information Technology (OIT), Passenger Systems Program Office (PSPO), is issuing this RFI regarding Non-Immigrant Data Processing Services (NIDPS). The Non-Immigrant Data Processing Services (NIDPS) provides arrival, departure, and ancillary information pertaining to non-immigrant aliens entering and exiting the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As defined in the Immigration and Naturalization Act, non-immigrants are aliens who enter the United States for a specified period of time for the purposes of accomplishing a particular objective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That objective may be a vacation, a business trip, attendance at a United States university or college, or some other activity of limited duration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most of these non-immigrants are classified as visitors for business or pleasure and stay only for a brief period, usually less than six months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Approximately 500,000 non-immigrants are admitted as students who generally stay for longer periods of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The remaining groups of non-immigrants fall into a variety of classifications, including temporary workers and diplomats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The scope of work under this program is limited to those persons required to file forms I-94, I-94W, I-530, I-736 and carriers required to submit CBP I-92 form.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Immigration and Naturalization Act mandates that CBP perform several functions with respect to the processing of non-immigrants for entry into the United States:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBP's mission is to enforce the laws of more than 40 agencies and to protect the revenue of the United States while facilitating trade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To assist in this mission, CBP maintains TECS, a data repository for I-94 Arrival / Departure Documents, I-94W Non-Immigrant Visa Waiver Arrival / Departure Documents, I-530 Update Status Adjustment of Voluntary Departure Documents, I-736 Guam Visa Waiver Documents and I-92 Aircraft/Vessel Documents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The system is used by CBP and other Federal agencies for tracking and controlling the recorded entry and departure of non-immigrants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to these mission-related functions, CBP must maintain control and issuance of the non-immigrant admission numbers, as well as maintain accurate statistics on the flow of non-immigrants in order to produce Congressional and annual reports, manage resources, support research and policy development, and respond to congressional and public inquiries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The type of data stored in TECS include the individual's biographical data, admission number, entry/departure data, travel information, citizenship data, visa data, visitor status, and intended address.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The primary source document for this purpose is the I-94 Arrival / Departure documents and the I-94W Non-Immigrant Visa Waiver Arrival / Departure documents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The purpose of the NIDPS program is to provide accurate information on non-immigrants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specific objectives are to support inspections requirements; track arrivals, departures, and updates of non-immigrants by operating and maintaining the information in TECS; provide a statistical reporting base for CBP; continue to strengthen the integrity of the data; improve access to all collected information; and make modifications necessary to support the Departure Control requirements of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996.</p>
<p>The Government's objective is to affect an optimal balance using technology, minimizing technical and schedule risk, maintaining customer service commitments, and minimizing life-cycle costs.</p>
<p>The objective of the RFI is to determine the availability of parties to perform these services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The acquired service will provide technological solutions that will streamline and automate entire life-cycle of the NIDPS document data entry processes to minimize labor costs and maximize technological efficiencies to keep costs as low as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This effort will include the:</p>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought for planning purposes. This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP). NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and PMA265 have established the requirements baseline for the F/A-18 A/B/C/D Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). The intent of this SOURCES SOUGHT is to conduct market research to determine if commercial Depot Level Maintenance and Engineering support facilities are available to support the Government's SLEP requirements. <br />Background: The F/A-18 A/B/C/D Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) analyzed the airframe to determine if United States Navy (USN) life extension goals for the 634 aircraft fleet are achievable. Many of the locations analyzed had fatigue lives less than the USN goal of 10,000 Flight Hours (FH) and require inspections, repairs and modifications. The USN SLEP program is designed to introduce High Flight Hour (HFH) inspections, repairs and SLEP modifications to the F/A-18 A/B/C/D airframe. The USN currently conducts inspections of F/A-18 A/B/C/D aircraft as they reach 8,000 FH as required by the HFH bulletin suite. Numerous stand alone bulletins also exist to manage and maintain airframe structural integrity. It is anticipated that the scope of the HFH and stand alone inspections will be increased as a result of the SLEP Programs.<br />Scope: In an effort to assess current industry capabilities, PMA265 has sponsored an Analysis of Options (AoO) to perform an Inspection, Repair and Modifications conceptual study looking at alternative Depot Level Maintenance and Engineering support solutions for as many as 30 aircraft per year. To support the AoO, a market survey is being conducted to obtain information regarding industry solutions to satisfy PMA265 requirements.<br />As a top level summary of required Depot Level Maintenance support and sustainment capabilities, the Depot Level Maintenance support and sustainment should be capable of meeting the following requirements:<br />Comprehensive disassembly, nondestructive testing, and inspection of forward, center, and aft fuselages, nacelles, inner wings, outer wings, vertical stabilators, Leading Edge Extensions (LEX), and aircraft systems / subsystems (including dynamic assemblies) and related aircraft components to assess severity of damage resulting from operational fatigue, the environment, maintenance, repair actions, and manufacturing defects.

<DESC>Request for Information
<p>Project: Next Generation Wireless Broadband Demonstrator</p>
<p>I. Description:</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotes. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback concerning its submission. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The Government is not seeking proposals at this time. Additionally, the Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Note that responses should not take the form of a proposal and will not be understood as such. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>II. Purpose:</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the US Department of Homeland Security is responsible for securing the nation's borders against illegal entry of people and goods while managing legitimate travel and trade. To support this mission, CBP owns, operates, and maintains one of the largest tactical voice communications infrastructures in the Federal government. TACCOM systems are the primary communications lifeline for agents and officers and are critical to their safety, as well as the success of their missions and operations. To continue effectively supporting this mission, the current tactical communications system must be upgraded in a cost-effective and operationally efficient manner.</p>
<p>The Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Directorate is the primary research and development arm of the Department of Homeland Security. The S&amp;T Directorate's mission is to improve homeland security by providing to customers state-of-the-art technology that helps them achieve their missions. S&amp;T customers include the operating components of the Department, and state, local, tribal and territorial emergency responders and officials. S&amp;T is working with CBP to examine what technology is currently available in the marketplace and determine where research is needed to help ensure that they are able to continue operating effectively. This RFI is being released as part of this effort.</p>
<p>CBP must provide agent and officer connectivity and interoperability that allow all users and mission partners to share the information they need, when they need it, in a form they can understand and act on with confidence, and protects information from those who should not have it. This relies on the ability to provide secure voice, data and video communications and will focus on building a network that leverages commercial infrastructure wherever possible and supports current, emerging and future requirements.</p>
<p>As part of this effort, DHS is gathering information on technology that can address one or more of the following objectives:</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE #1: LMR over Broadband. Describe a portable, P25-compliant radio that is able to accept a standardized (e.g., USB or PCMCIA card) broadband wireless modem. Radio modes must permit the transmission of encrypted voice through direct, radio to radio talk around (i.e., no infrastructure), over existing Land Mobile Radio (LMR) network(s) (P25 /Legacy) VHF, UHF and/or 800MHZ trunking or over any broadband wireless network or technology (e.g., 3G/4G, LTE, CDMA, GSM) based on RF environment (e.g., network availability).</p>
<p>Responses to this objective must address the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What is the plan to avoid obsolesce and reconcile the difference between lifecycle and technical refresh rates? (Currently, LMR radios at 7-10 years and commercial broadband technologies at 2 years) How can the proposed technology be built to a common standard interface or upgraded/maintained to ensure that it is functional regardless of what telecommunications infrastructure it operates on.</p>
<p>2. What is the level of maturity of the proposed technology? Fielded? In development? If fielded, provide examples of current usage, including a description of the operational environment in which it is deployed (e.g., user organization, geographic location, number of users, etc.)</p>
<p>3. What is the plan for product evolution? Is this radio a prototype or an existing technology that will be modified as requirements emerge?</p>
<p>4. What is the rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost (per unit) for the proposed technology? If this solution has not yet been fielded, ensure that this ROM cost includes and developmental or test costs.</p>
<p>5. Describe operation of the unit; how does the radio select the operating mode (i.e., direct (talk- around), LMR network or broadband network)</p>
<p>6. Does the radio permit bridging technologies to extend the range of coverage (e.g., mesh scenario; take in-bound broadband voice and transmit via LMR direct)</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE #2: Remote Radio Management. Describe a solution that enables the remote configuration of radios and other devices, to include radio parameters (e.g., channel, RF configurations) and encryption keys using broadband and/or existing LMR networks. This solution should support the ability to manage and establish interoperable dynamic talk groups by centralized operations centers.</p>
<p>Responses to this objective must address the following questions:</p>
<p>1. How will this proposed solution perform over-the-air-rekeying and remote programming (over-the air programming) for LMR radios and commercial devices?</p>
<p>2. How will this proposed solution create and manage dynamic talk groups that connect CBP, federal, state, local and Tribal (FSLT) participants? Note: CBP and FSLT participants may be using different networks and devices.</p>
<p>3. What is the level of maturity of the proposed technology? Fielded, in development? If fielded, provide examples of current usage.</p>
<p>4. Described how your solution enables transmit/receive voice while performing over-the-air rekeying and/or over-the-air programming in parallel, without disruption.</p>
<p>5. Describe the scalability of this solution. Are there any limitations on the number of radios that can use this solution?</p>
<p>6. Describe the number of components required in your solution and the approximate cost.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE #3: Integrate multiple Broadband networks with existing private, commercial and government networks. Describe a solution that integrates multiple networks (e.g., AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon, commercial networks) and various technologies (e.g., CDMA, GSM, LTE) to provide seamless coverage with session persistence and adds conditioning to deliver a higher grade of service with regard to security, priority access, and network latency.</p>
<p>Responses to this objective must address the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What type of, if any, roaming agreements are necessary as part of the proposed solution?</p>
<p>2. Describe how coverage could be extended by adding new sites or integrating public/private networks.</p>
<p>3. What, if any, is the concept for priority access including ruthless preemption?</p>
<p>4. How will this solution meet required Law Enforcement Grade of Service (GoS). The GOS must include the following parameters:</p>
<p>a. Latency requirements (e.,g , &lt; 100msec)<br />b. Law enforcement grade PTT (e.g., &lt; 500msec connect times)<br />c. Priority based access <br />d. Security (Encryption- AES)<br />e. High availability- (&gt; 95%)</p>
<p>5. Has this type of solution been used anywhere previously?</p>
<p>6. How will charges be incurred as part of this solution (i.e., what is the cost model?) - minutes per device, number of devices, number of networks linked together, etc.?</p>
<p>III. How to Respond:</p>
<p>Information provided in response to this RFI must be submitted no later than 4:00 PM (Eastern Time) on November 12th, 2010, in the form of an electronic "white paper." Please note that the collection of this data does not obligate the U.S. Government to the incorporation of the provided information nor does it obligate the Government to the procurement of the services. Proprietary information and trade secrets, if any, must be clearly marked on all materials. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. The white paper document shall be limited to 10 pages.</p>

<DESC>General Notice:  The purpose of this notice is to announce that the Government intends to enter into a contractual agreement with Sea Island Software, Inc. to provide hurricane planning services through the operation and maintenance of HURREVAC.  The Government is interested in determining if any other businesses can provide for the operation and maintenance of HURREVAC as described in this solicitation.<BR><BR>General Information:  The multi-agency National Hurricane Program (NHP) helps protect communities and residents from hurricane hazards through various projects and activities.  Established in 1985, the NHP has also prepared numerous Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HESs) and provided tools and technical assistance to State and local agencies in developing hurricane evacuation plans.  To support the management of HES data, the NHP commissioned the development of HURREVAC (HURRicane EVACuation) in 1988.  For the past 20 years, HURREVAC has been used by emergency managers to assist their evacuation decision making.  HURREVAC is a restricted-use, real time computer program funded by FEMA and USACE.  Its intent is for government emergency managers to track hurricanes and assist in evacuation decision-making for their communities based on information developed during the HES process, and real-time forecast data distributed by the National Weather Service (NWS) and the Tropical Prediction Center/National Hurricane Center (NHC).  The NHP decided to reprogram HURREVAC 2000 to take advantage of the latest Geographic Information System (GIS), programming, and Internet technologies.  As a result, HURREVAC 2000 was converted to the VB.NET program language in 2008 and 2009.  The new generation of HURREVAC is coined HURREVAC 2010.  Based on the HURREVAC User Survey recommendations that were completed prior to beginning the development of HURREVAC 2010, several enhancements were made to improve the intuitiveness, functionality and ease of use of HURREVAC.  The NHP is excited to release HURREVAC 2010 for the 2010 hurricane season and hopes that it meets the expectations and requirements of the HURREVAC user community.  HURREVAC has over 18,000 registered government users at all levels. Therefore, in order to support the transition from HURREVAC 2000 and HURREVAC 2010, the NHP will operate and maintain both versions of HURREVAC throughout the 2010 and 2011 hurricane seasons.<BR><BR>Requirements:  The objective of this Sources Sought is to determine if any other vendor has the experience to operate and maintain both programs, HURREVAC 2000 and HURREVAC 2010, year-round, provide real-time technical support for HURREVAC users, and prepare and conduct HURREVAC training consistent with the goals and objectives of the NHP.<BR><BR>Responses:  Responses should include their current business structures: (a) name of Company  include contact persons name, company address, telephone numbers (voice and fax), e-mail address and (b) Company size (i.e. large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, woman owned, etc.).  Also, the submission should include a description of your companys abilities and experience with the above listed requirements.  Narratives shall be no longer than ten pages.  Email responses are preferred. <BR><BR>Responses to this announcement will not be returned.  All submissions will be reviewed based on recent and past performance regarding HURREVAC expertise and experience according to the above listed requirements.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address:<BR>US Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore, 10 South Howard Street, Baltimore, MD 21203<BR><BR>Place of Performance:<BR>US Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore, 10 South Howard Street, Baltimore, MD 21203<BR><BR>Point of Contact(s):<BR>John R.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis, for market research purposes only, and not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.<br /><br />This sources sought is being published to identify potential sources capable of providing postal receipt/dispatching of all military mail and postal equipment and supplies originating/destined to/for military personnel assigned within the European Theater. The operation also services all military locations within the European Theater as well as other international destinations and all Continental United States designated delivery destinations. <br /><br />This effort is for sorting and loading/unloading of delivery trucks, receiving from and dispatching mail to air carriers to include registered/accountable mail). The US Army uses its own tractor-trailer type trucks for delivery of the mail throughout Germany. The current 7 day a week, 24 hour a day operation moves an average of 4,470 pieces (42 US tons) of mail daily including parcels. During Christmas season (mid November-Mid January) this increases to an average 6312 pieces (52 US tons) daily. Occasionally, during military contingencies the mail volume may increase up to 7000 pieces (56 US tons) per day, for a limited duration. In addition to routine mail, an average of 3,797 pieces of registered mail is moved per month and requires a separate, secure sorting/storage room with office space, able to accommodate at least 26 airline type cargo bins. Also, the operation uses a computer system to generate various reports showing the volume of mail processed and status of mail movement. The computer system used to scan, track, and sort the mail communicates with the United States Postal Service computer system. The mail arrives by trucks and is sorted for 26 delivery routes with a total of 29 stops. Trucks deliver the mail incoming from the 26 locations, plus mail incoming from the US via air. All mail is sorted and distributed to the delivery trucks within 14 hours. The trucks deliver the mail to their stops with 24 hours. During times when the mail volume increases, additional trucks (up to 10 or more) are used to distribute the mail. Outgoing mail is weighed before turnover to the air carriers and the weight verified before the carrier loads it on the aircraft. Assuming your organization is interested in providing this service (must have a US Secret facility clearance which requires US citizens having US Secret Clearances and German work permits for the Registry functions only). Please see attached DRAFT PWS for further information.<br /><br />Interested parties are requested to submit a statement of capability. The statement of capability shall include and shall not exceed 10 pages:<br />1. Contractor Name<br />a. Address<br />b. Point of Contact (POC)<br />c. POC phone number(s) and e-mail addresses<br />d. Cage code<br /><br />In addition interested parties are requested to fill-in the market research questionnaire.<br /><br />Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses, or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from industries responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP.

<DESC>Subj:  U.S. Marine Forces (USMC), Pacific, Media Monitoring Capability (MMC)

PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research for the ability to identify, analyze and assess internet-based, real-time, public discussion/debate and press information to improve the strategic situational awareness and planning of the Commander , Marine Forces Pacific (COMMARFORPAC) with respect to USMC events in Southeast Asia, specifically Japan and the Northern Mariannas (GUAM) island chain but also to include other potential areas of identified interest.     

As Commander of both the operational Marine force bases and installations that stretch from India, to Japan, Korea and the mainland USA, COMMARFORPAC/Commander Marine Force Bases Pacific (COMMARFORBASESPAC) works within an operational environment that is multifaceted, uncertain, and ambiguous.
  The complex and ill-structured issues the Commander commonly deals with are wide-ranging with a large amount of public discussion/debate and press reporting taking place on the internet.  Many of these issues are of significant strategic importance and have an immediate impact on operations, readiness, families, and morale.  A full understanding of the complexities and perspectives surrounding these issues is required to ensure the Commander, MARFORPACs ability to make sound, informed decisions and assess MARFORPACs operational readiness and mission effectiveness.

Given these responsibilities, COMMARFORPAC/COMMARFORBASESPAC has a mission essential requirement to be able to assess internet-based information pertinent to COMMARFORPAC.
   The public conditions are increasingly less dependent on legacy forms of public conversation and increasingly more dependent to the web-based internet world of cyber communities, known or otherwise.  Additionally it requires the ability to assess the overall discussion taking place and occurring in languages for countries where the majority of our MARFORPAC forces operate from and are based (mainly Japanese, Korean and English but not limited to these languages).  We are looking for ideas on presenting the relevant information in real-time for critical issues, and may require daily summaries, weekly synopsis or monthly assessments in order to enhance the COMMARFORPACs situational awareness for his ability to make fully informed decisions and reduce risk associated with operations in the Pacific.
  

Responses to this RFI shall not exceed ten (10) pages, including cover letter and contact information.  Subject response must contain:  (1) Capability statement sufficient to demonstrate 
capabilities related to the stated objectives, (2) Link to the respondents appropriate GSA Schedule, if applicable; and (3) Citation of two current, or past DOD, or civilian federal customers (i.e., within the past 2 years), to include contract number, point of contact, telephone number, and e-mail address.     

Responses are due by 3:00 PM, HST on 24 November 2010.   Please submit e-mail responses to Bill at e-mail address rodger.phillips@usmc.mil.  Ensure the subject line of the submission identified the RFI number and the name of the company submitting the response.

NOTE:  Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these services or to issue a solicitation.
  No solicitation exists at this time; however, should the optimal acquisition strategy indicate that use of GSA schedules is the most viable option, only those firms responding to this RFI and considered most capable will be issued the resulting RFQ.  The government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.  Any information considered proprietary should be clearly marked as such on the submission.

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to search for qualified vendors capable of meeting the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requirements for an analytical tool to provide the Homelessness Program Office the capability to predict program impacts based on various statistical measures such, demographic changes in the Veteran population both nationally and in various geographical locations, various socio-economic  such as unemployment, the migration of industry, the impact of macro-economic forces that may affect homelessness such as employment and the availability of affordable housing, the ability of various VA program interventions to reduce or prevent homelessness, and the ability of various VA and mainstream benefit programs to reduce or prevent homelessness.  This RFI provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their ideas and/or current tools related to this request.

The Homelessness Program would like to be able to model potential in Veteran's Homelessness based on:
1.  Existing data on current homelessness provided by HUD through AHAR (Annual Homelessness Assessment Report) and PIT (Point-in-Time).
2.  Utilization of VA resources to either move Veterans out of homelessness or prevent homelessness
3.  Macro-economic trends that may be influencing the overall homeless rate (such as unemployment rate, industry trends,  levels of federal benefits assistance, and the availability of affordable housing)
4.  Demographic trends among the Veteran population that factor in the number of Veterans, age, poverty level as variable that will influence future homelessness among Veterans.

The following is just an example of a possible analytical tool:

Consider the following causes of homelessness:
1.	Underemployment or Unemployment
2.	Medical or mental health crisis
3.	Dislocation, including eviction and loss of social/family support
4.	Inability to access affordable housing due to lack of income, inadequate supply of units, poor credit history, felony history and/or current legal problems
5.	Inability of those discharged from the military to adjust to civilian life

Using figures that relate to the above causes, the analytical tool can then provide a determination of homelessness index (either increasing or decreasing).  This number may vary depending on geography, and thus a national index is derived as well as a regional homeless index is available. Please model various assumptions that factor in different potential environments such as an unchanged or improved national employment; unchanged levels of federal assistance or reduced levels of such assistance; current pace of combat operations or reduced levels of conflict.

The derived homelessness index will then be used by the same analytical tool to assess impact to programs within the VA, prescribing an increase or decrease in terms of percent for a program.



In the event VA proceeds to a formal request for proposals, VA reserves the right to consider alternative engagement models.

This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of a competitive process.

The Government is open to considering teaming and prime/subcontractor relationships for this effort. If interested, please submit a Capabilities Statement, limited to ten (10) pages for your company, your teammates and or subcontractors and also denote the business size for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services.  Please include company name, company address, and DUNS Number (if applicable).  Also, please indicate if you, your teammates and/or subcontractors are a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or a Veteran Owned Small Business.

Respondents should address the following questions: 

1. Does your company possess the capabilities to independently provide some or all of the requirements described above?  If not, please describe your team/subcontracting arrangements and/or approach.

2. How would your company propose providing the tool above?

3. Is your company currently providing similar solutions to another government agency or other non-government customer?  If so, please identify the agency or non-government customer.  If you are unwilling to share your customer's identity, please address whether your company offers the same or similar services commercially (outside the federal Government).  

Responses are requested no later than close of business on November 10, 2010, via email to Julina.Lee@va.gov or Kendra.Miller2@va.gov.

<p>This office is seeking a solution to:</p>
<p>1. Provide transportation of equipment to and from forward airports and the owning installations. Each piece of equipment would require roughly 4-10 round trips per year for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance.</p>
<p>2. Assume responsibility for the equipment while it is positioned at the forward operating locations, and while in transit. This would include securing and maintaining accountability for the equipment.</p>
<p>3. Perform daily service checks on the equipment. This would include ensuring proper fluid levels are maintained, and ensuring that the Aerospace Ground Equipment is in serviceable condition (i.e. no major defects). The contractor would coordinate with the owning Maintenance Group for necessary maintenance.</p>
<p>4. Providing equipment to fuels staff at each airport. Fuels staff uses the equipment to quick turn government aircraft daily. Equipment must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week without interruption in service due to maintenance.</p>
<p><br />All responses should be received no later than 1:00 P.M. Central time, 12 Nov 2010.</p>

<DESC>US Army RDECOM Contracting Center intends to award a purchase order to SRC, Inc. in the amount of $23,756.00 on a sole source basis.  This action is a follow-on to contract W91CRB-10-C-0050. Under W91CRB-10-C-0050, Syracuse Research Corporation (SRC), Inc. procured, integrated and tested rugged data collectors on two A160s for the FORESTER airborne radar system.  Two of the data recorders from a FORESTER system were recently involved in a hard landing which potentially caused some damage.  These units require evaluation by SRC and the vendor, Ampex, to determine their suitability for future operations.  Upon return of the units SRC will re-integrate the units on the flight platform and test the units on the ground to validate operation.  There is no other contractor that is intimately knowledgeable of the FORESTER system and subsystems such as the flight recorder because SRC conducted all of the research and resultant design implementation.<BR><BR>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority. <br />Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. <br />(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: <br />(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br />(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. <br />(3) For long-term contracts- <br />(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and <br />(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter. <br />(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/. <br />(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees. <br />(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. <br />(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. <br />(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: <br />The Contractor represents that it o is, o is not a small business concern under NAICS Code __332911___________ assigned to contract number ______________. <br />[Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>

<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>

Nothing contained herein shall serve to alter either party's liability or responsibility under CERCLA.<br />(3) Materials contained in ship systems are not waste until after removal from the system.<br />(b) IDENTIFICATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTES<br />Work Item 077-01-001 of this contract identifies the types and amounts of hazardous wastes that are required to be removed by the Contractor, or that are expected to be generated, during the performance of work under this contract.<br />(c) GENERATOR IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS<br />(1) Documentation related to hazardous waste generated solely by the physical actions of ship's force or Navy employees on board the vessel shall only bear a generator identification number issued to the Navy pursuant to applicable law.<br />(2) Documentation related to hazardous waste generated solely by the physical actions of Contractor personnel shall only bear a generator identification number issued to the Contractor pursuant to applicable law. Regardless of the presence of other materials in or on the shipboard systems or structures which may have qualified a waste stream as hazardous, where the Contractor performs work on a system or structure using materials (whether or not the use of such materials was specified by the Navy) which by themselves would cause the waste from such work to be a hazardous waste, documentation related to such waste shall only bear a generator identification number issued to the Contractor.<br />(3) Documentation related to hazardous waste generated by the combined physical actions of Navy and Contractor personnel shall bear a generator identification number issued to the Contractor pursuant to applicable law and shall also cite in the remarks block a generator identification number issued to the Navy pursuant to applicable law.<br />(4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c) (1) - (c) (3) above, hazardous wastes are considered to be co-generated in cases where: (a) the Contractor merely drains a system and such drainage creates hazardous waste or (b) the Contractor performs work on a system or structure using materials which by themselves would not cause the waste from such work to be hazardous waste but such work nonetheless creates a hazardous waste. Documentation related to such co-generated waste shall bear a generator identification number in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) (3) above.<br />(5) In the event of a failure by the parties to agree to the assignment of a generator identification number to any hazardous waste as set forth in paragraphs (c) (1) through (c) (4) above, the Government may direct which party or parties shall provide generator identification numbers for the waste and such number(s) shall be used on all required documentation. Any disagreement with this direction shall be a dispute within the meaning of clause of this contract entitled "DISPUTES" (FAR 52.233-1). However, the Contractor shall not stop any work but shall continue with performance of all work under this contract as specified in the "DISPUTES" clause.<br />(6) Hazardous Waste Manifests for wastes described in (c) (2), (c) (3), and (c) (4) above (and (c) (5) as applicable), the Contractor shall sign the generator certification on the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest whenever use of the Manifest is required for disposal. The Contractor shall obtain concurrence with the categorization of wastes under paragraphs (c) (3) and (c) (4) above before completion of the manifest. Manifests prepared pursuant to paragraph (c) (1) above shall be presented to the SUPERVISOR for completion after the hazardous waste has been identified.<br />(7) For purposes of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) herein, if the Contractor, while performing work at a Government facility, cannot obtain a separate generator identification number from the State in which the availability will be performed, the Contractor shall notify the SUPERVISOR within 3 business days of receipt of written notification by the State. After obtaining the SUPERVISOR'S approval, the Contractor shall use the Navy site generator identification number and insert in the remarks block the contractor generator identification number issued for the site where his main facilities are located. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) herein, if the work is being performed at a contractor facility and the Government cannot obtain a separate generator identification number for the State, the Government shall use the Contractor site generator identification number and shall cite in the remarks block a Navy generator identification number. In both instances described above, the Contractor shall prepare the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest described in paragraph (c) (6) above and present it to the SUPERVISOR for completion.</p>

<DESC><BR>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, the test program in FAR Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued under Request for Quotation (RFQ) number W912LP-11-Q-0008.  All proposals shall reference the RFQ number and shall be submitted by 8:00 a.m. local time on 2 November 2010. The anticipated award date is 5 November 2010. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses for commercial items in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-46 dated 29 September 2010.  This acquisition is open for Full & Open Competition. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 611519 size standard of $7.0m. Contract line item numbers and quantities: CLIN 0001, Base Year (FY 11) for Physical Surveillance, 2 course iterations; CLIN 0002, CMR Reporting for Base Year (FY 11); CLIN 0003, Option Year #1 (FY 12) for Physical Surveillance, 4 course iterations; CLIN 0004, CMR Reporting for Option Year #1 (FY 12);<BR>CLIN 0005, Option Year #2 (FY 13) for Physical Surveillance, 4 course iterations; CLIN 0006, CMR Reporting for Option Year #2 (FY 13); CLIN 0007, Option Year #3 (FY 14) for Physical Surveillance, 4 course iterations; CLIN 0008, CMR Reporting for Option Year #3 (FY 14); CLIN 0009, Option Year #4 (FY 15) for Physical Surveillance, 4 course iterations; CLIN 0010, CMR Reporting for Option Year #4 (FY 15); Vendors shall review the Statement of Work for a detailed list of course requirements and items to be submitted as part of their proposal.  The prices provided for each of the SUB CLIN above shall include all labor, material, travel costs, supervision, and associated services to carry out the Midwest Counterdrug Training Centers (MCTC) mission requirements as defined in the Statement of Work. Clarification for CLINS 0002, 0004, 0006, 0008, and 0010: the vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR); the vendor may apply a price to the CMR CLINs or may opt to complete the mandatory reporting at no cost to the Government. However, as a clear indicator of vendors intention, CLIN pricing must reflect a zero cost if vendor chooses to waive the CMR Reporting fee. Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely complete all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.  The Government will award a firm-fixed priced contract resulting from this solicitation, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be Best Value to the Government.

<p>Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request For Information (CRFI)</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION <br />The Air Force is in advanced planning to acquire a Personnel Recovery (PR) Recapitalization aircraft to replace the current United States Air Force (USAF) HH-60G fleet. The AF is only interested in full air vehicle systems solutions at this time. To assist in this planning, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), ASC/WISV, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of meeting the requirements of the approved Capability Development Document (CDD).</p>
<p>It is anticipated the United States Air Force will replace an estimated 112 HH-60G air vehicles. Contract award is anticipated to be in FY12. Meeting an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) by the end of FY15 is desired. FY15 IOC requires delivery of eight (8) aircraft with training systems and support in place (initial spares, support equipment, technical data). Describe the capabilities your solution can meet and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities. If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired. Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities; provide rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other technical information of potential solutions. <br /><br />This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSS/CRFI. This SSS/CRFI is part of ongoing Government conducted market research for planning purposes. It is NOT a solicitation. The Government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal. The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the US Government and will not be returned. Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition approach. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts and non-disclosure agreements. The Government will determine whether its contractor team members have any organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The Government will not reply to information received. The Government anticipates conducting one-on-one discussions with respondents. For planning purposes, the Government is targeting November 2010 for these meetings.</p>
<p>PURPOSE <br />The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is to (1) update the responses to March 2010 Personnel Recovery Recapitalization Program (HH-60 Recap) Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (CRFI); (2) to engage industry a second time based on updated information; (3) to identify sources and capability that can meet a desired Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY15 if a contract award is made in FY12; and (4) to assist the Air Force in planning and ascertaining schedule, cost and technical risk associated with acquisition of the HH-60 Recap air vehicle. The information respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition approach. The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP. The Mission Profile, Standard Configuration Load (SCL) and Capabilities have been updated from the original March 2010 SSS/CRFI.<br /><br />RESPONSE GUIDANCE <br />Information received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that &lsquo;publicly-releasable' and &lsquo;proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one responder to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>SSS/CRFI responses should include a Cover page containing identification of the company Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, street address, and large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone) designation for North American Industry Classification System (NACICS) code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing) and the names and telephone numbers of the technical Point of Contact (POC) and the overall company POC (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company).</p>
<p>Responses are limited to 30 pages and must be received by 1300 Eastern Time 27 Oct 2010. Responses must be submitted via eight (8) hard copies with a CD copy in text searchable Portable Document Format (.pdf). Responses should be sent to the Contracting Officer, Jim Dinwoody, ASC/WISK, james.dinwoody@wpafb.af.mil, 1895 Fifth Street, Building 46, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7233.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis provide notification of the 50th Contracting Squadron's (50 CONS) intent to extend contract FA2550-01-D-0003, Technical Services and Space Operations Support (TSSOS) for a period of&nbsp;four (4) months. The Period of Performance for this extension will be from 1 Jan 11 through 30&nbsp;Apr 11. The extension will be performed by the incumbent contractor, WYLE Information Systems, LLC (WYLE IS); 1651 Old Meadow Road, 5th Floor, McLean, VA 22102.&nbsp; A small business set-aside was awarded on&nbsp;7 Nov 01 for support to the Space Innovation and Development Center (SIDC) mission requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support is provided at the following SIDC sites/locations: Cheyenne Mountain AFS, CO;&nbsp;Nellis AFB NV; Patrick AFB FL; Schriever&nbsp;AFB CO; and Vandenberg AFB CA. The extension will be performed under the same terms and conditions as the existing contract&nbsp;and will support the following SIDC mission areas:&nbsp; AF TENCAP; the Integration Division (SIDC/ID); SIDC Det 1, Nellis; 595th Space Group (595 SG) which includes the 17th Test Squadron (17 TS) and the Advanced Space Operations School (ASOpS). The contract type is cost-plus award fee. The extension will provide for continuation of uninterrupted services of the SIDC operations described above. This&nbsp;four (4) month extension of services is accomplished pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements" as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Not awarding a&nbsp;four (4) month extension would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of the work required during the&nbsp;four (4) month extension period would be advantageous to the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this contract extension period based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to Ms. Stacy Reed at <a href="mailto:Stacy.Reed@schriever.af.mil">Stacy.Reed@schriever.af.mil</a>.

<DESC>The synopsis originally published on September 16, is hereby modified to provide responses to questions received to date, and to extend the RFI closing date from October 28 to November 10, 2010.<BR><BR>QUESTION 1:  Would you please provide some clarification with respect to the requirement to provide ROM pricing? The request to provide ROM pricing does not appear in the main body of the request but however when you dig a bit deeper there is a reference to it in the additional information paper available via the link. Could you please confirm whether ROM prices will be required for inclusion with the response to this RFI?<BR><BR>ANSWER 1:  The Government is not looking for a proposal at this point since no requirement has been formulated, but we would at least like to get an idea of your estimated cost of the solution you propose, including recurring and NRE costs.  Thus we're requesting only ROM pricing be submitted with your response to the RFI.  The main body of the text was primarily intended as a summary of the RFI, with additional information in the attachment for companies with a possible interest in responding to the RFI.  The main body of the RFI announcement and the attachment form the complete RFI, as it was not possible to provide all information needed in the main body.<BR><BR><BR>QUESTION 2:  Will the government provide the RFI in a Word format instead of the current .pdf format.<BR><BR>ANSWER 2:  No.<BR><BR><BR>QUESTION 3:   Reference Paragraph 2.3.3  TCM-DES (TRADOC Capability Manager  Directorate of Evaluation and Standardization).  PM UAS will provide the TCM-DES with specific Fleet Management information that will help drive improvements in their primary areas of responsibility.   <BR><BR>What specifically do you want us to address within the context of this section?<BR><BR>ANSWER 3:  Describe the approaches/technologies you have that can provide information in regards to Pending Maintenance Actions, and in regards to Readiness of the respective PM UAS platforms being Full Mission Capable, Partial Mission Capable, or Non-Mission Capable.<BR><BR><BR>QUESTION  4:   On page 2 of the instructions under Special Note, it states that Digital Fusion Solutions, Inc will assist the Government in review of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Will Digital Fusion Solutions or Kratos Defense & Security Systems be submitting responses to the RFI?

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong></p>
<p>In June 2010, the Federal Cloud Computing Initiative (FCCI) established an Email Working Group to coordinate across government and industry on behalf of the FCCI, and to be the<span style="COLOR: #111111"> source of information, solutions, and processes that foster adoption of SaaS Email within the Federal Government. The working group quickly ramped up and began developing a strategy to deliver SaaS Email </span>acquisition capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>In partnership with <span style="COLOR: #111111">GSA SmartBUY and </span>DoD Enterprise Software Initiative, <span style="COLOR: #111111">the FCCI </span>released an RFI on Software as a Service Email on August 30, 2010 (posted on FBO.gov https://www.fbo.gov/?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=d9c037373cc9491c9b3af089ad4e6e85&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1). The intent of the RFI was to gain insight into how the Federal Government ordering activities can replace their current enterprise support for email and collaboration with a highly innovative, creative, cost-effective, and evolving environment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>The FCCI will host a SaaS Email briefing on November 1, 2010. The purpose of this event is to brief agencies and vendors on the FCCI's acquisition strategy for SaaS Email, and to get feedback on the draft requirements so that the resulting acquisition can best meet the needs of the Federal Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The briefing will be held at MITRE in McLean, VA. Participants must register for this event online by October 25, 2010.

<DESC><br />*** This presolicitation is designed to give industry advanced notice of National Geospatial Intelligence Agency's intention to request proposals for the Center for Creative Learning Solutions in the near future. This notice does <strong>NOT</strong> require action or a response by offerors. The response date is simply the date in which this announcement will be archived by FedBizOps. ***<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a requirement to evolve its learning architecture and learning delivery model within its Human Development (HD) Directorate, National Geospatial-Intelligence College (NGC). The NGC is migrating away from fully organically developed instructor-led learning solutions, to a learning architecture that enables not only core, highly structured learning solutions, but includes innovative and creative ways of meeting learners' needs through performance support, knowledge sharing and brokered opportunities. <br />
<p><br />The Request for Proposal (RFP) will cover NGA's requirements to support implementation of its Learning Architecture. Specifically, the services shall include the following: Program Management, Learning Integration, Learning Solutions, Academic Assessment, Technical Subject Matter Expertise consultation, Faculty Development, Registrar/Student Services and Other Direct costs. The Request for Proposal, number HM0177-11-R-0002 is estimated to be issued in November 2010. Contract award is estimated for May 2011.<br /><br /><br />The Center for Creative Learning Solutions (CCLS) procurement will be conducted under full and open competition with no set-aside. The government anticipates a single award contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods renewable annually, but not to exceed five years. The contract performance period is expected to commence on 01 June 2011. The contract will include Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) - Level of Effort CLIN and SubCLIN for Learning Integration and Learning Solutions; Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) - Performance Based CLINs for Faculty Development and Registration/Student Services; and a Cost Reimbursable CLIN for Other Direct Costs (ODCs). NGA expects to use Best Value - Trade Off evaluation methods and acquisition procedures as described in FAR Part 15. Contract award will be made to that offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government in terms of the evaluation factors listed in Section M of the RFP. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611710. <br /><br /><br />Any projected proposal due dates and times in this synopsis and any subsequent updates are estimates only; the actual proposal due date and time will be established in the final RFP. The RFP will be available to interested parties, along with any amendments issued, solely on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (https://www.fbo.gov). For information on how to register your company on FBO, to view or receive updates and notifications to the solicitation, please reference the FBO Vendor Guide located on the FBO web site home page. No paper copies of the solicitation will be furnished. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database (www.ccr.gov), prior to award of a government contract; failure to register in the DOD Central Registration Database will render your firm ineligible for award. Registration requires applicants to have a DUNS number. Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award.

<RESPDATE>111210
<CONTACT>Natalia Fisher Jackson, Contract Specialist , Phone 9195413564, Email fisher-jackson.natalia@epa.gov
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a five (5) month term extension to contract EP-D-06-001 with E.H. Pechan &amp; Associates, Inc on a sole source basis pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 6.302-1(a)(2) which implements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) - "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". Since 2005, Pechan has provided support to the EPA Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) for services in support of program review and tracking. During this period of time, Pechan has provided support for cost, benefits, and economic analyses, as well as regulatory impacts and quality management for major office or air rule makings. Any interruption in this support poses a significant risk of missing statutory and court ordered deadlines, which is critical to the Agency's mission. <br /><br />Currently, Option Period IV of this contract expires on November 30, 2010. It is essential that court ordered deadlines in support of NAAQS, NSPS and NESHAP projects be met. Missing deadlines will result in a delay in completing standards which would increase the public's exposure to harmful toxic air pollutants. The proposed extension of this contract is to provide program review and tracking which includes the comprehensive evaluation of the air quality data and type of progress states are making toward meeting the NAAQS . Only Pechan, through this contract, can supply the needed services within the time frame the Agency requires. A critically important fact is that the activities within these source categories are under court ordered deadlines and involved in litigation, which requires the Agency to proceed with the work in progress without interruption. Interested parties who believe that they are qualified to perform this effort within the time frames required by the Agency must submit a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to: US EPA, ATTN: Natalia Fisher Jackson, RTP Procurement Operations Division, MD 105-02, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 for consideration by the Agency. Capability statement should demonstrate the following: Ability to provide support for the technical functions of the EPA carrying out programs as specified in the CAA, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In carrying out the functions of this contract, the Contractor shall review all available program information, asses its adequacy and provide recommendations to EPA, resolve differences (explain and suggest approaches to resolving the differences), and fill data gaps (i.e., gather the needed data or recommend approaches for estimating the missing data for EPA approval). Program information includesemission estimates, measurements, inventories, and other information pertinent to program areas in which EPA would undertake regulatory action, any of which could be found via literature search, internet searches, or as collected by EPA. Some work assignments may include developing and evaluating implementation and strategic alternatives, facilitating public meetings, reviewing public comments, performing supplemental technical analyses, and assisting in public outreach activities. The Contractor, at no time, will evaluate any implementation and strategic alternatives for which support was provided in the development of those same alternatives; although in the development of alternatives, contractors may state the advantages and disadvantages of that particular alternative. For all tasks assigned under this contract, the Contractor shall provide services in all data-gathering activities, report preparation phases,completion of necessary documents to provide technical background needed for formulating policy recommendations to EPA for review and approval, The contractor shall provide evaluation of alternatives and recommended solutions to problems encountered. If no affirmative responses are received within fifteen (15) days of this notice, the Government will proceed with the above mentioned&nbsp;five (5) month term extension of contract EP-D-06-001 with E.H. Pechan and Associates, Inc.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice HUBZone Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses, and General Purpose Warehouses located West of the Mississippi River (AR, AZ, CA, CO, IA, KS, LA, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, NM, NV, OK, OR, SD, TX, UT, WA, WY). The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Cody Cotten, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail at cody.d.cotten@usace.army.mil . FOR INFORMATION ONLY: FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Business Process. USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but are also the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned. Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization. Of those forty one, Fort Worth District (SWF) has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition (WT) facilities, Reception Station Barracks, Drill Sergeant Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses. The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. <br /><br />SCOPE OF WORK: <br /><br />Central Issue Warehouses: The primary mission of the CIFs is to provide a single point for receipt, storage, issue, exchange, and return of all authorized organizational clothing and individual equipment items at the specified United States Army Installation. CIF facilities provide storage capabilities combined with office space, used in the administration of issuing soldiers equipment as needed. The facilities support open storage for deployment functions as necessary by the Army Unit occupying the building. The functional and operational requirements of the CIW require that the design be based on the characteristics of the material being handled and stored, the volume and flow pattern through the facility, and the inventory pattern. Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.<br />Support Supply Activity Warehouses: SSAs will provide a facility capable of storing and maintaining the Army prepositioned stocks (APS) and items required for active duty operation. The facility is similar to a parts wholesale warehouse. The functional and operational requirements of the SSA require that the design be based on the Adapt-Build Model standard design. Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will not vary.<br />General Purpose Warehouses: GPWs will be capable of supporting the storage of various equipment and materials, up to a Moderate-hazard level. GPW facilities may have substantially differing design and operational requirements in order to meet the Armys needs on a worldwide basis. The facility type will provide an acceptable relationship between actual equipment dimensions, performance characteristics and the building dimensions. GPWs are intended to be similar both functionally and technically to private sector industrial warehouses Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; water, sewer, gas; paving, walks, curbs and gutters; storm drainage; site improvements and information systems. Access for persons with disabilities will be provided in public areas. Comprehensive building and furnishings related interior design services are required. Comprehensive warehouse pallet and racking systems related to warehouse functional design services are required. Air conditioning will be provided in administrative areas, and warehouse areas will be ventilated and heated. Supporting work includes fire protection sprinkler and fire detection systems of the warehouses. <br />It is the intent of Government to issue design-build and adapt-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region.<br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: <br />This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process. In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process. <br />In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal. The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost. To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award. In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee. <br />The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach; Phase II Volume I: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Sustainability Requirements. Volume II: Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns. All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price. <br />Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 18 Oct 2010 under solicitation number W9126G-11-R-0053. This procurement is HUBZone set-aside. Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 18 Nov 2010 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation). The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction). The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.<br /><br />MATOC: <br />The Government intends to award at least two and up to five contracts as a result of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a C-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude. The remaining capacity would then be re-advertised as a full and open competition. Each contract will remain active: 1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government. It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation. Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type. THIS SOLICITATION IS SET-ASIDE FOR HUBZone.<br /><br />The total estimated contract capacity is $263,000,000. The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months. The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government. The minimum guarantee will be $ 2,500. The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only. Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders. The minimum task order limitation is $1,000,000. The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $19,000,000. The maximum combination of orders is $17,500,000. The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation. Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price. <br />The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition. There will be no public bid opening. Because of the size of our solicitations, you should not attempt to view them online. Rather download them to your local hard drive and then open them. Use of the FedBizOps website requires prior registration at https://www.fbo.gov. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the FedBizOps web site (using the above link) for amendments to the solicitation. Offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov/), in order to receive a Government contract award.<br />

<DESC>AMENDMENT TO PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE VA118-RFI-10-0045
Closing of Vendor Transformation Forum Challenges and Ideas Acquisition Process

On November 2, 2009, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center posted Pre-Solicitation Notice VA118-RFI-10-0045 announcing the process and requesting industry participation in the Department's initiative related to VA's 13 Greatest Challenges.  IAW FAR 15.202, the Government issued the pre-solicitation notice in order to establish strategic partnerships with industry to conquer the challenges faced by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as it transforms into a high-performing organization that is better aligned with 21st century Veterans and our responsibilities to deliver our Veterans the best possible support and services.   As specified in the original notice, the period for submission of concepts described below was open for a period of 1 year up to November 2, 2010.  Please be advised this amendment to the original notice specifies that the Government is not extending the period for submission of concept papers under the current competitive process described below and at VA Supplier Relationship Transformation website at http://www1.va.gov/oamm/transformation/index.cfm.  Concept paper submissions must be received at the VA Virtual Office of Acquisition (VOA) web site at https://www.voa.va.gov/ by 11:59PM on November 2, 2010 in order to be considered.  For those unfamiliar with the current process, the following provides the applicable details as included in the original notice.   Details regarding any subsequent process and associated details regarding opportunities to address VA's Greatest Challenges will be provided under a new Pre-Solicitation Notice.

The following 13 Greatest Challenges identified by the Department were included in the original Pre-solicitation Notice:

1.	  Eliminate Veteran Homelessness
2.	Enable 21st Century Benefits Delivery and Services (e.g. backlog reduction)
3.	Automate GI Bill Benefits
4.	Implement Virtual Lifetime Electronic Records (VLER)
5.	Improve Veterans Mental Health
6.	Build Veterans Relationship Management (VRM) Capability to Enable Convenient, Seamless Interactions
7.	Design a Veteran-Centric Healthcare Model and Right-Sized Infrastructure to Help Veterans Navigate the Healthcare Delivery System and Receive Coordinated Care
8.	Expand Healthcare Access for Veterans, Including Women and Rural Populations
9.	Ensure Preparedness to Meet Emergent National Needs (e.g. hurricanes, H1N1 virus)
10.	Develop Capabilities and Enabling Systems to Drive Performance and Outcomes 
11.	Establish Strong VA Management Infrastructure and Integrated Operating Model
12.	Transform Human Capital Management
13.	Perform Research and Development to Enhance the Long-Term Health and Well-Being of Veterans

Each challenge is described in greater detail on the following web site:  http://www.va.gov/oamm/transformation/ for more information on the VA's strategy to conquer these challenges, see the VA's Strategic Plan at http://www1.va.gov/op3/docs/VA_2006_2011_Strategic_Plan.pdf.   For more information on the budget resources planned to support these initiatives, see the FY 2010 budget highlights at http://www4.va.gov/budget/summary/2010/Fast_Facts_VA_Budget_Highlights.pdf .

Industry can submit their ideas as a "concept paper" as a short, three to five page document describing the proposed solution.  The concept papers must present solutions to systemic challenges, not technologies or approaches that address a narrow problem.   The concept papers shall be submitted electronically to the VA Virtual Office of Acquisition web portal at https://www.voa.va.gov/.   Subject matter experts from the VA and technical support staff from the Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research (MITRE) Corporation will conduct initial evaluations to determine which ideas/concepts have viability for further consideration.  Contractors who submit concept papers that warrant further consideration will be notified by e-mail and requested to provide additional technical information through an oral presentation, inclusive of briefing slides, and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate to support the proposed solution.  The Government reserves the right to utilize any information provided by industry via concept papers and any subsequent technical proposals, ROM cost estimate and oral presentations for purposes of future competitive acquisitions.  Concept papers that are not recommended for further consideration will be archived and the contractor will be notified in writing that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor on any subsequent acquisition.   Bid and proposal costs will not be reimbursed by the Government.

In addition to the challenges identified herein, industry is also encouraged to submit ideas for the improvement of VA processes not specifically identified above.  These proposals shall be submitted to the website at  https://www.voa.va.gov/ as Unsolicited Proposals and conform to the submission requirements and be evaluated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.6.

<DESC>The main supply header just inside of vault 148 has developed a failure within the vacuum jacketed pipe. This procurement is for the repair of that leak and the addition of expansion bellows to prevent future failure. Work consists of, but not limited to, removing existing stainless steel exterior pipe, insulation wrap, locating and repairing the leak, wrapping the pipe with insulation paper and foil, repairing the outer pipe, pulling a vacuum on the repaired section and then checking for leaks using a mass spectrometer. This is an emergency repair as this header section is connected to a 13,000 gallon external tank that is needed to maintain the animal and plant germplasm stored here.

<p>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, the Government intends to award the sole source contract modifications to Fluor, ERPMC, and NISTAC immediately.

<DESC>
1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The Department of Veterans Affairs Network VISN 22 Contracting Activity (NCA), 5901 East Seventh Street, Long Beach, CA 90822, has received a requirement to acquire service and maintenance for leased Olympus Medical Scopes and Related Equipment for the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 we seek to use other than full and open market competition procedures to procure these services with a single year purchase order. 

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  Negotiation shall be conducted to procure service and maintenance for leased Olympus Medical Scopes and Related equipment.  Circumstances require that this be done without the benefit of full and open competition.  The proposed contract vehicle shall be a Purchase Order.  Cost: $144650.76.

3. Description of Requirement:  VA Loma Linda Healthcare System requires thorough service and maintenance for Olympus Medical Scopes and Related Equipment.  This service and maintenance must comply with all current regulatory guidance under VHA Directive 2009-004 and VHA Handbook 1761.1.  
 
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  This request is pursuant to the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1(a).

5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:
A. FAR Part 6.302-1(a) allows for the procurement of items through other than full and open competition; applicable when the agency's minimum needs may only be satisfied by a service that is unique and available from only one responsible source.  The VA Loma Linda Healthcare System recently leased numerous Olympus Medical Scopes and Related Equipment as mandated under VHA Directive 2009-004.  As a requirement of this lease, all service and maintenance must be carried out by Olympus America to ensure that these products are still suitable for resale at the end of the lease period.  The use of any other contractor will effectively void the current lease which is not a suitable option due to VHA Directive 2009-004.  Thus Olympus America is the sole provider of these services due to their unique position as the only Federal Supply Schedule contractor with leasing options for Medical Scopes and Related Equipment.  Thus this requirement shall be awarded to Olympus America under FAR Part 6.302-1(a). 

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  A Notice shall be publicized and synopsized under requirements stated in FAR Part 5.

7. Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost of this procurement presented by Olympus American, Inc is fair and reasonable to the Government based on using service estimates and previous purchasing history of prices.

8. Results of Market Survey: In accordance with FAR Part 10 Market Research, various VA and Federal Supply Contracts were reviewed.  GSA and the internet were also researched.   Olympus American Corporation was the only one found to have a Federal Supply Contract in place for this type of leased scope equipment.  Also due to leasing requirements for the scopes and equipment themselves, market research indicates that generally the lessor is the only company capable of servicing and maintaining the leased equipment without voiding the lease.  

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  See Items 5 above.

10. Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that have expressed an interest to date.  


11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: At this time no alternatives exist as contracting officials have mandated the use of leased procurements for Medical Scopes and Related Equipment which in effect limits competition of service and maintenance agreements to the lessor.  Currently, there is only one contractor that offers leased Medical Scopes and Related Equipment within Federal Supply Schedules, once other contractors offer this leasing solution, there will be opportunity to procure service and maintenance agreements with other contractors and other Medical Scopes.


12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The Department of Veterans Affairs Network VISN 22 Contracting Activity (NCA), 5901 East Seventh Street, Long Beach, CA 90822, has received a requirement to lease Medical Scopes and Related Equipment signed by the Medical Service at VA Loma Linda Healthcare System.  In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(b)(1), FAR 8.402(f), and FAR 6.302-1 we seek to use limited sources on GSA and sole source open market items to create a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). 

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  Negotiation shall be conducted to procure a lease with Olympus American Incorporated.  Circumstances require that this be done without the benefit of full and open competition.  The proposed contract vehicle shall be a BPA based on Olympus American's current mandatory FSS schedule with a period of up to 3 years.  FSS: $1,094,919.87 and Open Market: $815,837.50; total: $1,910,757.37.

3. Description of Requirement:  VA Loma Linda Healthcare System requires the leased procurement of Olympus American Inc's medical scopes and related equipment.  The majority of the procurement can be purchased through the mandatory FSS schedule.  Though, approximately forty percent of the requirement shall require an open market purchase.  Olympus is the only known source that has a lease option on the Federal Supply Schedule for scopes and related equipment.  
 
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  This request is pursuant to the authority of FAR Part 8.405-6(b)1, FAR Part 8.402(f), and FAR Part 6.302-1(a).

5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:
A. Under 8.405-6(b)1, the use of limited sources procedures for FSS schedules may be used when only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work.  The VA Loma Linda requires the leasing of numerous medical scopes and related equipment for the gastroenterology department.  In the past, VA Loma Linda had simply purchased this equipment but due to standardization and technology demands, the VA Loma Linda must now lease their equipment.  Under VHA Directive 2009-004 and VHA Handbook 1761.1, VHA authority has mandated that standardization of equipment, processes and procedures be implemented immediately to ensure patient safety and health.  In addition, the April 19, 2010 Deputy Undersecretary for Health Operations and Management (DUSHOM)(10N) memo outlines guidance for VHA standardization of Endoscopes (WebCIMS No. 451818).  This memo states that the Integrated Product Team has deemed leasing to be the new level of standardization as it presents the VA the ability to standardize with greater efficiency, be flexible with new technology and accurately predict future maintenance costs.  Currently, Olympus is the only company that has an FSS schedule that allows for leasing of GI medical Scopes.  Pentax, its main competitor plans to bring leasing options to its FSS schedule, though it is unclear when this will occur or whether or not it will be successful.  Thus Olympus is the only source for this acquisition.
  B. Under 8.402(f), an ordering activity for convenience, may add items not on the Federal Supply Schedule to a BPA based off of an FSS contract under certain conditions.  1) The add-on must comply with all publicizing and competition requirements of the FAR, including FAR part 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, and 15.  In the interest of convenience these items should be added to this BPA pursuant to 8.402(f) and for the reasons stated below.
C. FAR Part 6.302-1(a) allows for the procurement of items through other than full and open competition; applicable when the agency's minimum needs may only be satisfied by a service that is unique and available from only one responsible source.  Many of the required scopes may only be purchased through open market procedures.  There are competing companies that can provide other scopes, but due to standardization requirements referenced above, only Olympus scopes can be purchased due to their leasing options. The requirement shall be posted as other than full and open competition which will not allow other contractors to reply to the solicitation.  Significant market research has shown that only Olympus is able to provide all of these scopes to the Government with required leasing options.   Since Olympus is the only contractor to provide leasing for these scopes, they offer a truly unique product as the sole responsible source.  Even though in the future other companies may create leasing options within their FSS schedules, the Government can only evaluate what is currently present.  Thus the add-on open market medical scopes should be added to this BPA under other than full and open competition procedures in conjunction with 8.402(f).   

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  A Notice shall be publicized and synopsized under requirements stated in FAR Part 5.

7. Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost of this procurement presented by Olympus American, Inc is fair and reasonable to the Government based on using service estimates and previous purchasing history of prices.

8. Results of Market Survey: In accordance with FAR Part 10 Market Research, various VA and Federal Supply Contracts were reviewed.  GSA and the internet were also researched.   Olympus American Corporation was the only one found to have a Federal Supply Contract in place for this type of leased scope equipment.  Furthermore, VA Loma Linda must standardize their equipment according to VHA Directive 2009-004 and VHA Handbook 1761.1.

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  See Items 5 above.

10. Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that have expressed an interest to date.  


11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: Alternate sources have been given consideration.  This procurement involves changing technology in scope procurements and maintenance.  Future requirements for this service cannot be accurately predicated at this time.  In addition, this procurement shall be in the form of a Blanket Purchase Agreement, should a future contractor pose better pricing and exceptional lease terms, the Government may always opt out the proposed BPA and create a new BPA with other contractors to fulfill this need.


12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
