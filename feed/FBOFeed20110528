<p><br />The Center for Neutron Research at NIST owns a custom-designed Oxford Instruments superconducting magnet / dilution refrigerator system which was purchased in 2002. It is an integral system consisting of a cryostat, dilution refrigerator, and superconducting magnet.</p>
<p>Due to numerous failing and damaged components (including oil contamination of the automatic gas handling system, failure of needle valves in the cryostat, damage to the attachment point of the drive motor, a worn sample mount and loading probe, and problems with the superconducting magnet power supply) a total refurbishment of the system is necessary.</p>
<p>In its current state, the system has become unreliable, which has severely limited the use of the system and has caused significant disruption to planned experiments. The refurbishment will consist of replacement of core, application specific components for the system that have degraded and become contaminated in the years since the system was originally delivered. The required components are either custom-made by Oxford Instruments for this specific piece of equipment or are proprietary to Oxford Instruments.</p>
<p>The overall complexity of this custom-designed Oxford Instruments superconducting magnet / dilution refrigerator system necessitates an extremely detailed and intricate knowledge of the system and its components in order to effectively refurbish the instrument and restore it to OEM specifications.</p>
<p>Oxford Instruments is the only authorized source of proprietary parts and technical support for the refurbishment of this instrument. Resources to meet these stated requirements can only be obtained by working with the original manufacturer of the equipment, as they do not license or provide access to other companies.</p>
<p>Oxford Instruments is the only contractor who can provide the required refurbishment and proprietary parts for NIST's custom-designed superconducting magnet / dilution refrigerator system. The technology and parts for the system are proprietary, and are not available to other companies. No other vendor is authorized to refurbish, maintain, or service this Oxford Instruments system.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (Eastern) on June 13, 2011. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<p>(end of provision)</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the contractor shall be a small business under the applicable size standard and shall provide either its own product or that of another domestic small business manufacturing or processing concern. See FAR 19.102(f) for additional information.</p>
<p>All offerors shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p><br />Line Item 0001: One (1) Multi-pocket Electron Gun Deposition System</p>
<p><br />Introduction</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, and equipment to manufacture and deliver a multi-pocket electron gun deposition system.</p>
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>The Atomic Physics Division of NIST's Physical Measurement Laboratory has a requirement for a multi-pocket electron gun deposition system. The required multi-pocket electron gun deposition system shall have the ability to select and independently deposit at least 4 different materials from isolated pockets.</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements</p>
<p>The multi-pocket electron gun deposition system shall meet or exceed the technical specifications below. All items must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>1. System shall be UHV compatible and shall not incorporate any elastomers, i.e., capable of base pressures of &lt;5 x 10-11 Torr.<br /><br />2. Crucible system shall have at least four different pockets, each of which shall have at least 6 cc of volume. Stronger consideration will be given to systems that offer additional numbers of pockets and/or larger volumes, as these features add value.<br /><br />3. The pockets shall have a geometry that is compatible with a readily available crucible liner. <br /><br />4. Glassy coated graphite crucible liners shall be provided for at least twice the number of pockets in the electron. <br /><br />5. Two mounting options are acceptable for the electron gun: horizontal (crucible axis at 90 degrees relative to mounting flange axis) with the crucible center 12" from the flange face OR vertical (crucible axis collinear with mounting flange axis) with the crucible center within 1" of the flange axis. The multi-pocket electron gun shall be mounted on a 10" Conflat non-rotatable flange and shall be able to be installed into the vacuum chamber within a cross section of a 7.75" diameter circle. A vertically mounted electron gun solution will be installed on a port that is 10 degrees from the gravitation axis and shall be robust against this tilting. Note: the gun will still be mounted "normal" on the flange, but the flange will be tilted on the chamber (Chamber drawings available upon request.)</p>
<p>6. The electron gun shall have in situ water cooling and be such that the flow rate can be accomplished with an inlet water pressure differential that is &lt; 45 psi. <br /><br />7. The electron gun shall be constructed such that the source filament is a user replaceable element and shall generate a spot size that is ~1 mm^2. <br /><br />8. Electron gun filament shall be shielded from the evaporant.</p>
<p>9. The system shall be capable of delivering 6 kW of total power to the crucible, shall provide sweeping capability, and shall be compatible with future switching between different in vacuum electron gun systems. <br /><br />10. The high voltage ripple shall be &lt;1%.</p>
<p>11. Automatic indexing capability shall be included for compatibility with future global deposition control. <br /><br />12. Cable lengths between source flange and the power supply and control components shall be at least 3 meters in length to allow the latter components to be located away from the chamber.<br /><br />13. Similarly, any remote control paddles or hand-held operational devices shall have at least 4 m cable connections.<br /><br />14. The electron gun mount flange shall be fitted with guide rods or some other mechanical assistance system to maintain electron gun angular alignment and coaxial alignment with the chamber flange to aid in mounting and demounting of electron gun for replenishment or service operations.<br /><br />15. Electron gun control systems shall be capable of interfacing with a process controller for automated thin film growth and switching between different materials.</p>
<p>Express Warranty</p>
<p>Contractor shall provide a standard commercial warranty.</p>
<p>Delivery</p>
<p>FOB Destination delivery terms are requested, and shall take place within the contractor's commercial schedule. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>

<p>Addendum to FAR 52.212-1, Quotation Preparation Instructions</p>
<p>1) Price Quotation: The offeror shall submit an original and one copy of the completed price schedule. If the quotation is submitted electronically, additional copies are not required. The pricing quotation shall be separate from any other portion of the quotation. The offeror should propose a firm-fixed-price, FOB Destination, for each CLIN. Contractor shall state express warranty coverage. Price quotations shall remain valid for a period of 90 days from the date quotations are due.<br />2) Technical Quotation: The offeror shall submit an original and one copy of the technical quotation. If the quotation is submitted electronically, additional copies are not required. The technical quotation shall address the following: <br />Technical Capability: The offeror shall submit a technical description or product literature for the equipment it is proposing, which clearly identifies the manufacturer, make and model. The offeror must demonstrate that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds each minimum requirement described in the statement of work by providing a citation to the relevant section of its technical description or product literature. If applicable, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation should be included. The Offerors shall acknowledge that NIST will not store the equipment onsite before it is installed.</p>
<p>3) Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>
<p>Acceptance of Terms and Conditions: This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein. The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein. The quotation should include one of the following statements:</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements. NIST will give stronger preference to offerors whose quoted equipment exceeds minimum requirement 2.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p><br />Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Experience, Past Performance, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

<CONTACT>Morgan Reese 202 781 3951 Morgan Reese, Procuring Contracting Officer, SEA 02441, (202)781-3951, morgan.reese@navy.mil.
<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement in accordance with FAR 15.201 and in anticipation of a potential future procurement program. The Naval Sea Systems Command is conducting market research to determine industry capability and interest in performing non-dry-docking maintenance, repair, and alterations of DDG-51 and FFG-7 Class vessels home ported and visiting Everett, Washington. The Naval Sea Systems Command is especially interested in determining small business capability and interest in performing non-dry-docking maintenance, repair, and alterations of DDG-51 and FFG-7 Class vessels home ported and visiting Everett, Washington. The Government is seeking responses from sources that can perform non-dry-docking maintenance, repair, and alterations of DDG-51 and FFG-7 Class vessels home ported and visiting Everett, Washington, beginning at contract award (anticipated late Fall 2011) and continuing for a period of performance of 5 years.
 

NAVSEA intends to procure execution planning, ship repair, modernization, and inter-availability maintenance (continuous and emergent maintenance) of DDG and FFG ship classes in the homeport of Everett, Washington, utilizing Multi-Ship Multi-Option (MSMO) contracting.  MSMO contracts target efficient and effective maintenance practices. These contracts allow the executing agency the ability to better plan its work and take advantage of best repair capabilities.  MSMO contracts will provide long-term vendor relationships throughout ships' training/ deployment/ maintenance/ modernization cycles.  In order to reduce costs through the benefits of advanced planning, MSMO contracts allow the contractor to respond to continuous and emergent maintenance requirements on short notice, and as the contractor is intimately involved with both the planning and execution, less time is spent evaluating prospective jobs.
 The MSMO contractor can also respond on short notice to voyage repairs required on deployed ships, giving the Navy the option of using the homeport based contractors vice a foreign source, if needed. MSMO contracts will be repair and overhaul contracts for an entire ship class awarded to a prime contractor for a base plus several option years. The MSMO contract provides continuity for planning and maintenance processes for Navy ships and private sector teams awarded the work.

The Government has provided the following information as attachments to this sources sought announcement:
1.	The draft solicitation statement of work.
2.	A representative sample of standard work items completed under past DDG-51 and FFG-7 Class availabilities, highlighting the type of work that may be completed under future availabilities.
 
 

Interested companies should submit, on company letterhead, a notice of interest including the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of one point of contact to Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Morgan Reese SEA 02441. Please scan your letter of interest and e-mail it to Morgan.reese@navy.mil with “Pacific Northwest DDG-51 and FFG-7 MSMO Sources Sought Response” in the subject field. The notice of interest should include a brief description of your company and its capabilities as they relate to the requirements set forth on this announcement, and answers to the following specific questions. Please limit your response to no more than 10 pages. 

1.	Is your company a small or large business as defined by the Small Business Administration(SBA)?
2.	How many employees does your company have?
3.	Does your company have a website? If so, what is your company’s website address?
4.	Is your company a NAVSEA certified Master Ship Repair Contractor (MSRA)?
5.	Is your company a NAVSEA certified Boat Repair Contractor (ABR)?

6.	Strategic Planning/Program Management.
  Strategic Planning/Program Management plays a critical role in MSMO contracts due the overlapping of execution planning events, conducting Selected Restricted Availabilities (SRAs), inter-availabilities (both CM/EM) and visiting DDGs/FFGs that could potentially require repair/maintenance at a moment’s notice. The MSMO prime plays an important role in the maintenance and modernization of the surface Navy because the MSMO contract is considered a partnership between the Navy and the prime.  The MSMO prime is expected to become subject matter experts on the ships in the homeport. What is your company’s experience/strategy in managing/executing several comprehensive/technically challenging maintenance and repair activities simultaneously?   

7.	Surge Capacity.
  The MSMO prime is expected to have surge capacity due to flex in operational schedules of the Navy.  On short notice, any ship could require repair/maintenance and the MSMO prime would be expected to be there and support.  It is not uncommon for MSMO primes to have teaming partners to handle such needs.  In other words, management responsiveness is essential for success as MSMO prime. What is your company’s strategy for surge/emergent requirements?

8.	Integration.  Integration strategy is a key role of the MSMO prime.  The MSMO prime is expected to work with many different vendors, sub contractors and customers to ensure a successful SRA and ability to provide a high quality product through sound Engineering practices, technical expertise and PM.
 They are expected to work with Alternation Installation Teams (AITs) so the prime understands the support requirements such as power, lighting or ventilation and that work must be integrated into the master schedule.  The MSMO prime will need to integrate schedules with customers such as Type Commander (TYCOM), Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), ship’s force, and I-level work etc.  All work must be properly scheduled and managed.  Need to have a sound plan for managing subcontracts as well. What is your company’s integration strategy, especially in regard to managing sub-contractors?

9.	Accounting Methodology.  Sound financial tools and practices such as a certified accounting system, EVMS reporting, interface/approval with DCAA and approved purchasing systems are required to adequately provide proper billing to the Navy.
  The accounting system would show the breakout of direct, indirect and overhead charges.  In addition, the accounting system would used to manage the business with vendors as required.  While it is important to have an integrated schedule; it is equally important to have cost controls in place. The MSMO will submit timely invoices/vouchers to the Navy by Contract Line Item (CLIN), Contract Subline Item (SLIN), and ACRN level.  Cost of performance shall be segregated, accumulated, and invoiced to the appropriate ACRN categories.  What accounting system and other best practice accounting methodology does your company currently use?

10.	Logistic Support/Sustainment.  The MSMO prime needs to understand Logistic Support/Sustainment.
  All repairs, maintenance and modernization have Integrated Logistic Support (ILS).  This means the ship and Navy receives the proper technical documents after upgrades have occurred and respond accurately and timely to the volume of Contractor Data Requirements List (CDRLs). What is your company’s experience with ILS?  

11.	Given the complexity of the work described in this sources sought, including attachments 1 and 2, please describe your company’s historical experience completing work of this complexity or briefly describe how your company would be capable of meeting the requirements described herein as of contract award. 

12.	Given the complexity of the work described in this sources sought, does your company plan to submit a proposal in response to the anticipated solicitation for non-dry-docking maintenance, repair, and alterations of DDG-51 and FFG-7 Class vessels home ported and visiting Everett, Washington?
