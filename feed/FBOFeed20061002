PeARL is a quick reaction procurement/fabrication for an imaging system being prepared for immediate duty in Iraq.  The WulfPacks provide all PeARL computational functions, to include control of cameras, real time processing of terraBytes of imagery to identify IED that are immediate danger to our troops, and formatting/transfer of the reduced data to our troops. For this information to be timely, all computations must be performed real-time on the OIF platform being fielded by the PMO ARL office. After conducting an extensive Market Survey and designing/fabricating/testing/and flying candidate dual core, dual processor assemblies, it was determined that only one Processor Assembly, the IBASE MB899F Assembly, satisfied the unique requirements of highly parallel cluster computing of 80 processors in an aircraft environment.

<DESC>NOTICE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION (NOPCA).  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The U.S. Air Force Identification Friend or Foe Mode 5 Cryptographic Program Management Office (PMO) intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with BAE Systems Information and Electronic Systems Integration, Incorporated, Greenlawn, NY, for the modification and upgrade of the Mode 5 capable AN/APX-113(V) Combined Interrogator Transponder (CIT) and the KIV-78 Combined Interrogator Transponder Appliqué (CITA), NSN 5810-01-539-3414CA and P/N 0N706722.  The modifications and upgrades include the addition of Type B key management capabilities and a change to the capability to manage interrogations using Mode 4 A/B pairs.  The task also includes the integration and test of the upgraded CIT/CITA to achieve NSA Type 1 certification as well as LRU and box-level DoD AIMS certification.  The requirement is to complete the upgrades, achieve NSA certification for the KIV-78, and merge these  capabilities with the baseline CIT/CITA System Development & Demonstration effort in sufficient time to achieve box-level DoD AIMS certification prior to the KIV-78 Q1 FY 2008 Milestone C decision.  This effort must be completed concurrently with the baseline CIT/CITA System Development & Demonstration effort and requires access to the baseline CIT/CITA system software, design, documentation, and other data necessary to complete this task.  Other anticipated tasks include the development of operator and maintenance training courseware, modification of KIV-78 markings to support Government Unique Identification requirements, delivery of additional copies of NSA-signed operational software for the KIV-78, and the delivery of KIV-78 drawings and technical data with appropriate data rights.  The IFF Mode 5 Crypto PMO intends to procure under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) Only One  Responsible Source, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  BAE Systems is the current developer and integrator of the CIT and CITA and is the only contractor that possesses the requisite in-depth technical expertise as well as the experience and capability in crypto development, demonstration, and acceptance to meet the Government’s requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  If any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities must be submitted in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  The statement of capability must also address eligibility and ability to handle COMSEC information and materials at the SECRET/NOFORN level.   Proprietary information, if any, should be appropriately marked.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on the responses to this notice nor otherwise pay for preparing any information sent in response to this notice.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Sharon Taylor, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-322-8258, Fax 757-322-8285, Email sharon.taylor@navy.mil
<DESC>This is a Design/Build Best Value Source Selection solicitation to provide the design and construction of six FY?07 projects and seven FY?08 projects, consisting of 34 new structures comprising nearly 1 million square feet.  These projects will construct the necessary administrative/headquarters, operational/maintenance/mission support, training and housing facilities to support the 1,950 +/? MARSOC Marines to be stationed at Stone Bay.  These projects will also construct necessary community support facilities for both MARSOC personnel as well as other USMC personnel stationed aboard Stone Bay.  These projects will also construct the necessary supporting facilities, including demolition and site clearing, pavements and other site improvements, grading and drainage, and utilities necessary to support the MARSOC mission.  Upgrades to local utilities include potable water, sanitary sewer, LP gas, electrical power and telecommunications.

The projects will be located at Stone Bay, an ancillary installation of MCB Camp Lejeune on the west side of the New River, which is currently home for the Weapons Training Battalion and its rifle qualifying ranges, as well as the Special Operations Training Group (SOTG), which trains MEU-deployable elements.  The existing facilities at Stone Bay are nested far inside the installation, accessed via Rifle Range Road, which extends off of Route 210.  The new MARSOC facilities shall occupy land closer to the main entrance of Stone Bay.  The work includes realigning Rifle Range Road around the MARSOC compound in order to flow existing and future traffic around the MARSOC site rather than through it.

The nucleus of the MARSOC compound shall consist of a campus-arranged Headquarters Building and flanking Intel Facility and Academic Instruction Building, overlooking a prominent parade field.  Operations, maintenance and mission-support facilities are accessed nearby to the south, with housing and community facilities arranged to the north.  Training ranges, including live-fire facilities, are positioned remotely, farther south.  All facilities except for the BEQs and community facilities shall be secured behind a new, access-controlled fenceline.  POV parking is located throughout the secure compound and in proximity to new facilities outside the fenceline.  Parking for tactical vehicles and boats inside the secure compound near a proposed base tactical fueling station.  A new boat launch and pier to support MARSOC?s small craft mission is located on the New River.  

The proposed layout of new facilities and pavements is configured to avoid low-lying ravines and embankments.  Some filling of upland ditches and lower elevations will be required to provide sufficient contiguous land for the required facilities; however, the fill, and consequential impact on delineated wetlands, has been minimized.  New facilities and pavement areas are configured in conformance with standoffs under current AT/FP criteria.

Site improvements include pavements, turf and landscaping, and construction of various training apparatus such as an obstacle course.  Site lighting shall be provided throughout the MARSOC complex and along the realigned Rifle Range Road.  A new perimeter fence shall encircle the secure enclave, and a gravel road shall be provided around the site to permit inspection and maintenance of the fence.  A helipad shall be provided at the parade field, and an existing tactical landing zone (TLZ ?Owl?) shall be expanded to suit four aircraft on the ground.  The proposed MARSOC compound layout has been designed to accommodate future expansion to the south and west, over the existing Base entrance road.  

Utilities include LP gas to support heating requirements at new facilities using LP gas-fired boilers or direct-fired equipment.  Air-conditioning shall be accomplished by air- and water-cooled chillers at larger facilities, and heat pumps at smaller facilities.  

Potable water shall be obtained from the local water authority and is available in adequate supply at the installation?s main entrance.  Water shall be fed to the existing 250,000 gallon elevated water tank at Stone Bay.  Water for fire suppression shall be distributed from fire hydrants and to sprinkler systems inside of buildings.  Fire pumps shall be included around the site to upgrade flow and pressure due to building height or fire flow demand.

Sanitary sewer work shall include connecting a new (existing) 12-inch force main near Rt. 210 to the new collection system provided by these projects.  Existing Stone Bay service will also be connected to the new collection system.

Electrical power shall be obtained from the Jones/Onslow Power Company, and is available in abundant supply from an existing switch outside the Stone Bay main gate.  Power lines inside Stone Bay must be re-fed from this switch along the realigned Rifle Range road and distributed to both new and existing facilities.  All power distribution shall be overhead, except where it must be run in underground ductbank at the Headquarters and Parade field due the helipad.

Telecommunications work shall include construction of a new switch and telephone exchange building next to existing Building RR110.  The existing SONET ring loop feeding Building RR110, will be relocated along the new Rifle Range Road and spliced at a location near to the existing gate house.  From the upgraded switch facility, new telecommunications cabling, both copper and fiber, shall be distributed to new and existing facilities via underground ductbank and manholes.  Secure (classified) systems shall be segregated from non-secure ductbanks and manholes.

The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, engineering, materials, equipment, tools, parts, supplies, and transportation to perform all of the services described in the plans and specifications. 

The approximate Solicitation Release Date is 09 November 2006.  This solicitation is available in electronic format only.  All documents will be in the Adobe Acrobat PDF file format via the Internet.  The free Acrobat Reader, required to view the PDF files, can be downloaded from the Adobe website.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the continued development of Trick Simulation modeling and facility support, MAGIK software development, intelligent software for learning technologies and onboard applications, spacecraft training and avionics simulation development, on-board training system development, advanced guidance, navigation and control engineering support, vehicle system management software development, systems engineering analyses, and distributed simulation development. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from L3 Communications Titan Corporation.  L3 Communications Titan Corporation is the architect and developer of the Trick Simulation Environment, Virtual Reality Lab and MAGIK software, and possesses unique capabilities and expertise with the required software suite.  L3 Communications Titan Corporation is the current provider of these services to NASA/JSC under a contract with a five-year period of performance ending April 30, 2007.   Due to unforeseen program requirements, additional indefinite-delivery-indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) work is required.  As such, it is necessary to increase the IDIQ maximum value and to extend the period of performance beyond the original period of performance.  A follow-on contract is currently in the process of being recompeted; however, it is anticipated that this process will not be completed until Fall of 2007.  The schedule required for a competitive selection for the interim provision of services would result in unacceptable costs and delays to the Government.  Extending the Trick Simulation Software and Virtual Reality Laboratory contract to bridge the gap between when the current contract ends and when the follow-on is awarded will (a) enable the contractor to maintain their current level of mission-critical support, and (b) remove any potential adverse impacts to the Government due to a lapse in services to the NASA Johnson Space Center's Automation, Robotics, and Simulation Division.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 17, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<RESPDATE>012406
<CONTACT>NATALIA FISHER-JACKSON, Contract Specialist, Phone: (919) 541-3564 , E-Mail: fisher-jackson.natalia@epa.gov
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to provide support for NATA and Risk Assessment Activities within the Integrated Air Program.  The EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  This component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA?s Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics initiative. The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales, ranging from national-scale to local-scale assessments.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach.   One of the purposes of this contract is to provide support for risk assessment activities associated with the first component of EPA?s air toxics program.  Within the context of this component, EPA evaluates the effects of hazardous and potentially hazardous air pollutants and develops appropriate regulatory strategies. In this role, EPA:  (1) identifies, screens, and characterizes air pollutants to determine which should be evaluated further as candidates for being listed as hazardous;  (2) reviews and evaluates health and/or ecological assessment documents on hazardous air pollutants; (3) performs risk assessments using EPA methods and models, or other methods and/or models if more appropriate to help guide reasoned decision-making; (4) identifies and evaluates alternative control options; (5) gathers information on production, use, emissions, control technology, control cost, and regulatory status to establish appropriate regulatory development priorities; (6) assesses the effectiveness of EPA and State/local programs in controlling hazardous and criteria pollutants; and (7) coordinates with other EPA offices and Federal and State/local programs to develop appropriate single or multimedia (e.g.,  air, water, solid waste, and/or other media) regulations. 	Another purpose of this contract is to provide support for the second, third, and fourth components of EPA?s air toxics program.  This will be accomplished by developing assessment tools, conducting assessments, communicating the results of assessments, and educating the public.  In addition, as EPA moves forward with its air program, the EPA will be examining the air pollution problem in a more integrated fashion (i.e., considering the cumulative effects of air toxics and criteria pollutants across media rather than conducting separate assessments).  This contract will also provide support for these integrated assessments.  EPA anticipates the award of two cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contract with a base period of performance of twelve (12) months, with four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.   The total duration of the proposed contracts is sixty (60) months.  The first contract, will be awarded on the basis of full and open competition which will consist of 5,100 base quantity labor hours and 15,300 optional quantity labor hours for each of the five (5) periods, for a total contract maximum of 102,000 labor hours.  The second contract, will be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside which will consist of 5,100 base quantity labor hours and 15,300 optional quantity labor hours for each of the five (5) periods, for a total contract maximum of 102,000 labor hours.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620  with a size standard of 6.5 million.  This is an invitation to participate in a pre-solicitation conference.    The purpose of the conference is to provide background information concerning the Statement of Work (SOW) to potential offerors and to create an open forum for discussions concerning the objectives of the project.  Any and all questions submitted should be directly related to the DRAFT SOW and technical evaluation criteria.  There will be no discussion of budget at the conference or any other subject matter that does not directly pertain to the DRAFT SOW or technical evaluation criteria.  Both the draft statement of work and evaluation factors are available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  The conference will be held on January 31, 2006 from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM in the Raleigh/Durham area.  Specific location information will be provided upon your confirmation of attendance to the conference, which must occur by 12:00 P.M. (EST) on Jan 24, 2006 via email to Natalia Fisher-Jackson at fisher-jackson.natalia@epa.gov.  Telephone confirmations are not acceptable for this procurement.   Pre-solicitation conference attendance is limited to two (2) individuals that best represent the prospective offeror's company.  Any questions and/or comments that you would prefer not to discuss in a group format due to proprietary reasons should be submitted in writing to Natalia Fisher Jackson via email no later than January 23, 2006 and explicitly labeled ?proprietary?.   EPA handling of such questions/comments and subsequent responses will be handled in accordance with normal agency procedures for protection of proprietary data.  There will be NO reimbursement for travel expenses related to the participation in the pre-solicitation conference.  All responses to questions/comments concerning the DRAFT SOW and technical evaluation criteria discussed at the pre-solicitation conference and not deemed proprietary will be compiled and distributed to all interested parties.  The RFP will be issued approximately March 6, 2006 and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date.  The solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.   If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments. The Government is not obligated or committed to award any contract as a result of this notice.

<DESC>Background:
The Office of Advocacy is charged with documenting business ownership statistics for various owner demographics, including minorities, women, veterans, and service-disabled veterans.  Over the years, we have conducted a variety of studies on this subject.  For example, see http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/demographic.html.

The Office of Advocacy is interested in expanding its knowledge in this area with a research project that would examine issues related to business ownership and owner demographics.  Various data sources might be used, including the Survey of Business Owners, the Current Population Survey, Statistics of Income, and others. It would also be of interest to examine barriers that might prevent these groups from starting or growing their businesses?  Why, for instance, do some groups lag behind their peers in terms of business ownership, or conversely, why are other groups more successful?  How does this affect the economic well-being of such groups? Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.  No questions after July 14, 2006.  Questions MUST be emailed to the Contracting Specialist (brenda.mealer@sba.gov).  Fax or email proposals will not be accepted.  Please provide the RFQ number in the subject line of your email for questions.  NOTE:  THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100 PERCENT SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

<SUBJECT>B -- RESEARCH ON SMALL BUSINESS BENEFITS
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-06-Q-0008
<RESPDATE>072706
<CONTACT>Maria Manga, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 205-7036, Fax (202) 481-4324, Email maria.manga@sba.gov
<DESC>Background:
In August 2005, the Office of Advocacy released a study on small business benefits that reached the following conclusion (http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs224tot.pdf): 

Employees of small businesses have access to fewer benefits than do the employees of large businesses. Small and large businesses continue to provide benefits to their employees, but at a declining rate. Companies of all sizes have reduced the availability of health insurance to their employees due to the increasing cost associated with benefits in recent years. Access to retirement benefits is more prevalent among large firms than among small firms.

The Office of Advocacy has conducted many studies on this topic (http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/wages.html). Small firms continue to be squeezed by higher health insurance premiums, as evidenced by annual surveys from the Kaiser Family Foundation (http://www.kff.org/insurance/7315/index.cfm), and small business owners continue to cite the cost and availability of insurance as the single most important problem that they face in the monthly Small Business Economic Trends published by the National Federation of Independent Business (for more information, see http://www.nfib.com/page/researchFoundation). Firms have reacted to rising health care costs in different ways.  Many are beginning to offer high deductible health plans (HDHP) coupled with a health savings account (HSA) as a method of using consumer-driven options to control costs.  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, more large firms than small firms are the early adopters of these HDHP’s and HSA's, which were created by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Because these types of plans are relatively new, data are just beginning to emerge on their usage.  (Another source of information on these and other plans is America’s Health Insurance Plans, which can be found at http://www.ahipresearch.org.) 

In terms of retirement plans, small firms are more likely to have defined-contribution versus defined-benefit plans. Yet, rising health care costs can mean that some small business owners must choose between providing their workers with health insurance or making contributions to their employee’s retirement savings plan. Providing such benefits can be essential to attracting qualified workers, especially as these smaller entities compete for labor with their larger counterparts.

The Office of Advocacy seeks additional research in the area of small business benefits. Proposals could focus on health care, retirement, or some other form of employee compensation or benefit, and they should focus on data sources that contain firm-size information. (This is preferable to establishment-size data.)  Possible data sources include, but are not limited to: the Current Population Survey, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, and the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.     No questions after July 14, 2006.     Questions MUST be email to the Contracting Specialist (maria.manga@sba.gov). Fax or email proposals will not be accepted. Please provide the RFQ number in the subject line of your email for questions. NOTE:THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100 PERCENT SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

<SUBJECT>B -- ANTITRUST AND SMALL BUSINESS RESEARCH
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-06-Q-0009
<RESPDATE>072706
<CONTACT>Maria Manga, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 205-7036, Fax (202) 481-4324, Email maria.manga@sba.gov
<DESC>Background:  
Small/new businesses are an integral component to the U.S. competitive marketplace.  Antitrust laws strive to allow for competition.  Advocacy seeks research to evaluate how the application of antitrust laws, mergers and/or court cases has affected small businesses and potential entrants in the past decade or so.

One avenue of study could be creating a competition/concentration of industry model with mergers/antitrust court cases as dependent variable(s).  Other avenues of study include creating an entrant or small business performance model with mergers/antitrust court cases as dependent variable(s) or modeling the impact of a specific antitrust case on small businesses.  Note that the models will need to capture the “natural” evolutions of industries, such as controlling for technological changes and demand for goods and services.  (Researchers will need to show their proficiency in creating econometric models and familiarity with the data presented in their proposals.)

The proposals need to specify the data and models to be used for the scientific research sought.  In addition to others, firm size data from the U.S. Census Bureau (http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/data.html),  firm size data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/bdm/home.htm) or information on publicly traded companies that track large publicly traded company characteristics or initial public offerings by industry are options.   Information from the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), such as FTC’s “Horizontal Merger Investigation Data, Fiscal Years 1996-2003” http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/02/horizmerger.htm could help guide proposals. 
 
The study could focus on the entire economy or a few select industries.  If individual industries are to be studied, overall findings should be applicable to other portions of the economy. 

As a side note, the federal government is showing interest in refreshing antitrust laws.  Legislation in 2002 created the “Antitrust Modernization Commission” (http://www.amc.gov/) to examine and solicit input into antitrust laws.  Work groups and meetings are currently being held and a report from this group is expected in mid-2007.

Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.     No questions after July 14, 2006.     Questions MUST be email to the Contracting Specialist (maria.manga@sba.gov).     Fax or email proposals will not be accepted.     Please provide the RFQ number in the subject line of your email for questions.     NOTE:     THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100 PERCENT SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

<SUBJECT>B -- THE IMPACT OF ENERGY PRICES ON SMALL BUSINESS
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-06-Q-0010
<RESPDATE>072706
<CONTACT>Maria Manga, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 205-7036, Fax (202) 481-4324, Email maria.manga@sba.gov
<DESC>Background:
Small businesses that rely heavily upon energy inputs are in a particularly difficult position when energy prices increase sharply, at least when compared to their larger counterparts.  Small firms generally do not have the economies of scale to ameliorate the costs of inputs that are at least somewhat fixed, such as electricity for plant operations or fuel for deliveries.  Thus when energy prices rise, small businesses face decreasing profits and increasing uncertainty.

Because of rising world demand, sustained increases in energy prices, including gas, natural gas, and electricity, are expected to prevail into the foreseeable future and small businesses will be forced to confront this issue.  Regardless of industry, energy prices have some impact on a firm’s costs.  However, some industries will be impacted to a greater extent than others, and small businesses are not equally distributed across industries.  This research should address these issues in determining what impact elevated energy prices will have on small business.  Geographic differences in energy prices will also be important, especially with regard to electricity and natural gas.  The effects of government regulation, both of the energy markets directly and through environmental requirements, might also be considered as important factors driving small business impacts, especially with respect to geographic differences.

The Office of Advocacy seeks research proposals to study the effect of rising energy prices on small business.  A proposal should carefully document the methodology and data to be employed in the investigation.  Preference will be given to proposals with a clear research agenda, familiarity with both small business economics and the energy sector, and well documented policy relevance.
Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.     No questions after July 14, 2006.     Questions MUST be email to the Contracting Specialist (maria.manga@sba.gov).     Fax or email proposals will not be accepted.     Please provide the RFQ number in the subject line of your email for questions.     NOTE:     THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100 PERCENT SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

<SUBJECT>B -- RESEARCH ON HUMAN CAPITAL AND BUSINESS OWNERSHIP BY DEMOGRAPHICS
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-06-Q-0011
<RESPDATE>062606
<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Background:
According to Wikipedia, human capital is defined as “a way of defining and categorizing peoples' skills and abilities as used in employment and otherwise contribute to the economy.” People improve their human capital through education and participation in the marketplace where others boost up their technological and managerial know-how. 

The drastic increase in women business ownership exemplifies women’s swelling human capital that has been the bedrock for women’s financial independence and economic prosperity. Two recent research projects highlight the importance of this topic – “The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s Employment, Education, and Family” by Claudia Goldin (http://www.nber.org/papers/w11953) and Enterprising Women: 250 Years of American Business by Virginia Drachman (http://uncpress.unc.edu/books/t-7028.html). 

The proposed study must define human capital, find data or proxy to measure the stock of women’s human capital, and analyze how the growth of women human capital correlate with the growth of business ownership. Moreover, it would also compare and contrast these findings with results from other groups, such as men and minorities.

Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.  No questions after July 14, 2006.

<SUBJECT>B -- THE IMPACK OF HUBZONE QUALIFIED AREAS ON SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND JOB CREATION
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-06-Q-0012
<RESPDATE>072706
<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Background:  The HUBZone Act of 1997, Title VI of Public Law 105-135, enacted on December 2, 1997 (111 Stat. 2592), created the HUBZone Empowerment Contracting Program (hereinafter “the HUBZone Program). 
Public Law 108-447 requires the Office of Advocacy to review the HUBZone program and provide Congress with the study by May 1, 2008.  More specifically, The Office of Advocacy is charged with the task of measuring the effectiveness of the definitions under Section 3(p)(4) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(p)(4)) for the purposes of economic impact on small business development and job creation.

The Small Business Administration (SBA) produced a report to Congress in 2002 that evaluated the HUBZone program (https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/general/library.cfm#2).

The Office of Advocacy seeks proposals to fulfill this task, with the understanding that the winning bidder will need to demonstrate practical knowledge of the HUBZone program.  Data will be available from the HUBZone Program (https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/) at the SBA in coordination with the Office of Advocacy. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006.  No questions after July 14, 2006.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting Specialist (brenda.mealer@sba.gov).  Fax or email proposals will not be accepted.  Please provide the RFQ number in the subject line of your email for questions.  NOTE:  THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100 PERCENT SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Purpose: With the availability of the 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances by the Federal Reserve Board this summer, the Office of Advocacy seeks projects that use the databases (for years 1987, 1993, 1998, and 2003) to increase the state of knowledge about the availability and the uses of debt and equity capital by small business, and the government’s role and policies that affect small firms. Depending on technical merit, policy relevance and costs, the Office may award more than one contract in this topic area. NOTE:  THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100% SET A-SIDE  FOR SMALL BUSINESS.  

Availability of large nationally representative statistical databases on small business financing allows researchers to experiment innovative methodologies to test interesting hypotheses related to small business financing behaviors of lenders and borrowers. The proposal shall describe hypotheses about the availability or uses of different financing sources, over time, by small firms or by certain demographic groups of small businesses (by gender, race/ethnicity, industry, urban vs. rural or regional location) that has policy relevance. The proposal shall provide detailed explanation of the databases, the limits as well as the merits, and explain how one or more data bases will be used to test the hypothesis. 

Anyone bidding on these proposals is expected to have a previous record of research on the topic of interest as well as familiarity with the databases.  Research with policy emphasis is encouraged. The proposal could start with a review of the literature, establish a set of hypotheses to be tested, describe the model and the data to test the model and then explain the results.

Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on July 10, 2006 and end on July 14, 2006. No questions after July 14, 2006. Questions MUST be email to the Contracting Specialist (sharonbrown@sba.gov). Fax or email proposals will not be accepted.
Please provide the RFQ number in your email subject line for questions.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The purpose of this revision is to provide answers to questions received thus far on the public announcement for the A-76 Study of its OITSS function.
 *	When will the target dates/milestones of this Competition Schedule be published?

The schedule should be released with a Request for Information (RFI) to be published in November.

 *	Based on the dates mentioned in the Special Notice and FDA web site, should we assume that the FDA will/has already requested from OMB to grant a6-month extension on this competition (the length of this A76 competition will be 18 months)

Yes, the FDA was granted a 6 month extension on this competition.

 *	Has the FDA MEO Team and PWS Team been established yet?
Yes

 *	Does the FDA MEO desire to team with industry, and if so, per the A76 Circular, will the FDA MEO only be able to team with those companies that already have in-scope, incumbent support contracts in place with the FDA?

The Government's Agency Tender Team will determine its strategy in terms of potential partnering. If the Agency Tender Team deems it necessary, a Sources Sought synopsis will be published in FedBizOpps seeking input from interested firms.  The purpose of FedBizOpps announcement dated 9/15/06 was to provide public notice of the Standard Competition, not to solicit potential partners.
   If the Agency Tender Team elects to consider new partners,  it will be bound by the provisions of OMB Circular A-76, Attachment B, paragraph C.4.a.(1)(a), which states: "Agencies shall not include new MEO subcontracts that would result in the direct conversion of work performed by government
employees."   


*	Are the FDA employees that are currently performing this work part of a Union/Union employees? One Union or multiple Unions? 

Yes, the unions are FDA/NTEU and AFGE.

 *	How many people/contractors make up the multiple, in-scope, support contracts mentioned?

This is being further developed and will be a part of the draft Performance Work Statement released with the RFI.

 *	Has a Preliminary Planning Report or any independent studies been completed for the in-scope OITSS services that make up this A76? Are these documents available to review?

A Functional Assessment is in process. The final report has not been completed.  We intend to issue a draft Performance Work Statement which will address the scope of work anticipated for this A-76 study.

<DESC>PLEASE NOTE THAT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THIS NOTICE:

The General Services Administration, Public Building Services (GSA/PBS), Tenant and Property Operations, Manhattan Acquisition Unit (2POA-M) on behalf of the Regional Historic Preservation Office, intends to procure the following Specialized Historic Preservation A-E Services:

The work described below concerns the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House at 1 Bowling Green, NYC.  The building is a historic landmark and will celebrate its centennial next year.  All design and construction work connected with this building must be coordinated with GSA's Regional Historic Preservation Officer (RHPO).

In August of 2006 marble pieces fell from vertical interior surfaces.  Steps were taken to either remove the marble or temporarily secure it in place to alleviate further dangerous situations.  A-E will be required to:
1. Do a survey of all the stone paneling throughout the building.  
2. Panels exhibiting less than safe adherence shall be discreetly marked for:
a)	Immediate repair/reattachment (i.e. within first 30 days of a construction contract)
b)	Longer term repair/reattachment (to be done after the immediate panels are corrected.)
3. In addition to the discreet marking of panels create a survey drawing identifying the panels in need of repair/reattachment.
4. Prepare a report describing the methods used to do the survey as well as the results.
5. Prepare specifications/drawings depicting the methods that a contractor must employ to repair/reattach the faulty panels.  The detail in the specs/drawings shall be clear enough to permit qualified contractors to bid on and carry out the needed repairs/reattachments.
6. Recommend at least three contractors that have performed similar restoration work.
7. Prepare estimates of the envisioned construction work.
8. It is noted that some panels have already been removed or broken.  It is desired, to the extent possible, to repair/reinstall these panels. Panels falling into this category shall be specifically highlighted in your report.   If panels are beyond saving then replacement panels closely resembling the original shall be fully detailed and specified.

Selected A-E must have past performance of historic preservation work.
No solicitation, request for proposal or request for quote is available for this procurement.  Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the GSA/PBS/RHPO requirements described herein may submit a response no later than Thursday October 5, 2006, to the POC listed below by 3:30 p.m. EST to be considered:

General Services Administration, Public Building Service, 
Tenant and Property Operations, Manhattan Acquisition Unit, 
26 Federal Plaza, Room 1655, New York, New York, 10278
Attention: James K. Smith.  

All interested parties are required to submit their qualifications to the Contracting Officer in the form of SF 330.  Submit to the above referenced address and include the routing symbol (2POA-M) to ensure proper delivery.  Please verify that all required information is submitted and accurate.  Firms should include all relevant information about past design projects similar in type to this project.  This is NOT a request for proposals.

Pertinent factors for consideration for qualification for this project, listed in order of importance are:

1. Selected A-E shall have proven historic preservation capability. 2. Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm with the type of services required. 3. Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and record of working together as a team. 4. Capacity of the firm to perform the work (including any specialized work) within the time limitations. 5. Past record of performance with historic preservation.

Respondents should be advised that work may be required to be performed after normal business hours so as not to disturb tenants of the building.  The selected A-E shall provide their own material (including but not limited to ladders, scaffolds, safety gear, etc.) as may be necessary to conduct the survey.  The winning bidder shall be required to apply for security clearances for those employees intending to enter and work in the building. Any parties that believe they can meet the requirements of this project must ensure that their submission includes the following information:

 	Brief resumes of the key personnel expected to be involved in the work detailing their qualifications related to historical preservation.
 	The method of doing the survey to determine the soundness and safety of the panels shall be briefly described and should include a description of "go, no-go" criteria.  In other words, what level of survey reading would indicate a poorly adhered panel (i.e. requiring remedial repair) and what level indicates a well adhered safe and sound panel. 

NOTICE TO ALL PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTORS:

1. The response date for this project is hereby reaffirmed as 3:30 pm Thursday October 5, 2006.

2. A walk through of the Alexander Hamilton US Customs House will be scheduled for all qualified firms after the receipt of the Standard Form 330 on the aforementioned response date.

<RESPDATE>042406
<CONTACT>Rebecca Clausen, Contract Specialist, Phone 919.541.3002, Fax null, Email clausen.rebecca@epa.gov
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to provide support for NATA and Risk Assessment Activities within the Integrated Air Program.  The EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  This component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA?s Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics initiative. The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales, ranging from national-scale to local-scale assessments.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach.   One of the purposes of this contract is to provide support for risk assessment activities associated with the first component of EPA's air toxics program.  Within the context of this component, EPA evaluates the effects of hazardous and potentially hazardous air pollutants and develops appropriate regulatory strategies. In this role, EPA:  (1) identifies, screens, and characterizes air pollutants to determine which should be evaluated further as candidates for being listed as hazardous;  (2) reviews and evaluates health and/or ecological assessment documents on hazardous air pollutants; (3) performs risk assessments using EPA methods and models, or other methods and/or models if more appropriate to help guide reasoned decision-making; (4) identifies and evaluates alternative control options; (5) gathers information on production, use, emissions, control technology, control cost, and regulatory status to establish appropriate regulatory development priorities; (6) assesses the effectiveness of EPA and State/local programs in controlling hazardous and criteria pollutants; and (7) coordinates with other EPA offices and Federal and State/local programs to develop appropriate single or multimedia (e.g.,  air, water, solid waste, and/or other media) regulations. 	Another purpose of this contract is to provide support for the second, third, and fourth components of EPA's air toxics program.  This will be accomplished by developing assessment tools, conducting assessments, communicating the results of assessments, and educating the public.  In addition, as EPA moves forward with its air program, the EPA will be examining the air pollution problem in a more integrated fashion (i.e., considering the cumulative effects of air toxics and criteria pollutants across media rather than conducting separate assessments).  This contract will also provide support for these integrated assessments.  EPA anticipates the award of two cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contract with a base period of performance of twelve (12) months, with four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.   The total duration of the proposed contracts is sixty (60) months.  The first contract, will be awarded on the basis of full and open competition which will consist of 5,100 base quantity labor hours and 15,300 optional quantity labor hours for each of the five (5) periods, for a total contract maximum of 102,000 labor hours.  The second contract, will be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside which will consist of 5,100 base quantity labor hours and 15,300 optional quantity labor hours for each of the five (5) periods, for a total contract maximum of 102,000 labor hours.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620  with a size standard of 6.5 million.  This requirement is a follow on to contract numbers 68-D-01-071 and 68-D-01-076 with ECR and 68-D-01-052 with ICF each of which expire on September 30, 2006.  The RFP will be issued approximately on March 6, 2006 and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date.  The solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.   If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments. The Government is not obligated or committed to award any contract as a result of this notice.

<CONTACT>Steve Paschke, Business Specialist, Phone 208-526-1113, Fax 208-526-0876, Email sdp@inel.gov
<DESC>INVENTION SUMMARY:

Biofouling, the microbial plugging of wells rendering them inoperable, is a common problem in groundwater wells worldwide.  Costly vadose zone vapor vacuum extraction and pump and treat processes are all subject to biofouling.  Elimination of biofouling, caused by iron bacteria and other microorganisms, will become more important as additional vadose zone remediation and monitoring wells are installed.  It is important to protect all wells from being rendered useless due to microbial fouling.   

BEA has developed a well design, along with application methods, to prevent microbial growth.  This design allows water soluble, time released, antimicrobial materials to be available immediately after well completion.  Access lines provide a means for adding time released antimicrobial pellets, or pumped liquids and gaseous antimicrobial agents, into the sand pack surrounding the production zone of the completed well.  These methods inhibit bacterial growth in the packing; provide an efficient means for reducing biofouling; help to avoid expensive damage to pumps, piping and fixtures; and potentially eliminate well replacements.   

This well design will help prevent microbial populations responsible for fouling wells from initially developing; prevent costly replacement wells; and allow remediation operations to continue during biofouling treatment. Antimicrobial placement technology can prevent problems before they start, saving time and money.

Contact Mr. Gary W. Smith.  A potential licensing opportunity exists with BEA, the prime operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).  BEA is soliciting a written indication of interest from industrial partners interested in entering into a license agreement for the purpose of commercializing the technology described below.  This is not an opportunity to provide goods or services to BEA or DOE.  This solicitation will close to response 30 days after publication.  Parties interested in obtaining additional information should send their request to the following address:

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) , seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying information from government, academia, and industry sources regarding novel solutions for the tanker protective system.  The immediate objective is to survey and assess the most advanced Self Sealing Coupons to prevent leakage from tanker assets after ballistic impact from 0.50 caliber AP projectile impacting at 100 ft/s above muzzle velocity, see attachment on our homepage at http://www.nswc.navy.mil/wwwDL/XD/Supply.  The intention of the self sealing concept is that a material may be applied externally to a steel vessel containing a liquid. After an impact due to a 0.50 Cal. AP bullet where the bullet makes a complete penetration, the self-sealing material will close the entrance hole and either prevent or greatly reduce liquid spillage. A dependence on performance vs. temperature will also be studied. This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind.  Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements.  Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public.  The Government is primarily focused on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements.  If no such commercial/non-developmental items currently exist, the Government may entertain the procurement of developmental items based on the information received as a result of this market research.   Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability.  At a minimum, this information should include:  1) identification of your company or organization, 2) your company’s or organization’s assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements, 3) business/contracts/marketing office point (s) of contact information, 4) notification of business size and/or special status and 5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) Magnetospheric Multi-Scale (MMS) Magnetometer Booms THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE. The NASA/GSFC Magnetospheric Multi-Scale (MMS) Project is considering the purchase of eight (8) Magnetometer Boom flight units plus two (2) sets of Mechanical Ground Support Equipment (MGSE) for use in deployment testing.   A draft specification for the boom is attached. The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential interest in providing the Magnetometer Booms for the Project. This is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement and to promote competition.  While our intent may be to team with industrial partner(s), we are not bound by this RFI to do so. This is not a Request for Proposal, nor a Request for Quotation, nor an Invitation to Bid.  Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI.  NASA would like to survey existing deployable booms available in the market in order to incorporate this information into the MMS Observatory conceptual design and to obtain answers to these questions: 1.  What booms does your company have existing or available with minimal change that would meet the draft specification? 2.  Are there any key drivers within the draft specification that are overly restrictive and/or missing that should be added, deleted, and/or changed?  NASA is flexible on many of the requirements identified in the specification and would appreciate your inputs regarding requirements in the draft specification that could be changed to simplify the requirements.  The driving requirements include:  a. Minimum 5m length – (goal: longer booms are highly desired). b. Maximum 12 inch diameter housing (for coilables).  (goal - smaller stowed envelop highly, will consider larger, however.). c. 8 kg weight per boom (goal - will consider heavier). 	d. 0.5 Hz deployed natural frequency (with analysis, will consider lower frequency). 3.  What is a rough estimate of the price for eight (8) flight units plus two (2) sets of MGSE for deployment testing? If NASA decides to compete this requirement, the competitive procurement process is expected to begin around June 2008 with a selection around October 2008.  The first two booms would be delivered in approximately October 2010.  Subsequent units would be delivered in pairs every four months thereafter. To consolidate our planning, responses from industry are requested in three weeks, in the form of written and illustrated concepts, estimates for development costs and schedule, assumptions used for cost and schedule estimates including interface and design assumptions, and descriptions of capabilities.	  Additionally, NASA would like for industry to evaluate if this requirement could be considered a Commercial requirement in order to use FAR Subpart 12.  Responses can be submitted via email. The subject line of the submission should be "RFI for MMS Magnetometer Booms,” and attachments should be in Microsoft WORD, POWERPOINT, or PDF format. The email text must give a point-of-contact and provide his/her name, address, telephone/fax numbers, and email address. The information is requested for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information for Planning Purposes." It is not NASA's intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this solicitation. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Technical questions should be directed to:  Pete Spidaliere at (301) 286-6222 or Peter.D.Spidaliere@nasa.gov.  Procurement related questions should be directed to: Julie Janus at (301) 286-4931 or Julie.A.Janus@nasa.gov.

<SUBJECT>38--Seeking advanced capabilities for infrastructure resortation for advanced surfacing capabilities.  The U.S. Army Engineers seek to reduce road restoration operations to reduce times for harden surfaces.
<SOLNBR>W56HZV-07-C-XXXX
<RESPDATE>100306
<ARCHDATE>12022006

<DESC>The United States Army (U.S. Army) requirements to support conflict torn infrastructures continue to surface.  Efforts to restore and rehabilitate these shattered infrastructures in support of local populaces are primarily coordinated and conducted b y U.S. Army Engineers.   3.  PROBLEM:  U.S. Army Engineers are relentlessly engaged in the construction, repair, and maintenance of roads, throughways, parking-areas, walkways, airfields, bridges, buildings etc.  Additionally, these Engineers are also responsible for the continual  infrastructure upkeep of U.S. and Joint Force Operating Bases.  Unfortunately, during restoration operations U.S. Army Engineers must rely on existing equipment capabilities and out dated technologies (i.e.) conventional methods of concrete, asphalt and p aving techniques conducted with massive amounts of large oversized equipment and materials operating in overpopulated and confined areas.  Additionally, conventional concrete, asphalt/paving methods expose Soldiers to enemy attack for prolong periods of ti me. 4.  SOLUTION:        a. To mitigate some of these requirements and to reduce restoration operations to manageable levels for U.S. Army Engineers the Army is seeking information on products, methods and equipment to rapidly harden surfaces.  Advances in surfacing technolog y have led to the introduction of many new products in the commercial construction industry for surface hardening, finishing, refinishing, maintenance and upkeep.  These products provide alternatives to conventional methods of surface treatment and in some  cases claim to perform similarly to asphalt and concrete with respect to strength, toughness and durability.        b. Additional benefits are alleged in the areas of reduced application efforts, material storage, material cost, transportation and equipment required for installation.  Some of these technologies include the use of fast curing/rapid activating polyme rs, carbon fibers and low dosage resins, woven and non-woven geotextiles and various fiber reinforced materials.  These materials must be investigated to determine their applicability to U.S. Army operations and to provide some lasting measure of effective ness to local populations after application.        c. The ability of these materials to be applied with existing U.S. Army asphalt and paving equipment and its adaptability to the challenges of a military environment are critical components to successfully rehabilitating an area. 5.  REQUIREMENTS:        a. Areas of key interest with these products are:  (1) fast activating/curing of material; (2) hardness, strength and durability of material; (3) ease of material application; (4) minimal/reduced equipment required during material application; (5) tra nsportation, storage and logistical requirements of material; (6) thickness, composition and application alternatives of materiel on various types of existing surfaces; and (7) application conditions and performance limitations in various environments/cond itions.       b. Durabilty and strength requirements can be divided into 2 categories.  Ideally one solution would meet both requirements. 		1) A two inch thick or less layer of material providing an equal or greater strength, durability and load bearing capacity as a six inch thick layer of concrete is required for road surfaces subjected to vehicular traffic.        		2) A material inherently capable of being applied to the sides and shoulders of roadways to a thickness level not exceeding two inches and of sufficient strength and durability as a three inch thick layer of concrete.       c. The material must not decrease its strength, durability, or load bearing capacity as its application is increased in length and width.        d. The material must be capable of being applied in all weather and environmental conditions throughout climatic conditions hot and basic (+120°  Fahrenheit (F) to -25° F) without reducing its streng th, durability, or load bearing capacity.       e. The material must be capable of being rapidly and directly applied to in-situ soils and onto existing road surfaces; asphalt, concrete, compacted dirt etc.  The material must be capable of being applied with minimal surface preparation required (i .e.) hasty leveling, debris/obstacle removal etc.)  The material must adhere to, bond with, conform to, and fill existing surface imperfections such as voids, high/low areas, ruts, cracks, depressions, deformations (etc.) without the loss of its strength, durability and load bearing characteristics.        f. The material must air dry to its maximum strength level immediately; 30 minutes or less Threshold (T); 10 minutes or less Objective (O), after application and require minimal and expedient (T); none (O), additional procedures to be effective (i.e.)  compaction, screeding, leveling etc.  The material must be compatible with those materials that it will cover or come in contact with (i.e.) asphalt, concrete, aggregates, and not become ineffective or cause existing surfaces to deteriorate due to its app lication and interaction.       g. The material must be capable of being applied through the use of:  (1) existing U.S. Army Engineer asphalt and paving equipment assets, e.g. the Engineer Mission Module-Bitumen Distributor (EMM-BD); (2) the material manufacturers dispensing equipm ent that is interoperable with and capable of being towed behind an M917series dump truck, Family Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) cargo/dump truck; adaptable-mountable/demountable to an existing U.S. Army equipment item platform such as an FMTV cargo/dump truck, Palletized Load System (PLS) flat rack, High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) etc.       h. The material must not become malleable or reduce its strength, durability, effectiveness, or load bearing characteristics after exposure (brief or continuous) to; (1) petroleum based products such as solvents, gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, fuel and  lubricating oils, diesel fuel, paint thinner etc; (2) other liquids such as bleach, acetone, boric acid, liquid soap, etc.      i. The material must support unlimited throughput of military vehicles, i.e. convoys as large as fifty vehicles at a time without incurring damage; deformation, rutting, cracking, swelling, separation, etc. 6.  LOGISTICAL REQUIRMENTS:  Impacts to the existing U.S. Army logistical system are required to be minimal.  The material must not create an additional logistical burden to an already overburdened logistical system by adding numerous additional materials/ items in order to be effective and supported.        a. The material must be transportable by standard U.S. Army transport assets (i.e.) FMTV, 900 series vehicles, PLS flat rack, and EMM-Dump Body, M917 series dump trucks, FMTV dump truck.  The material must be adequately sized and proportionately fit i nside of and be transportable in standard U.S. Army quad containers/International Standardization Organization (ISO) containers, or on  standard U.S. Army semi-trailers, e.g. M172 Series, M870 Series and M872 Series.        b. The material must be capable of being loaded/downloaded and prepared for dispensing into machinery dispensing reservoirs by existing U.S. Army Material Handling Equipment (MHE) 4,000-10,000 lb forklifts, 7.5 ton crane, All Terrain Crane (ATEC), an d 2.5 and 5.0 yard bucket loader forklift attachment.        c. The material must be conformable to a standard military 463L pallet and capable of being loaded and transported on C-130 aircraft.   7.

<SUBJECT>A -- Operations and Technical Support Services
<DESC>This is a special notice regarding the Operations and Technical Support (OTS) of the National Cancer Institute-Frederick (NCI-F), a Government-owned Contractor-operated research facility designated as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). The National Cancer Institute intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the incumbent, SAIC-Frederick, Inc., 10260 Campus Point Drive, San Diego, California 92121.  The anticipated OTS contract will consist of a base period of three (3) years, five (5) one-year award term options, and one (1) two-year option for a potential ten-year period of performance.

The statutory authority permitting this action is 41 USC 253(c)(3) and the FAR reference is 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) which authorizes an exception to full and open competition when it is necessary to award a contract to a particular source in order to maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by a FFRDC. The determination to negotiate on a sole source basis is a unilateral right of the Government.  This action is necessary to maintain the outstanding capability of NCI-F and perform the mission of the National Cancer Institute.  The Government has decided to exercise this right based on the need to provide the ongoing development of new technologies and the translation of basic science discoveries into novel agents for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer and AIDS.  The Government has determined that the OTS services being provided by the incumbent are at such an outstanding technical level, and at a cost that is fully reasonable and in accord with the technical performance, that meaningful improvement in performance cannot be achieved through solicitation and award to another source.  

Notwithstanding the determination referenced above, the Government has received an expression of interest from other contractors.   In response to this interest, the Government is allowing interested parties the opportunity to submit a capability statement (not to exceed 20 pages).  A draft statement of work and capability assessment information are attached.  Capability statements must be sufficiently detailed to allow for Government assessment based on the attached capability assessment information.  It must be readily apparent from the capability statement that an organization has the staff and corporate experience to provide meaningful improvement to the outstanding performance level of the incumbent contractor.  

This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement.  This is not a request for proposals.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses under this announcement nor otherwise pay for preparing any information sent for the Government's use.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  In addition, interested organizations presenting a capability statement must provide the following: 1) company name and address; 2) point of contact; and, 3) phone/fax/e-mail.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement will provide meaningful improvement in performance to the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Please submit the capability statement information by 4:00 PM EST on November 16, 2006 to NCI-Frederick, Bldg. 427, Rm. 10, Frederick, Maryland  21702, Attn: Mr. David Ramos.

<DESC>OPM has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.   The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.  ATF will provide these regulations to the Contractor.

ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators.  Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations.  Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.

Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.

Contractors? duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability.  Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Contractors will be paid at the rate of $53.00 per hour.   The hourly rate will be reviewed on an annual basis and may be adjusted as determined by the increase of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Internal reviews of Contractor performance are conducted on a quarterly basis.  

In compliance with ATF?s specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractor?s invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work. 

ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.  Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.  


Contractors must be willing to attend periodic conferences at selected locations within the United States.  Conferences are usually limited to one per year.  

Contractors will have access to ATFs computer network and will sign ATF P 7500.1, ATF Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users.  Contractors are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year.

Contractors shall submit to the performance of a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).  Favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF facilities and information.  ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.

Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  

Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. 

ATF intends to issue to multiple vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2010.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors. 

Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.

The following clauses are incorporated in full force:  FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror ? Commercial Items (Oct. 00)  and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference)  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items;  A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications- can be found on the web at www.arnet.gov/far. The Contractor may request a copy from siadministration@atf.gov.  Offeror shall provide a statement proving they have read and understand the term and Conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.


EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendors acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate).  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply.  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as passed will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of at least 54 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores.  At least 30 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Capabilities and 24 must come Vendor Qualifications.

a.  Experience/Capabilities (45 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each vendor?s experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the vendors communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. (30 points minimum).

b.  Qualifications/Past Performance (40 Points):  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the vendors customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendors performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases. (24 points minimum).

Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.

c.  Acceptability.  ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a pass or fail basis.  A vendors offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendors assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

If a copy of the Statement of Work is required in order to respond to this solicitation, please submit a written request via email to siadministration@atf.gov.  

***YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUTE DAILY TO THE 
PERSONNEL SECURITY BRANCH OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, DC***

The vendor must also complete a copy of the FAR 52.212-3, and provide a statement proving the vendor has read and fully understands all the terms and conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.  Resumes should highlight the vendors experience and capabilities in performing background investigations.  Please provide examples of your qualifications and how those duties relate to the vendors past and/or current performance. These examples will be used in evaluating the vendors Qualifications and Past Performance.

Only written requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable, i.e., each individual vendor (person) must submit their own proposal. (No phone calls will be accepted).

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  FAR 52.217-5  Evaluation of Options.  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award as follows: If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.    The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor?s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of Boat Joiner Workers/Lead Boat Joiner are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered.  The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Firms lacking a record of relevant past performance history, or for whom information on past performance is not available, shall receive a neutral evaluation.  Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate for the base year and each option year.  The labor category totals for the base year and each option year will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.  Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offerors understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.  This requirement will be awarded on an all or none basis.

Factor 4 - Construction Safety

The Government desires to do business with only those firms that excel in safety performance.  This factor exists to emphasize the importance of safety in and around all construction sites and at the base where construction work is being performed.   This factor consists of two subfactors that (1) will evaluate specific aspects of the offerors construction safety program and (2) will evaluate the offeror's safety performance history by contacting references, including but not limited to clients, insurance agencies and subcontractors.  For purposes of this evaluation, Subfactor A is less important than Subfactor B.    

	Subfactor A:  Safety Program.  The offeror shall provide information that demonstrates a corporate commitment to construction safety by addressing the following:

Processes/Standard Operating Procedures
Management Involvement/Commitment
Employee participation and training
Incentive/Awards program
Other safety program innovations

Offerors shall not submit their Corporate Safety Plan to satisfy the response to this subfactor.  

	Subfactor B:  Safety Performance History.  The offeror shall describe all lost time construction accidents/mishaps that occurred on contracts over the past two years.  This information is required for the prime contractor and all subcontractors working on the jobsite. Your response shall address each of the following:

	Description of Accident/Mishap and whether prime or subcontractor event 
Date/location of occurrence and contract title
Actions taken following accident/mishap
	Agency/client POC and phone number
	Employer (of employee affected by event) POC and phone number

The Government will contact references for the purpose of validating the information provided in response to this factor as well as obtaining further insight into each offeror's corporate safety philosophy.   The frequency and severity of events may have significant impact in the rating assigned to this factor.  The Government reserves the right to call any or all previous clients for the purpose of obtaining additional information regarding your record of accidents and mishaps.

Factor 5a - Subcontracting History

Factor 5a is included to obtain the offerors history of subcontracting to Small Business, Small Disadvantaged, Historically underutilized small zone small businesses, women owned small businesses, service disabled veteran owned small businesses, veteran owned small businesses, and historically black college and university/minority institutes.  

Factor 5a in Phase I and 5b found in Phase II are subfactors equal in importance to each other.  Factor 5b will be evaluated under Phase II and an overall rating for this factor will be assigned.  

Offerors must address the following in sufficient detail to allow proper evaluation and rating: 

1.	Provide SF-294 forms, "Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts?, for projects identified under technical factor 2, Relevant Experience (construction team).  If the referenced projects were not DOD procurements and an SF-294 was not required, provide any other documentation showing compliance with the utilization of Small Business firms in each noted category (e.g., Small, Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone Small, Veteran Owned Small, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small and Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions, if applicable).  Include the dollar value and percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to these entities.  If goals were not met on the referenced contracts, provide an explanation as to why.

2.	Provide information on any awards you've received within the past three (3) years for outstanding support to the small business community.

Provide information, if available, on use of Community Rehabilitation Programs organizations certified under the Javits-Wagner O'Day Program (JWOD) by NISH or NIB.


PAST PERFORMANCE
Past Performance information is one indicator of an offeror's ability to perform this contract successfully.  This evaluation will include the performance history of both the construction entity and the design entity.  The relevancy and source of the information, context of data, and general trends in a contractor's performance shall be taken into consideration.  The assessment of the offeror's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and establishes a level of confidence or risk for successful performance under this contract.  Past Performance findings will influence the relative standing of the offeror.  Findings will be used to validate proposals against established criteria.

By contacting references provided under Factors 1 and 2, the Government will evaluate the offerors past performance.  Offerors are authorized to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective actions taken.  In investigating the contractor's past performance, the Government is not limited to the references submitted but may rely on other sources as well.

Evaluation of Past Performance will be a subjective assessment.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services as well as fair and reasonable pricing.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's record of conforming to specifications and standards of good workmanship, and will evaluate the offeror's record on cost control/change orders and adherence to contract schedules.  Subcontractor management, safety management, and other quality control programs will also be reviewed.  The Government will examine the offeror's record for reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to customer satisfaction, and in general, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. 

Offerors may be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the offeror's response will be taken into consideration.  A review of CCAS and ACAS may be performed.

PHASE II. EVALUATION FACTORS.  Please do not respond to Phase II factors at this time.  The following factors may be included Phase II.  The full text will be provided in the solicitation.  In Phase II: (1) the total of all Phase I and II technical/management factors; (2) Past Performance; and (3) Price, are considered equal in importance.

FACTOR 5b - Subcontracting Plan

FACTOR 6 - Design Solutions

PRICE  - Price will be evaluated during Phase II in terms of reasonableness based on a comparison of the Government Estimate and other offers received.

<CONTACT>Colleen Athas Purchasing Agent 3073442077     colleen_athas@nps.gov;
<DESC>The following information relays questions and answers concerning this solicitation to all interested bidders. This announcement constitutes as an amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation # Q1574060198. The response date remains unchanged. Question: Our discussion on Tuesday indicated that the dates for the move are from October 23, 2006 with a completion date of November 6, 2006.  I do not see any restrictions for working over the weekends.  Is this correct?  Can we assume that we are to work with the Contact for the Division that is being moved and that a Division representative will be available over the weekend for whichever Division might be affected for moving over a weekend?  Answer: Overtime, and work on Sundays and Federal Holidays is not authorized. Saturday work will only be allowed if the division representative is willing to work. Question: Are there any basic lodging facilities that we can arrange to rent for our crew on or near the campus?  Answer: Just what is available in Gardiner. Question: Could you tell me how many personnel were on the job from the previously contracted moving company when everything was moved out of the headquarters building?  It was also mentioned that a number of park personnel were utilized in moving the large safe to the Admin-Finance temporary facility.  I seem to recall that someone said there were a total of 20 men involved and that was not an exaggeration.  Could you confirm that for me and would we be able to arrange for park personnel again to aid in removing the safe?   Answer: I think this could be arranged. Question: I recall seeing an older aerial photo of the campus.  Do you have a map of the campus that we could use for managing our strategy?   Answer: I'll have to look for this.  I could get one Wednesday. Question: What are the restrictions (if any) about driving straight trucks on the grass for facilitating direct loading particularly where we would be dealing with fire safe file cabinets or the houses being used for offices?   Answer: As long as you don't damage the grass it should be ok.  Recommend putting down plywood. Question: When I first arrived for the meeting on Tuesday, I was visiting with J. Cunningham (?) about the move out of the headquarters.  She indicated that she was asked to facilitate moving some items with a forklift you have there.  Can we assume that we have the same access?  Answer: The Supply Center forklift will not be available for use by the moving contractor. Question: You mentioned that the railing from one end of each deck on the headquarters building was removed and a scissor lift was used to facilitate moving items to the upper floors.  You recommended that we use the same strategy.  Are we to assume that your maintenance personnel will remove the railing and place caution tape, cones or flags at the affected areas?   Answer: Your crews can remove the railing.  It simply lifts out.  Since your crews will be there, they should be responsible for placing caution tape, cones or additional safety measures as required.

*******Questions and Answers************

1.) What is the subject matter of the Guide?
The guide is a biannual product given to base newcomers (military members, civilian employees, and families) to help orient them to the base, its units and missions, and the local area.  It includes a base phone book.  Distribution is strictly prohibited beyond the specified delivery addresses, and both advertiser and 'sales material' copies must have the phone book removed. 

2.) "The contractor can sell advertisements for inclusion in the base telephone directory." Can you explain? Do you want a true marketing campaign?
The phone book portion may be expanded to include ads.  In the past, ads were limited to a particular section of the Guide.  However, only individual tear sheets may be sent to advertisers for proof of publication, and not the entire phone book.  

3.) Is the phone directory 4/color?
There is no requirement that the phone book be four-color.  Please be specific about what you intend to offer, and provide examples if possible.
