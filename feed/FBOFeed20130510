By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

<DESC>Pursuant to 13.106-1(b), the Federal Highway Administration intends to negotiate a brand name sole source purchase order with TrenchSafety for the purchase of Topcon Hiper V Base/Rover system with MM laser receiver to include the following:
<p>Dual kit Hiper V Base and rover with OAF Bundle, Config kit Dual Hiper V</p>
<p>Tesla Data collector</p>
<p>Fixed height Tripod</p>
<p>Range pole with Bipod</p>
<p>Onsite training</p>
<p>8090mmGPS 3D Rover Kit</p>
<p>This equipment will utilize 3D engineered models for the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD) and trial use by their field construction personnel. Topcon Hiper V Base/Rover system with MM laser receiver has been selected for this trial effort. The purpose of this trial is to meet the goals of the EDC11 3D Engineered Models because this system uses GPS base and rover technology commonly used by contractors but has additional versatility for applications requiring accuracy greater than GPS RTK technology alone. This GPS base/rover system can be upgraded with the simple addition of a laser transmitter to provided increased accuracy necessary for verification of paving layers, structures elevations, and fine-grading. The system can also share a contractor's (Topcon) laser transmitter for accuracy improvement when used with string-less paving. TrenchSafety is the only source that can complete the project since they have the software and firmware that controls the applications that are specific to the customers use.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A purchase order, issued under FAR Part 13 is anticipated and the total estimated value is not to exceed $35,435.00. <br /><br />The intent of this notice is not to request competitive proposals, and any information&nbsp;received from interested parties will only be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement should be conducted. However, interested parties may submit a description of their firm's capabilities for satisfying this requirement, which demonstrates they possess the ability to successfully perform this effort. The responses must be received by COB May 25, 2013. All questions concerning this matter should be addressed directly to Ms. Lynn Huffstutler at <a href="mailto:lynn.huffstutler@dot.go">lynn.huffstutler@dot.go</a>.</p>

<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Specs Surface Nano Analysis, Inc. for the purchase of a Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) Control System under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106 (b)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The requirement is based on NIST's need for a Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) Control System. The SPM systems are part of the CNST NanoLab and a resource accessible to researchers in the CNST and to outside users via collaboration to measure a wide range of physical properties of materials. Measuring the properties of new nanostructured materials is a critical part of the CNST mission. A versatile, sensitive, and easy to use SPM control system is required to characterize such new materials using NIST fabricated SPM instruments.</p>
<p>Sole source determination is based on the following NIST minimum requirements:<br />1) Can be programed in the instrument standard control environment of LabVIEW and operated by the LabVIEW realtime operating system. <br />2) The SPM control system shall have a high voltage amplifier stage with at least four differential inputs on BNC connectors with at least six output channels with an output voltage of at least +-400 V.<br />3) The SPM control system shall have a piezo motor driver unit to drive stick-slip types of coarse motion piezo motors at cryogenic temperatures down to 4K. The piezo motor driver shall have at least 8 channels which can be run individually or in parallel. The piezo motor driver shall have a sharp voltage transition going from +400 V to -400 in less than or equal to 1 &micro;s. <br />4) The SPM control system shall include a software control system that runs on a standard Windows-based PC running windows 7/8. The user interface shall have a digital Z-feedback controller with user defined control signals, the ability to start and stop the feedback loop, the ability to average the z-position during a defined time before switching the controller off, and the ability to apply an offset to the z-position from the value when the loop is opened. The Z controller shall allow any inputs or internal signals to be used as a feedback signal. The Z controller shall have basic mathematical operation capability as well as the ability to combine inputs signals for the feedback signal.<br />5) The SPM control system shall have an atom tracking feature with software interface to locate and track surface topography maxima or minima. <br />Specs Surface Nano Analysis, Inc. is the only vendor that offers a Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) Control System that is commercially available, the Nanonis BP4.5 meets all of NIST's requirements. No other vendor can provide a system that meets NIST's requirements.</p>

<p>Description:</p>
<p>The Rudloff Laboratory in the Surgery Branch, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis services comprising of the performance and analysis of a reverse-phase protein microarray.</p>
<p>The products herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1).</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the small business standard is $14 million.</p>
<p>Only one (1) award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Rudloff laboratory in the Surgery Branch at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) devotes its research efforts to the discovery of novel treatment strategies against pancreatic cancer. This disease remains one of the cancers with the highest mortality rates and there is an urgent need for improved therapies. Emphasis has been placed on the application of known small molecule inhibitors targeting major signaling pathways that are responsible for tumor development and growth in an extensive panel of over 50 pancreatic cancer cell lines and several patient tumor xenografts as well as the discovery of new small molecule inhibitors of pancreatic cancer in collaboration with the Chemical Development Group at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). Combined efforts have lead to the discovery of small molecule inhibitors that are highly potent against subsets of pancreas cancer. The majority, however, rapidly develop resistance to the drugs; a mechanism also seen in the clinic. To identify intracellular signaling pathways which mediate this resistance, changes in the activation of major intracellular pathways following treatment need to be studied. This information is vital to develop combination strategies that will allow the growth control of previously treatment-resistant pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>Applying the reversed-phase protein microarray will enable the NCI to determine resistance mechanisms in pancreas cancer and allow the NCI to fulfill its mission in developing novel treatments for this disease. The reverse-phase protein microarray is unique in that it enables the detection of changes in the phosphorylation status of proteins and therefore the activity of signaling pathways upon drug treatment in a high-throughput manner. This is a distinct advantage over, e.g. gene expression microarrays that allow the evaluation of mRNA levels (not [active] protein) or low-throughput methods such as western blotting.</p>
<p>The contractor shall (a) print each of 250 sample on the protein array in quadruplicate for the generation of technical replicates, positive controls, in situ protein normalization, and calibration curves, (b) scan arrays, extract and process data (primary analysis), and (c) provide data in XLS files (raw), customer report and quality control (QC) report as well as other relevant data analysis files.</p>
<p>Theranostics Health is unique as it is the only known US-based company that offers reverse-phase protein microarray services required for this project. Theranostics' platform is technically equivalent to other commercial reverse-phase protein microarray profiling companies. Theranostics Health has the capability of testing large batch sizes and protein concentrations of .5mg/ml allows for better economy of the NCI's limited sample resources.</p>
<p>The NCI knows of no other contractor that possesses the experience, expertise, and detailed knowledge of these studies needed to allow them to immediately undertake the tasks covered by this procurement and conduct these efforts in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party, particularly small businesses, believe they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office on or before 11:00 AM EST on May 24, 2013. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax); an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI contracting office to the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240)-276-5401 or emailed to Anh-Huy Nguyen, Contract Specialist at Anh-Huy.Nguyen@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-130067-HN on all correspondences.</p>

Individual orders will not be synopsized unless it is determined by the Contracting Officer that the requirements of FAR Part 5 have not been met by this notice for a specific order, or otherwise determines that the synopsis of the requirement is in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure this equipment under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Section 6.302-1. Moog Inc. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the AN/TRN-47 and ARN/URN-32 TACAN systems. These TACAN systems were developed to meet the Government specifications that only defined Form, Fit, and /function requirements at the system level. The Government does not own the technical data that is necessary to compete these requirements. Only Moog, Inc. possesses the proprietary technical data package (TDP) that is essential for manufacturing and depot-level repair of the TACAN systems. Without this TDP, it is not possible for any other source to perform repair analyses and complete the repairs and/or upgrades necessary to meet the needs of this requirement. Additionally, Moog, Inc. is the only source with the existing facilities, including a test bed, and the technical expertise required to assemble and test the systems and components.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;THIS IS A FORMAL SYNOPSIS OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION NOTICE IN<br />ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.2. THIS COMPETITIVE ACTION IS BEING PROCURED<br />UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the acquisition of ancillary materials (needles, syringes, and combination units, isopropyl alcohol prep pads) from medical/surgical device manufacturers to meet the vaccine administration needs of the American public during a pandemic influenza event. To ensure coverage, manufacturers are expected to acquire, maintain and rotate inventories of integrated needle and syringe units of various types for pandemic preparedness. The management of these materials will be coordinated and integrated by HHS/ASPR/BARDA to provide long-term solutions that address and satisfy the vaccine administration requirements during pandemic influenza events and account for recent technology advances in vaccine manufacturing where the ability to produce influenza vaccines may outstrip the capability of medical/surgical manufacturers to maintain pace with sufficient needle/syringe units.</p>
<p>The requirements for this RFP are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Manufacture and make available for purchase up to 512 million FDA approved integrated needle and syringe combination units.<br />2. Manufacture and make available for purchase up to 50 million FDA approved <br />Needle/Syringe combination unit, 5ml or 6ml syringe, 20Gx1.5" needle, safety engineered. <br />3.

Manufacture and make available for purchase up to 300 million FDA approved integrated needle and syringe combination units (conventional) <br />7. Provide a manufacturing/production schedule representative of the surge capacity that can be made available to the USG for pandemic planning purposes. <br />8. Upon request, provide a delivery schedule of the products that will be made available to the USG for pandemic Influenza response. <br />9. Store, rotate, replenish and manage USG purchased products as vendor management inventory.<br />10. Package, handle, and ship USG purchased products from contractor owned/contractor operated distribution facilities to USG designated domestic receiving locations. Receiving locations and Points of Contact information will be provided in task orders. For planning purposes, the USG may elect to identify up to ten (10) receiving locations in the following continental geographic regions; three (3) in the Northeast, two (2) in the South Central Midwest, two (2) in the North Central Midwest, and three (3) in the west region. The contractor shall include all costs and expenses for transit, delivery and insurance of USG product. <br />11. Exchange USG purchased products for similar products where market demands indicate a change in user preference for other drug device products. <br />12. Dispose of expired, adulterated or damaged USG products as directed by the USG. The contractor shall dispose of product following any federal, state, local regulation for the appropriate waste category and provide documentation on the completed disposal activity. <br />13.

<DESC>Description
<p>1. This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) survey. No solicitation exists at this time. The government will not reimburse participants for any information or expenses associated with their participation in this survey; nor does participation in this survey ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.</p>
<p>2. The Air Force Life-Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio is conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to manufacture and deliver C-27J aircraft. Responses to this survey will be used to influence the program's acquisition strategy. Responses should include sufficient detail to enable the government to adequately assess your interest and capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.).</p>
<p>3. The Mobility Directorate (AFLCMC/WL) is contemplating procurement of C-27J aircraft, in accordance with Congressional language that states "The secretary of the Air Force shall obligate and expend funds previously appropriated for the procurement of C-27J Spartan aircraft for the purposes for which such funds were originally appropriated." A complete re-procurement data package is not available. The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement action is 336411. Please indicate the number of employees relative to the size standard of 1,000 for this category and a determination of small business status. Responses shall include their assigned DUNS number and their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code. Firms must: (1) possess or demonstrate the ability to provide program management, manufacturing capabilities, engineering, financial, contracting, and quality assurance personnel required to fulfill C-27J aircraft requirements; (2) possess or demonstrate the ability to provide the material, engineering, factory and flight test equipment, and physical facilities required to fulfill C-27J aircraft requirements; (3) be a responsible contractor with demonstrated aircraft systems responsibility; (4) be capable of delivering C-27J aircraft starting in CY16; and (5) include in their response to this synopsis evidence of these capabilities. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, and or a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned.</p>
<p>4. Responses to this Synopsis are requested not later than 31 May 2013. Do not submit classified data. It is desirable, but not required, that responses be submitted on CD-ROM in an electronic format compatible with Microsoft Windows/Office with no macros. If the CD contains proprietary/competition sensitive material, the CD and the cover label should be marked &#8223;Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Material". Paper copies must be clearly labeled <br />&#8223;Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Material". Proprietary/competition sensitive material will be protected from disclosure. Responses should be sent to:</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM-CAS), is conducting a market survey to identify qualified sources for 155mm M982E1 Excalibur Ib Projectile Engineering Support.  This effort will result in a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) task order contract for FY13-FY15 requirements.  The purpose of this effort is to address various Excalibur Ib Engineering Support requirements to include but not limited to; cost reduction initiatives, producibility efforts, reliability improvement efforts, material obsolescence, software support, component refurbishment within the Excalibur system, and potential development/qualification efforts related to international interoperability.  These requirements at this time are planned to be restricted to Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ who is the current producer of the Excalibur Increment Ib Projectiles.  <br>  <br> The Excalibur Program is for a Precision-Guided, Extended-Range family of 155mm  <br> projectiles to deliver precise, lethal, cost effective and  to fire at ranges of up to 35 km and greater.  The 155mm Excalibur projectile enables the maneuver commander to precisely defeat critical targets while minimizing collateral damage and unexploded ordnance.

<DESC>A.  Background <br>  <br> The U.S. Military has a continual need to reduce the amount and overall weight of packaging waste generated in the field.  Millions of operational rations are consumed each year, generating thousands of tons of packaging waste.  Due to the enormous handling and disposal costs, the military needs ration packaging and packing materials such as stretch wrap for unit loads that reduce logistical burden, reduce dependence on petroleum-based plastics packaging, and eliminate negative impact on the environment. <br> Combat ration packaging systems, which include stretch wrap used for pallet loads of Meals, Ready-to Eat  (MRE ), must meet high performance and operational requirements in order to safely transport and preserve high-quality food items for the Warfighter.  These performance requirements include surviving rough handling, extreme weather conditions, and a three-year shelf life at 80 F.  Although current ration packaging materials and systems provide adequate protection for ration survival and shelf life, there are potentially more efficient, environmentally-friendly, lightweight, lower density, and cost effective alternative technologies available that could reduce the amount of packaging or raw material used, reduce transportation and disposal costs, and ultimately reduce military solid waste. <br>  <br> A current U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) project is investigating sustainable technologies and environmentally-friendly alternatives for secondary and unit load ration packaging systems, which include pallet stretch wraps and/or tunnel bags with decreased volume or density or that contain biodegradable and/or bio-based polymers.  As part of this project, a novel expandable polymeric microsphere technology as a stretch film component is being investigated by NSRDEC for potential pallet wrap applications.  Advantages of this novel technology may include reduced fossil-fuel based plastics use, solid waste, film density, and weight.  This concept is to introduce free volume into the stretch film thereby displacing polymer.  Expandable polymeric microspheres consist of isopentane gas encapsulated in a polyacrylonitrile polymer shell.  The thin plastic shell softens when heated and isopentane gas expansion causes the microsphere to expand.  Expansion results in the decrease in density from 1000 to 3 kg/m .  Expanded microspheres can deform or compress, and elastically can recover without rupture. <br>  <br> Previous studies at NSRDEC investigated cast and blown film extrusion of polyolefins such as high density polyethylene, polypropylene, and low density/linear low density polyethylene (LDPE/LLDPE) blends with microsphere loading levels ranging from 0.5 percent to 5 percent in monolayer and multilayer extruded films for other ration components in the MRE .  NSRDEC also conducted processing trials and testing of microspheres-loaded stretch film prototypes, which contained two grades of microspheres at two different loading levels in the stretch film.  The trials were conducted on a commercial blown stretch film production line, where four different multilayer stretch film prototypes containing expandable microspheres were produced as well as control stretch films that did not contain microspheres.  The microspheres were added to the core layer only in order to minimize expansion through the surface of the film.  Examination of the processed films by optical microscopy showed that the microspheres were intact and had expanded 3-5 times in diameter. <br>  <br> B.  Requirements <br>  <br> This proposed effort is focused on stretch wrap prototypes containing polymeric expandable microspheres, with the goal to reduce the amount and volume of plastic in the film.  This effort will support the US Army, as well as the US Navy Waste Afloat Protects the Sea (WRAPS) program involving research efforts by the NSRDEC to decrease the amount of plastic waste on board naval vessels. <br>  <br> The NSRDEC is looking to run multi-layer, blown stretch film using a common formula that is typically applied to the contractor's products, and then incorporate expandable microspheres into the film to determine how the microspheres affect the stretch properties of the film and what level of density/weight reduction we are observing in the final product.  As noted in the above section, NSRDEC conducted a similar initial trial in 2012.  The objective of this second trial is to modify and improve the cling layer of the stretch film containing the microspheres.   <br>  <br> The NSRDEC is seeking interested vendors to:  (a) complete small-scale, experimental blown film processing trials to incorporate two grades of expandable microspheres technology into standard LLDPE-based stretch film that are used for wrapping 40 quote mark  L x 48 quote mark  W pallet loads of US military combat rations, and, (b) conduct subsequent testing typical for stretch film of the control (unfilled) base stretch film and of each of four different microspheres-loaded stretch film prototypes (reference Table 2 below).  This effort will build upon the previous experience outlined above that NSRDEC has in working with microspheres in flexible polymeric films and stretch films.  NSRDEC's goal is that all prototypes possess good cling/tack, strength, and puncture properties in order to be able to survive any rough handling experienced during transportation and storage of ration pallet loads in the military supply chain. <br>  <br> 1.  Period of Performance <br> This overall effort should be completed within three months, including testing.  The film processing trial should be conducted within one month of contract award, followed by a series of testing of the four different microsphere-loaded prototypes and control stretch film. <br>  <br> 2.  Processing <br> The stretch film incorporating microspheres must be processed at low enough temperatures so that the microspheres do not burst or degrade.  Control of expansion is needed to ensure that all the microspheres are contained within the stretch film.  The two different types of microsphere masterbatches to be used in this trial are shown in Table 1, which is provided as attachment 1 to this sources sought synopses.  The melt temperature of all materials containing microspheres should not exceed the maximum melt temperatures specified in Table 1, which is provided as attachment 1 to this sources sought synopses.  Temperatures exceeding these values will cause the microspheres to turn yellow and degrade. <br>  <br> Manufacturing of this material must be producible with the use of the migratory cling agent polyisobutene (PiB) in an amount that will facilitate appropriate cling in the final microsphere-based stretch film prototypes.  Cling properties must be tested three days after film processing to allow enough time for the PiB to migrate to the surface of the film. <br>  <br> The five different samples to be produced during the trial are shown in Table 2, which is provided as attachment 1 to this sources sought synopses.  Two different microsphere loading levels will be trialed as specified by NSRDEC, for example, 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent by weight. <br>  <br> 3.  Deliverables <br>  <br> NSRDEC will be the owner of all finished products from this production trial.  Deliverables for this effort will include two rolls of stretch film for each of the five sample types shown in Table 2, which is provided as attachment 1 to this sources sought synopses, including the control film with no microspheres.  Each roll must be at least 1000 feet in length per sample type.  A total of 10 rolls of stretch film will be produced from the trial.  One roll of each sample type will be shipped to NSRDEC (5 rolls total).  One roll of each sample type will stay with the contractor for testing (5 rolls total), with any extra film being shipped to NSRDEC following completion of the contractor's testing. <br>  <br> The stretch film must be commercially supplied to NSRDEC in specified roll sizes and film thicknesses as listed in Table 3, which is provided as attachment 1 to this sources sought synopses. <br>  <br> In addition, all stretch film produced during the trial must be able to be applied to pallet loads manually or using automatic commercial stretch wrap equipment, and the control (unfilled) base stretch film must have good clarity and transparency. <br>  <br> 4.  Testing of Prototypes <br> The proposed contractor will also be responsible for conducting standard ASTM laboratory tests typical for stretch film on the four different prototypes and the control film (for reference), to include:  tensile (ultimate PSI and elongation percentage per ASTM D882), 50 percent and 100 percent modulus (PSI, per ASTM D882), Elmendorf tear (GM, D1922), cling - unstretched and stretched (GM, ASTM D4649), puncture resistance/impact (dart drop F50 per ASTM D1709), optics-  percent haze (ASTM D1003), gloss- 45 degree (percent), and C.O.F.

Subsequent programs that allow the production of product mailing labels and marketing mailings have been appended to the database.</p>
<p>Duplication Services (BE/DS) - BE/DS has been using an off-the shelf business automation application for about eight years. BE/DS uses this system to support sales order entry and tracking, customer billing, and accounting operations. <br /><br />Retail Services (BE/Retail) - BE/Retail also shares the same application as Duplication Services to support Point-of-Sale (POS) inventory management, accounting operations, and product replenishment.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">In 2009, the GSA and the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) program, implemented a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with UPS for Express and Ground domestic delivery service ("DDS2").<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This award enabled the Federal government to realize significant cost savings and provided robust management information reports to enable agencies to better manage shipments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current BPA will expire on September 30, 2014, and as such GSA and the FSSI program are currently engaged in the process of developing requirements for a third generation contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before detailed requirements are created and a Statement of Work / RFQ are given to vendors, GSA is engaging with the vendor community to understand market capabilities and emerging Government and commercial best practices for shipping management. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">In fiscal year 2012, the government shipped approximately 15,300,000 packages through the current DDS2 contract for a total of approximately $118M in spend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of these, approximately 55% were shipped via ground service, 33% of the packages were sent using an overnight service, and 10% were sent using a 2 Day service. The rest were sent a variety of other services</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">In addition, there was an identified 19,500,000 domestic packages going outside the current DDS2 contract for an approximate total of $235M</span></p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to determine current availability of existing surplus spacecraft buses or similar space flight hardware to use in studying ways of lowering the cost of flying MIDEX or Explorer (type) size missions.  Interested parties including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) are asked to provide capability statements. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. NASA is seeking specific information on the holdings of individual contractors, and feedback on the specific technical objectives defined herein. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), the information requested is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NASA will take procurement action in this matter. Furthermore, neither NASA, nor the Government will be responsible for any costs incurred in furnishing this information. BACKGROUND NASA is performing market research for a potential procurement of immediately available, inexpensive flight-qualified spacecraft buses (including GSE hardware, and with or without payload hardware) that can be used in a study to lower the cost of space flight missions.  The hardware configuration must be able to be flown as is or to be harvested for components to support scientific payloads.	In order to enable the economies of scale for missions which otherwise would not be affordable, we seek at least five existing spacecraft buses and spares that are designed to the same specification and that are available for a total cost of approximately $2,500,000 to $7,000,000.	The immediate need and low cost force serious consideration of previously manufactured hardware that has been properly stored, including climate control and appropriate purges. Documentation must be available describing the current status as well as the manufacturing, quality, and reliability of the hardware. SCHEDULE The first delivery of a spacecraft bus is required 1 month after contract award.  The second bus delivery is needed no later than 2 months after contract award.  The remaining deliveries should be delivered no later than 4 months after contract award. OTHER TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS Spacecraft buses must have been developed for LEO, MEO, and/or GEO operational orbit and have proven flight-heritage.  The flight hardware must have completed environmental testing at the component and system level and have associated anomaly documentation available for the hardware. At least 5 spacecraft from the same production line must be provided to allow NASA to standardize interfaces.  This would allow NASA to keep launch vehicle and payload interfaces constant. Minimum Spacecraft Bus Design Performance: Designed to support greater than or equal to 6000 Watt load for 10-year orbit life Solar arrays with redundant motors and gear drives Attitude control features for 3-axis stabilized spacecraft system and with supporting propulsion system Radiation Hardness of electronic parts no less than 100 krad Commercial design standards are acceptable Payload mass capability of 1000 kg or better If previously stored, the buses and associated hardware must have been stored in environmentally controlled storage since integration. INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to provide this hardware as outlined above are invited to submit their electronic response to this Sources Sought Notice no later than May 22, 2013, 5pm EDT.

<CONTACT>Michael T Lininger, Email michael.lininger@nist.gov
<DESC>Ansys Inc. Q3D License renewal and Technical Support
<p>PURPOSE<br />Technical support is required in order to renew our license for Q3D Extractor, which is a finite-element electromagnetic simulation package. We use this simulation package in order to analyze our measurement structures so that we can obtain material parameters directly from our measurements. We have several programs that rely on analysis using Q3D extractor as an integral step in the data analysis procedures, and we therefore require an extension of the software license beyond July 1, 2013.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: <br />This software performs two-dimensional finite-element electromagnetic simulations, which we use to calculate the detailed EM field distributions within our planar devices. We have tested several different EM simulation packages over the past 5 years, including Agilent Momentum, Sonnet, and Ansoft HFSS, and have determined that the product that we currently use, Ansoft Q3D, is the only one to provide results that can be successfully incorporated into our analysis procedures to yield the EM material properties of our materials under test. The license renewal for this EM simulation package is therefore necessary for our technical programs, much less expensive than investing in an entirely new EM simulation tool, and has been determined to be the only available EM simulation tool to do what we need it to do.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) the classification/ type of small business (e.g., whether they are small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, HubZone small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small business, economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB) or women-owned small business (WOSB)) and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. Teaming and partnering arrangements among small businesses is encouraged.</p>
<p>A. Background</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Neurobiobank, comprised of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS), will be supporting an as yet unspecified number of Brain and Tissue Repositories in the near future. These Brain and Tissue Repositories (BTRs) will be federated through an IT Portal to increase coordination and sharing of valuable resources. Centralized toxicology testing of brain and other tissues from these repositories is one way to save money and increase standardization amongst the BTRs. Economies of scale and increased efficiency could be achieved by having all brains acquired through BTRs screened under a single tissue analysis contract.</p>
<p>The NIH Neurobiobank is seeking a tissue testing service that can provide validated, high quality toxicology and infectious disease testing services for these NIH supported BTRs.</p>
<p>B. Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide services that can assay up to 750 samples/yr. These assays will include screens for multiple drug classes/types, multiple infectious diseases and environmental exposures. The majority of agents to be tested under this program will be drugs of abuse or psychotropic drugs. The Contractor may be required to do a combination of assays on a given tissue, or assess a particular drug in several tissue types (e.g. blood, brain, and hair) according to the needs of investigators requesting services and NIH Neurobiobank programmatic priorities.</p>
<p>C. Project Requirements</p>
<p>Qualified sources will be required to assay specimens, document and prepare reports of results. The reports must be electronically submitted to a third party interactive web site (508c compliant) herein referred to as the NIH Neurobiobank Portal.</p>
<p>The anticipated contracts will include Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and protocols and Quality Assurance/Quality Control requirements for prospective evaluation of short and long term specimen integrity, viability and function.</p>
<p>Qualified sources must have:</p>
<p>1. An infrastructure to actively receive, assay and report results from up to 750 brain, blood, and/or hair samples/year. Toxicology testing facility must operate in accordance with all applicable state and local laws and Federal regulations.</p>
<p>2. The ability to report results to the NIH Neurobiobank Portal, a third party interactive web site (508c compliant), as the data are generated.</p>
<p>3. Sufficient capacity to process and assay 500-750 biologic specimens. This includes sufficient ultra-freezers; and additional storage and processing capacity should be available for non-frozen material including fixed tissues. Provide a climate-controlled facility with the capacity to maintain room temperatures such that freezers can function normally when all equipment is operating, with sufficient back up power to maintain normal operation in a power failure. Provide enough back-up freezer space to accommodate the failure of at least one freezer. Complete transfer of the contents of a freezer shall occur within two (2) hours of an initial freezer failure. Provide adequate, on-site back-up power to handle complete electrical power failure.</p>
<p>4. Information Technology (IT) Security that is compliant with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) to ensure security of all data generated over the life of the contract.</p>
<p>5. Appropriate shipping licenses and permits from local, State, Federal and International authorities for the safe import, storage and distribution of biological specimens, according to current regulatory guidelines, as applicable by time of award.</p>
<p>7. Procedures and protocols for safe handling of potentially hazardous and infectious materials.</p>
<p>D. Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>June 30, 2014 - June 29, 2015 (with yearly options to extend term of the contract through June 29, 2023)</p>

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE &amp; REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government. This is NOT a Request for Quotations or Proposals. No solicitation document exists, and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses received to this RFI. The Government will not pay for any response or demonstration expenses. All costs incurred responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Failure to respond to this RFI will not preclude participation in any future solicitation. Any information received will become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. To aid DHS, please segregate any proprietary information. Responses to this RFI may be evaluated by Government technical experts drawn from staff within DHS and other Federal agencies. The Government may use selected support contractor personnel to assist in the evaluation of the RFI responses. These support contractors will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary. <br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) "Reverse Auction Tool" is envisioned as a web-based solution that assists the Department of Homeland Security Procurement Offices and customers in soliciting, evaluating, and awarding multiple contract types for supplies and select services from an established Reverse Auction Service Provider's (RASP) network of vendors (GWACs, BPAs and others).</p>
<p>The web-enabled reverse auctioning tool shall permit DHS procurement personnel, which includes both federal and contractor employees, to conduct real-time competed auctions for different contract vehicles. The tool allows employees to post online reverse auctions formatted as request for quotations (RFQ), utilize best value award criteria, low price technically acceptable, and establish auction start/end times. The system shall be versatile to allow buyers to have complete control of the bidding process to post auctions, cancel auctions at any time if it is in the best interest of the Government, and award to any vendor providing a quote in accordance with the established evaluation criteria. The reverse auction system website must be capable of simultaneous transactions in support of approximately 200+ users (buyers) creating/conducting numerous auctions among various vendors for an array of items.</p>

<DESC>CHARLESTON HARBOR EXPLORATORY ROCK CORE DRILLING, CHARLESTON COUNTY, SOUTH CAROLINA
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Charleston District, has a requirement for Exploratory Rock Core Drilling, Charleston Harbor, Charleston County, South Carolina. This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (market survey). This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This is not a follow-on contract. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought is to determine interest and capability of potential qualified Large Business, Small Business, Certified 8(a) Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business firm and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business firms relative to the North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 541380 Testing Laboratories. The Small Business Size Standard is $12 Million. To make an appropriate acquisition decision for the above project, the Government will use responses to this sources sought synopsis.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The purpose of this notice is to formally determine the availability of jack-up barge, or lift boat, for use in conducting rock-core drilling 7-20 miles off-shore within the Entrance Channel of Charleston Harbor. For reference, jack-up barges and lift boats are used in maritime environments to elevate the working platform above the water in order to isolate the workspace, equipment, and personnel from the tidal and wave swell. These vessels are very specialized, limited in quantity, and their demand is dictated by trends in maritime construction, salvage operations, and more recently, wind mill construction. They may be self-propelled (as in lift-boats), or they may be pushed by tug (as in lift barges). The specific purpose for the requested asset as it pertains to geotechnical drilling is to provide a stable work platform for USACE drillers that is isolated from wave action and to allow for accurate core drilling. The work is located in Charleston County, South Carolina.</p>
<p>Note: (1) If the decision is to Set-Aside this procurement for HUBZone Small Business, the contractor shall be required to perform in accordance to 13 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) SUBPART 126.700. (a) A qualified HUBZone Small Business receiving a HUBZONE contract for general construction must perform at least 15% of the contract either itself or through subcontracts with other qualified HUBZONE Small Business concerns.</p>
<p>Note: (2) If the decision is to Set-Aside this procurement for Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, the contractor shall be required to perform in accordance to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14 Limitation on Subcontracting (b) states, " The concern will perform at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees."</p>
<p>Completion time for this project will be specified in the solicitation. If the contractor fails to complete the work within the specified number of days, the contractor shall pay liquidated damages to the Government in the amount specified in the contract.</p>
<p>If you can meet all of the requirements for this project and the information in the questionnaire, please respond to this sources sought synopsis by email or mail to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Charleston District; Attention: Rose M. Smalls, 69A Hagood Avenue, Charleston, SC 29403. The e-mail address for Rose Smalls is william.wallace@usace.army.mil. Email is the preferred method when receiving responses to this synopsis. Response must be received no later than 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, on 21 March 2013.</p>
<p>Request that the following questions are answered in order to screen suitability of contractor for the project:<br /><br />1) What is the maximum height (above the seabed) that their jack-up barge/liftboat can attain? We will be operating in 55-feet of water with over 6 feet of tidal and wave swell. We need vessel that is high enough to keep waves off of the drilling operation. We will also need to know the length of the spuds as well for operational purposes.</p>
<p>2) Does the vessel contain a moon-pool? The moon-pool is an opening in the hull that allows drilling rod and bits to be lowered to the sea-floor.</p>
<p>3) Will the vessel require a tug or is it self-propelled? Tug usage and cost will have to be considered during pricing and estimation purposes.</p>
<p>4) Does the vessel meet Coast Guard safety standards for ocean going barge/ship? Operations will be conducted 7-20 miles offshore.</p>
<p>5) Does the vessel have onboard housing? If so, how many bunks will it support? This affects the logistics of drilling operations.</p>
<p>6) When is the vessel's earliest availability? Tentatively the drilling is to be conducted within the time period JUN-AUG, possibly to include SEP.</p>
<p>7) What is the dimension of the effective working area (without obstructions)? The ideal dimensions is a 50' x 15-20' area to allow parking of a drilling rig, space to walk around the rig, and enough room to lay down 10-20' of drilling rod.</p>
<p>8) Weight limitations? The estimated weight of the drilling rig loaded is 50,000 lbs. If the vessel cannot accommodate this weight, what can it accommodate?</p>
<p>9) What survey equipment do they have to locate the vessel, x and y, in SC state plane coordinates?</p>
<p>10) How will they determine the elevation, z, of the top of hole or the ocean bottom?</p>
<p>11) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) &amp; Commercial &amp; Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) (This information can be obtained from your Central Contractor Registration).</p>

<a href="mailto:crystal.m.chun@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Portland</a>
<DESC>TITLE: Juvenile Lamprey Tag Development Project <br>  <br> This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS in support of market research being conducted to identify capable potential sources, and to establish if this requirement can be competed on the open market.  This is NOT a request for quotes or proposals. <br>  <br>   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Portland District (Corps) is planning to start a new phase of development for a transmitter suitable for tagging Pacific Lamprey macropthalmia (Entosphenus tridentatus).  In the past, the Corps has developed a non-proprietary acoustic telemetry system for use in juvenile salmonids called the Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS).  The Corps is seeking a company that can create a similar transmitter for tagging Pacific Lamprey.  With the exception of acoustic frequency (417 kHz) and due to the small size needed, functional requirements will be based on the smallest transmitter possible.   <br>  <br> Elements of this project shall include:   <br> -	the development of the transmitters application space; 	 <br> -	identification of design alternatives;  <br> -	identification/development of the acoustic element;  <br> -	design of the electronics package;  <br> -	development of the power source;  <br> -	design of transmitter packaging;  <br> -	manufacturability and bio-effects testing on juvenile lamprey.   <br>  <br> As with previous development projects funded by the Corps, intellectual property including that already realized in previous development actions as well as any created during new development actions, will be managed to the benefit of the federal government.  <br>  <br> Contractors responding to this Sources Sought Notice shall submit the minimum information, as requested below, via email to Crystal Chun: crystal.m.chun@usace.army.mil  no later than (NLT) 24 May 2013 3:00PM.  Please no phone calls.  The NAICS code is 334220 and the PSC code is 5820. <br>  <br> General minimum information to submit is your Company Name, Point of Contact, Phone Number, Email Address, Mailing Address, DUNS Number, CAGE Code, and business size/socio-economic classification, and a capabilities statement indicating your ability to meet these requirements. <br>  <br>  <br> DRAFTED SCOPE OF WORK: <br> 1.	PROJECT REQUIREMENTS <br> 1.1 Application Space - The objectives and goals of the development effort, here called  quote mark application space quote mark  will be identified through an independent process in coordination with the Corps.  This process will involve those with responsibility for managing lamprey populations, others with knowledge about the behavior and biology of lamprey, and interested parties who may participate in public coordination processes.  The process of developing engineering specifications for a lamprey transmitter will be based on the identified application space.  The application space for juvenile lamprey is expected to be significantly different from that of juvenile salmonids due to the focus on animals with a very different body shape, physiology, and behavior. <br>  <br> 1.2 Acoustic Element - The acoustic element in the injectable JSATS is a custom designed piezoelectric ceramic (PZT or lead zirconate titanatelead).  The PZT element in this transmitter has an outer diameter of approximately 2.5mm and a length of approximately 1.8mm. Initial considerations of the likely size requirements for a juvenile lamprey transmitter have concluded that the acoustic element in the implantable JSATS transmitter is too large.  Development of the juvenile lamprey transmitter will require investigation of the material and operating properties of active element alternatives as constrained by other transmitter requirements. <br>  <br> 1.3 Electronics Package - The injectable JSATS transmitters have been designed using both custom designed ASICs (application specific integrated circuits) and microcontrollers.  It is not clear at this time what the preferred alternative will be for the electronic package for a juvenile lamprey transmitter because of likely requirements for much smaller size and other features needed to meet application space requirements.  The electronics package can include ASICs and other specialty elements that also meet expectations for manufacturability and cost.  The electronics package will need to provide for operation of the transmitter without breaching the transmitter's envelope and for the rigors of handling during transport, storage, and implantation. <br>  <br> 1.4 Power Source - The JSATS injectable transmitter included a micro-battery that met the size and energy requirements.  Development of a juvenile lamprey transmitter will likely require modification of the existing injectable battery or development of a new battery. <br>  <br> 1.5 Packaging - The micro transmitter sought is intended for longer-term implantation in the body of juvenile lamprey.  Packaging of the transmitter needs to consider protection of the transmitter from conditions within the body of lamprey and must also protect the lamprey from mechanical injury and from materials contained within the micro-transmitter.  Packaging may require the development of special handling considerations, access to special processes, chemicals, and machines as well as development of handling procedures and tools. <br>  <br> 1.6 Manufacturability - The product of the juvenile lamprey transmitter development will be complete documentation of the design as needed to meet Corps requirements for competitive procurement of production quantities of the lamprey transmitter.  The companies that have been successful in procurement actions for the current JSATS transmitters have a documented history in the manufacture of implantable fish micro-transmitters.  A requirement of the design of a juvenile lamprey transmitter is that the parts be procurable from commercial sources and that the assembly of the transmitter uses tools and processes familiar to the existing industry. <br>  <br> 1.7	Bio-Effects - Development of a juvenile lamprey transmitter will require assessment of the biological, physiological, and behavioral response of lamprey to the presence of the transmitter in addition to assessment of the tools and procedures required for its implantation.  Knowledge of lamprey biology in addition to husbandry and handling of lamprey in laboratory and field settings will be required to assess any bioeffects resulting from use of the lamprey transmitter for its intended purposes. <br>  <br> 2.	PROJECT DELIVERABLES <br> 2.1 Transmitter Specifications - For each element listed above detailed documentation on the developed transmitter shall be delivered to the Corps.  These include but are not limited to design drawings, board layouts, and manufacturers of transmitter components. <br>  <br> 2.2. Test Results - Detailed reports of testing reports shall be delivered to the Corps throughout the development process and summarized in the final project report. <br>  <br> 2.3. Intellectual Property - All intellectual property, both that already realized in previous development actions as well as any created during the new development actions shall be managed to the benefit of the federal government. <br>  <br>  <br> If you have questions for the Small Business Deputy for the Portland District Corps of Engineers, please contact Carol McIntyre at (503)808-4602 or carol.a.mcintyre@usace.army.mil. <br>  <br>

Request for Information VA701-13-I-0193
May 10, 2013

Introduction:
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  VA is currently conducting market research to locate qualified, experienced and interested potential sources.  Responses will not be considered proposals nor will any award be made by interested parties in responding to this Sources Sought announcement.  
Background: 
Wounded, Ill and Injured (WII) family members and designated Committed and Dedicated Representatives (CADRE) have difficulty locating benefits-related services and information on the internet and elsewhere.  They are forced to contact numerous organizations and websites with a 
variety of log-on requirements before locating information or support for their specific needs 
resulting in dissatisfaction with the process and delays in receiving needed benefits.  

A capability is required that leverages one pathway to provide information supporting the delivery of benefits to our WII service members, veterans, their family members, and designated CADRE. The capability will improve coordination across the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) self-service touch points and allow WII service members and veterans to actively participate in their recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration.  These improvements to inter-departmental coordination and systems access will increase efficiencies in the benefits determination process and improve customer satisfaction.
In order to promote a single source of comprehensive Personal Health Record (PHR) data for the user, there must be an alignment of the My HealtheVet (MHV) framework with the Bi-directional Health Information Exchange (BHIE) framework (which currently allows bi-directional data flows between VA and DoD systems), VistA web, or appropriate solution. This would allow a VA patient the ability to have access to their electronic medical records from VA and DoD. With the introduction of delegation through MHV, a VA patient would be able to grant access to their entire VA, DoD and self-entered records to any external provider of their choosing.
This project will result in the creation of the necessary project analysis and design documentation that will enable VA and DoD to establish bi-directional communication between their respective clinical repositories, other DoD systems, and the single common e-benefits portal presentation layer.  
Requirements:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires a contractor to provide technical support services to leverage one Internet-based pathway to provide information supporting the delivery of benefits to Wounded, Ill or Injured (WII) service members, veterans, their family members, and designated CADRE. The contractor shall tailor its efforts to meet the needs of the population being served.  At a minimum, the contractor shall provide the following: 
 a.	The Contractor shall provide an assessment of existing capabilities for the transport of web portal data for portability and interoperability for personal health records and electronic health records to include BHIE, VistAWeb, North Chicago Project, Madigan Project, Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN), and commercial industries.
b.	The Contractor shall provide a solution to transfer MHV eVault data to the electronic health record, the eBenefits portal (i.e. interoperability and portability of data) and to other outside PHRs (e.g., Microsoft, Google).  
c.	The Contractor shall provide technical services needed to make the information consumable by the user (i.e. look and feel and usability) for Veterans Administration and Department of Defense.
d.	The Contractor shall provide technical services for the development of PHR interface, integration, and delegation requirements.
e.	The Contractor shall provide a proof of concept of the recommended solution through implementing a pilot through the eBenefits portal.
Period of Performance:  
The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months after award.  
Submittal Information:  
Contractors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements should submit a response of no more than fifteen (15) pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum.  The Government will not review any other data or attachments that are in excess of the 15 pages.

If the company holds a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Contract, list the GSA Contract Number and relevant SINS.

Capabilities/Qualifications: A written response providing clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate the capacity to fulfill this requirement.  Description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possesses to perform services described in the scope of work. 
Past Experience: Brief summary of the company history relative to similar requirements. Offer may provide the following information on a maximum of three similar projects for which the responder was a prime or subcontractor.

<SUBJECT>Proposers' Day Announcement for IARPA's JANUS Program
<SOLNBR>IARPA-BAA-13-07
<RESPDATE>061013
<ARCHDATE>06112013
<CONTACT>Dr Mark J. Burge, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-13-07@iarpa.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for Janus on June 13, 2013 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 to 3:30 in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the Janus program and the research problems that the program aims to address, to address questions from potential proposers and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS</p>
<p>Intelligence analysts often rely on facial images to assist in establishing the identity of an individual, but too often, just examining the sheer volume of possibly relevant images and videos can be daunting. While biometric tools like automated face recognition could assist analysts in this task, current tools perform best on the well-posed, frontal facial photos taken for identification purposes. IARPA's Janus program aims to dramatically improve the current performance of face recognition tools by fusing the rich spatial, temporal, and contextual information available from the multiple views captured by today's "media in the wild".</p>
<p>The program is seeking to fund rigorous, high-quality research which uses innovative and promising approaches drawn from a variety of fields to develop novel representational models capable of encoding the shape, texture, and dynamics of a face. Instead of relying on a "single best frame approach," these representations must address the challenges of Aging, Pose, Illumination, and Expression (A-PIE) by exploiting all available imagery. Technologies must support analysts working with partial information by addressing the uncertainties which arise when working with possibly incomplete, erroneous, and ambiguous data. The goal of the program is to test and validate techniques which have the potential to significantly improve the performance of biometric recognition in unconstrained imagery, to that end, the program will involve empirical testing of recognition performance across unconstrained videos, camera stills, and scanned photos exhibiting a broad range of real-world imaging conditions.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that successful teams will transcend conventional approaches to biometric recognition by drawing on the multidisciplinary expertise of researchers from the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning; computer vision and image processing; computer graphics and animation; mathematical statistics and modeling; and data visualization and analytics.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm EST June 10th, 2013 at http://events.SignUp4.com/JANUSPD_Info. Directions to the conference facility and other materials will be available on that website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 150 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the conference. Non-US citizens will be required to submit a visit request form for Foreign Nationals at least 5 business days prior to the conference. The form and submission instructions can be found on the registration website. Foreign nationals will need to present a passport.</p>
<p><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The late morning and afternoon will include Presentation and Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present their organizations' capabilities and to explore teaming arrangements. Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for teaming opportunities may submit a request through the registration web site. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present, will be provided after approval to register for the conference has been granted. Time available for presentations and posters will be limited. Therefore, presentations will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request an oral presentation, and posters will be limited to the first 15 registered respondents who request a poster presentation. These presentations are not intended to solicit feedback from the Government, and Government personnel will not be present during the presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), or any other similar organizations that have a special relationship with the Government, that gives them access to privileged or proprietary information, or access to Government equipment or real property, will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>

It is believed that the following equipment is proprietary, and thus the necessary repairs can only be performed by a single entity. <br>  <br> * Three (3) unmanned ground vehicles, off-road capability <br> * Two (2) towed tank targets, mounted on a trailer system <br>  <br> These items were purchased from Coastal Defense, Inc., Mill Hall, PA, by the US Army Flight Training Detachment (Peace Vanguard) in support of a foreign military sales training association.  The ultimate end user of these targets and associated equipment is the Republic of Singapore Air Force.  The items are currently located at the Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field, Gila Bend, AZ. <br>  <br> The target vehicles, both remote and towed, are in need of repairs to be fully operational for a training exercise in late June 2013.  The remote controlled vehicles are operated by an on-site ground control station with a camera system for steering, with operational capability at up to 10 miles from the ground station.  Vehicles are maneuverable at speeds of 0-60 MPH, with remote controlled breaking and starting systems. <br>  <br> Repairs of the on-board electrical systems will be extensive, along with the need for additional mechanical parts to bring all the vehicles up to full operational capability. <br>  <br> In addition to necessary repairs, the contractor will need to provide operational support with sufficient staffing to repair and then operate the unmanned ground vehicles for a minimum of two (2) operational elements.  The anticipated length of time necessary for repairs and exercise assistance is one (1) week.  At the conclusion of the exercise, the contractor will be required to assist with disposal of the targets or vehicles as necessary, with appropriate unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance processing. <br>  <br> The anticipated value of this procurement is $70-75,000. <br>  <br> CONTRACTING OFFICE: USPFO for Arizona, ATTN: NGAZ-PFO-PC, 5645 E.

Response Date: May 20, 2013  2:00pm EST.
In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development,  intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to Life Technologies Corporation to purchase Various supplies in support of MERB research.    The justification is as follows:   Life Technologies is the only company who sells the exact products. (see attached quote).  The products are already being used in ongoing studies so there is a need to purchase more to finish the studies and maintain quality control.  If  asked to order reagents from another company, there is no way to know if the ingredients are the same as they are not fully disclosed by the company.  If laboratory results are not as expected then there is no way to know if its due to the change in reagents or another factor.  The need to eliminate as many variables as possible is very important.  In order to maintain the integrity of the studies, the requirements office needs to have t his order placed through Life Technologies. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within ten (10) calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Ron Bell via the e-mail link below. 
NO phone calls please.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ); IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. <br>  <br> 1.0 DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future RFP will not be entertained.  <br>  <br> 2.0 SUBJECT: The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) is conducting market research to assess the commercial availability or technical maturity of technologies that are capable of satisfying the capability gap for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases (ID) in austere environments.  Moreover, the USAMRMC wishes to receive industry comment on both the commercial interest and the commercial viability of diagnostic devices capable of meeting our needs, inclusive of affordability given the projected Department of Defense (DoD) demand.  Attachment 1 describes the USAMRMC Target Product Profile (TPP) for ID diagnostic capabilities.  Of note is the Key Performance Parameter (KPP) of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance. Commensurate with this parameter, respondents should strongly consider associated development cost, post FDA-clearance costs, and overall commercial viability both globally and in the US market in order to determine if candidate products can be sustained in a way that is both profitable to the company and affordable by the DoD.   <br>  <br> 3.0 Background: In the absence of approved prophylactic drugs and vaccines, prevention and early diagnosis remain the best option to mitigate the impact of certain ID pathogens in US Service Members.  The USAMRMC has a need to develop and field (in a sustainable and affordable manner) forward-deployable, rapid, ID diagnostics that meet or exceed the specifications listed in Attachment 1.  Recently, the USAMRMC prioritized diseases and pathogens of interest for rapid diagnostic devices (see Table 1).   This table, although not comprehensive, lists those IDs for which diagnostics are needed based on military end-user desirability and potential impact.  Additionally, Table 1 lists the anticipated DoD annual purchase quantities .  Note: Table 1 depicts the diseases and pathogens that are the USAMRMC's top priorities.  However, the USAMRMC also has interest in developing other ID diagnostic capabilities that are not included in the table.  Procurement quantities are subject to change and industry should comment on the feasibility of sustaining the capability on the US market given the procurement quantity listed.   <br>  <br> Prior to determining the acquisition strategy, the USAMRMC must assess the commercial market for availability and maturity of commercially developed ID diagnostic candidates that are both rapid and forward-deployable (henceforth referred to as  quote mark candidates quote mark ) and gauge industry interest in developing these candidates for the US market.  Moreover, the USAMRMC must ensure that a sufficient US market and industry interest (in that market) exists to warrant investment in development and (more importantly) sustainment of these candidates (following FDA-clearance) at quantities and cost that are sustainable in the marketplace and affordable to the USAMRMC.  <br>  <br> Specifically, the USAMRMC is interested in determining the following: <br> A. candidate diagnostic products, either in the development pipeline or currently marketed in the US or in foreign markets, that  can be used to diagnose the USAMRMC ID Pathogen Priorities shown in Table 1.   <br> B. the current status of each candidate <br> C. how specifications of each candidate compare with the USAMRMC threshold/objective specifications (Attachment 1) <br> D. why or why not pursuit of  FDA clearance and the US marketing is or is not being currently considered <br> E. the support interested industry sources will require from the DoD (technical and scientific expertise, clinical sites, research and development financial support, procurement needs (projected US market cost, projected sustainment quantity), etc.)  <br>  <br> In addition, the USAMRMC wishes to obtain industry feedback on strategies by which candidate assays can be combined, kitted, or otherwise optimized such that logistical burden can be minimized and greater affordability can be achieved in the long term.  For example: Creatively packaging individual assay capabilities together may promote cost savings and affordability.   Please share perspectives on different strategies that the MRMC may want to consider.  <br>  <br> Table 1: See Attachment 1 for Table 1 <br>  <br> Ultimately, in order for the USAMRMC to be able to field a candidate, it must meet or exceed the specifications listed in Attachement 1: FDA-cleared, no greater than moderate complexity, usable in austere environments (without the requirement for electricity or for ancillary laboratory equipment not provided with the diagnostic test), relatively small and lightweight, fielded with external controls, and provide results rapidly.  Please refer to Attachment 1 for a complete list of specifications.  It is preferred that the candidates will be usable by medical personnel (such as a medic or physician assistant) without specialized medical laboratory technician training (i.e., the test is CLIA-waived or capable of being CLIA-waived). In addition to technical performance and affordability, the USAMRMC is also interested in several non-technical issues and strategic concerns. Ultimately, the USAMRMC wishes to obtain industry feedback in order to assess the viability and affordability of developing and maintaining a supply of ID diagnostic capabilities that meet specifications.  Respondents should address these items as explained in Section 4.0.  <br>  <br> 4.0 Response Instructions: <br>  <br> Respondents should address the following in their submission: <br> A. Name and address of company <br> B. Names and contact information of key company personnel <br>  <br> Note: For items a through l, please focus on those candidates that correspond with ID pathogen priorities listed in Table 1and provide responses for each candidate proposed.  <br>  <br> C. Description of  each ID diagnostic candidate currently in development that is (or will be) capable of meeting or exceeding the specifications in Attachment 1 to include:  <br> a. Name of proposed candidate(s) <br> b. Intended use or proposed intended use <br> c. Technical Description: A brief technical description explaining the technology utilized and manufacturing methods used and anticipated (or proven) sensitivity and specificity. Please also include information about the ability of the technology to multiplex (e.g. detect both pathogen Ag and human Ig; as applicable). <br> d. Description of Packaging/Kit: Either current or proposed <br> e. Ancillary Equipment/Consumables: Description of any equipment and consumables required to utilize the assay kit; indicating if each item is included with the kit (or not). <br> f. Package Insert (if available)  <br> g. Candidate Maturity: Please describe the clearance status of the candidate to include (as applicable) FDA-clearance status and/or any clearance/obtained marketing permits for use in foreign countries. If not yet FDA-cleared, please specify an estimated time frame for achieving FDA clearance.  <br> h. Projected selling price range per assay (please specify ranges for both US and foreign markets).  It will be assumed that the US market price range will reflect the selling price to the DoD. Costs for the US market should be inclusive of external controls. <br> i. Projected US and foreign market sales <br> j. Projected annual US market sales volume (# of assays) needed to sustain the assay in the US market, at the price range described in item h. <br> k. Minimum batch/production run size (# of assays / batch) <br> l. Willingness to pursue FDA clearance and the US market <br>  <br> D. Narrative:  Please describe the barriers to market entry as you see them and any suggestions on how the DoD can help to make rapid diagnostic development more sustainable. To that end, explain and/or answer the following:  <br> a. Willingness/interest in co-developing ID diagnostic candidates with the DoD  <br> b. General capabilities and limitations of your company that may require assistance from the USAMRMC <br> c. Willingness and ability to serve as the regulatory sponsor (510(k) holder)  <br> d. Description/explanation of availability and/or development of external positive controls, which is a requirement for fielding within the military.  <br> e. Feasibility of and willingness to pursue CLIA-waived status (in general) of candidates that have the potential to meet Attachment 1 specifications.  Comment on whether CLIA-waived devices are within your strategic plans. Why or why not? <br> f. Please comment on the overall market and sales with emphasis on US market and sustaining that market.  Include commentary on continuing to market such candidates in the US both with and without DOD demand. Specifically, is the capability sustainable in the US market at the DoD demand levels depicted in Table 1?  If not, what is a more realistic DoD demand that the USAMRMC should consider?   <br> g. Please describe (in general) any concerns you may have involving the sustainability of ID diagnostic products that meet or exceed USAMRMC specifications given the size of both US and foreign markets, and your anticipated profit margins.  Expand on issues that you think the USAMRMC should consider in further considering development and acquisition strategy in terms of the potential to decrease unit cost and achieve better overall sustainability.   <br> h. Please describe any developmental or commercial partnerships and/or relationships that would facilitate development and fielding/supply to the US market.   <br>  <br> 5.0 CONTACT INFORMATION: Any and all questions related to this RFI shall be directed to Shannyn Scassero at shannyn.scassero.civ@mail.mil.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Douglas Lowrey, at douglas.lowrey@us.army.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.
As prescribed in 1346.503, insert the following clause: Place of Acceptance (APR 2010) (a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract. (b) The place of acceptance will be:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-66 effective April 1, 2013. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), and Acquisition of Commercial Items. The Solicitation Number for this acquisition is P-13-007113 and is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This is&nbsp;a small business set aside.<br /><br />Background Information<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's foremost federally funded biomedical research institution. It comprises 27 institutes and centers. The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is the 240-bed clinical research hospital where the institutes and centers carry out early-phase clinical research studies in Bethesda, Maryland.
<p>The CC is the setting for NIH intramural clinical research program. Research participants are admitted to the CC or seen in its outpatient clinics for the sole purpose of participating in clinical research trials. The CC admits patients from all over the world for clinical trials and natural history studies. The CC accommodates about 10,000 new patients and 100,000 outpatient visits a year. There are about 1,500 clinical research protocols in progress.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement</p>
<p>The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 stipulates that information about all NIH-funded clinical trials must be on an accessible online database and they must be written in NIH CC understandable lay language. To comply with this legislation, the NIH CC has a requirement for a contractor with extensive experience and demonstrated skill in editing complex protocol documents into plain language that can be easily understood by the general public; using plain language standards to write summaries of complex protocol documents that are easily understood by the general public; and editing scientific manuscripts for medical and scientific journals or for lay publications.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>1. The contractor will produce approximately 150 and lay titles in plain, lay language during the contract period according to requirements below. The summaries will be drawn from final and approved protocol and consent documents provided by the CC.</p>
<p>2. Contractor will edit protocol consents documents into easily understandable lay language according to requirements below.</p>
<p>3. Contractor will edit scientific manuscripts for scientific and lay audiences as needed.</p>
<p>4.

About 10% of the work will involve editing free-standing consent documents and scientific manuscripts.</p>
<p>For the writing of summaries and lay titles, protocols and their associated consent documents will be transferred from NIH to vendor and returned by vendor to NIH using the Clinical Center's FTP mechanism. Other documents will be transferred in Microsoft Word format via email or in hard copy via mail.</p>
<p>Protocol summaries/lay titles will be completed and returned by the vendor within three business days after the vendor receives the original documents. Final documents will be delivered weekdays only. A document's length and complexity may affect turnaround times, and if additional time is needed to complete writing and editing, contractor must notify NIH within one business day of receipt and agree to an alternative delivery timeframe, not to exceed six business days. <br />The lay title for protocol summaries is limited to 300 characters including spaces and the summary to 5000 characters, including spaces.</p>

Subject matter expert will review documents before final distribution. If errors are found on more than three documents a month, (this contract will be terminated).</p>
<p>Vendor must determine and follow specific style guides for writing and editing.<br />Reading level for protocol summaries and consents will be at 8th grade. Vendor will assess reading level by using a commonly accepted tool, typically the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score associated with Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>The protocol summaries must not include certain symbols. Text alternatives vendor will use are:</p>
<p>Tabs<br />Accents <br />&beta;=beta sign<br />a=alpha sign<br />&gamma;=Gamma sign<br />&zeta;=Zeta sign<br />&bull; Bullets<br />@ at sign<br />&amp; and <br />&copy;<br />&le; less than or equal to<br />&ge; greater than or equal to<br />&micro;= micro<br />&dagger;= cross<br />&ordm; = Degree<br />Subscripts<br />Superscripts<br />Na&#970;ve - replace &#970; with i <br />Backward E = possible existent<br />n-3 = omega 3</p>
<p>The following symbols should not be used in the lay title:<br />&amp; ampersand<br />{ open bracket<br />} close bracket<br />| pipe<br />+ plus sign<br />&plusmn; plus and minus<br />With or without<br />More or less<br />%Percentage<br />~ guiggle<br />^ hat<br />\ backslash<br />.. chains =<br />n- before numeral to signify fatty acid terminology<br />Vendor will also provide editing for approximately 20 scientific manuscripts and scientific presentations by CC physicians and scientists, which are prepared for submission to various scientific journals.</p>

<DESC>The overall goal of the program is to build a more effective and competent Palestinian justice sector that is accountable to the public and responds to citizens' needs. The objectives of this program are to enhance efficiency of targeted justice sector institutions; improve service delivery provided by justice sector institutions; enhance education and management systems of legal education; support the development of Family Courts; promote the concept of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) services; develop inter-institutional coordination among justice institutions; and increase citizen engagement in rule of law issues. This program will focus on core public functions within justice sector institutions and require a flexible mix of technical assistance, training, equipment, and other assistance. Ethics and anti-corruption will be cross-cutting themes of the program. The program will support the Palestinian Authority's commitment to strengthen and reform government institutions, and will focus on supporting visible improvements in the delivery of services that contribute towards increased public confidence.

However, only Realty Specialists of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) have the authority to request alterations or improvements to the leased space. If the Government pays for the improvements, a Supplemental Agreement (SA) to the lease shall be prepared by the COE Realty Specialist as follows. The Realty Specialist shall provide the construction specifications for the improvements and the Lessor shall then provide a construction cost estimate, which shall be subjected to an Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) review to ensure that fair market value is achieved. If the estimate satisfies the IGCE review, no other bids are required. The contractor shall then be selected and an SA detailing specifications and cost shall be prepared by the Realty Specialist. Once the SA is signed by the lessor it shall be routed to the Chief of the Fort Worth COE Real Estate Division, or other duly authorized Contracting Officer, for execution. An executed original copy shall be sent to the Lessor and the Lessor shall then direct the selected contractor to proceed. Work should never be started before the Lessor receives an executed SA. When the work is completed and accepted by the Government, the lump sum payment (if applicable) shall be released to the Lessor. If the cost of the improvements is $2,000.00 or less, the government may pay for the improvements by credit card and an SA would not be required. <br>  <br> ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION - SLAT LEASES (SEP 2010) <br> A.

<DESC>The Portland OR VA Medical Center (PVAMC) is seeking the following professional services:

Project Scope: 
This contract is required because Portland Path&Lab (PLMS) needs reference lab services for Nasal Swap and Bronchial Alveolar Lavage specimen types using Respiratory Viral Panel on the Luminex.  PLMS usually does this testing in house.  Although, because of the sensitivity and complexity of our testing platform, the testing platform is at times unavailable.  To insure test results from reference labs correlate with our in-house results, both labs shall use the exact same platform.  In other words, the contractor methodology/platform shall mirror PVAMC PLMS methodology/platform. Our test methodology/ platform is Luminex 100 xTagTM technology with quantitative results as opposed to qualitative results. The targets for the Luminex 100 xTagTM are different than the targets other methodologies.  For the past several years, when our instrument has been down PVAMC has partnered with Viracor-IBT Laboratories to have these test performed using Nucleic acid based methods.  Historically, traditional methods such as direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) assay and culture methods have been used to assist physicians in diagnosing viral respiratory tract infections.  Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification has shown greater sensitivity than DFA and culture with the additional ability to detect the presence of multiple and emerging viruses rapidly.   The ability of Viracor to identify a particular virus quickly and specifically as the etiologic agent for syndromic diseases like bronchiolitis and pneumonia has been demonstrated to result in reduced hospital stays, decreased use of unnecessary antibiotics, and elimination of superfluous diagnostic procedures and laboratory tests.

Firms offering a response to this notice should ensure that their registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ is current and should ensure that the applicable NAICS code (621511) is included in the SAM profile prior to submission of quotations.

Method of Award - Cascade Procedure
1. Any award resulting from this solicitation shall be made using the following cascade order of precedence:
1.1. In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.14 and PL 109-461, award under this solicitation shall be made on a competitive basis first to an eligible Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business (SDVOSB) concern, provided that there is adequate competition among such firms.
1.2. If there is inadequate competition for award to a SDVOSB concern, award shall be made competitively to an eligible Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) concern.
1.3. If there is inadequate competition for award to a VOSB concern, award shall be made competitively to an 8a or HubZone small business concern.
1.4. If there is inadequate competition for award to an 8a or HubZone concern, award shall be made competitively to a small business concern IAW FAR 19.5.
1.5. If there is inadequate competition for award to a small business concern, award shall be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all responsive offers submitted by responsible business concerns.

The anticipated Base period of this contract shall be from date of award, through 09/30/2013.  There shall be 4 possible option years to exercise, depending on the needs of the VA.  The solicitation will result in the award of a single contract.  

Interested parties are encouraged contact Jos Ronstadt, Contract Specialist, at jose.ronstadt@va.gov.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. personal services contracts (USPSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 15 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI is an exciting, fast-paced, operational office in USAID. Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI PSC staff are deployed and supported expeditiously and programs started quickly, often with little or no lead time.  The Administrative Assistant position is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support.  To achieve this, OTI requires an Administrative Assistant who has the capacity to work well within a team environment and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit.</p>
<p>The Administrative Assistant works closely with other Administrative Assistants and other members of the Operations and Management Division (OMD) as well as the OTI Country Program teams to ensure OTI programs are provided with outstanding administrative support.  The Administrative Assistant has responsibility for daily administrative operations in support of OTI program-funded staff in Washington and the field.  Approximately 95% of the workload will be in support of program-funded staff and activities in OTI/Washington and the field, and approximately 5% of the workload will also be in support of Direct Hire staff in Washington and the field. Key functions of the Administrative Assistant are to provide general administrative support to a majority program-funded staff, and provide backup support to the other Administrative Assistants and Personnel Assistants in OTI in their absence.</p>
<p>This is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations.  For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support.  The incumbent must have a strong sense of responsibility, a high customer service standard, be highly organized, pay close attention to detail, and be able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The purpose of this solicitation is to hire an Administrative Assistant within OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD).</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16FAM 116 available at http://transition.usaid.gov/business/business_opportunities/cib/pdf/aapd06_10.pdf</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<p>Attn: Jorge Molina &amp; Nelson Contreras<br />Phone: 56-2-421-3578<br />Fax: 56-2-421-3660</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to the Undersecretariat of Telecommunications of Chile ("Subtel" or "Grantee") in the planning of a National Emergency Network ("NEN" or "Project").</p>
<p>The NEN is an important component of the efforts of the Government of Chile ("GOC"), on a variety of fronts, to enhance national emergency and disaster response capabilities. Subtel is a GOC agency tasked with oversight over the telecommunications and ICT sectors. The NEN will serve as a common communications facility that will ensure uninterrupted operation under a wide range of emergency and disaster scenarios, while at the same time enabling interconnection and interoperability of existing and future emergency communications networks, thus providing a unified platform.</p>
<p>This Technical Assistance will involve the diagnostic of the national emergency networks, the desired model definition, the gaps identification (between current and desired model), the medium and long term plan to accomplish it, and finally, an RFP for a tender, while a second phase, which is not part of this Technical Assistance, will cover the acquisition of equipment.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $514,548 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp.</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal, in both English and Spanish, directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00PM local (Santiago) time, May 27, 2013</span></strong>, at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p>Interested parties desiring to do business with the Air Force must register in the System for Award Management (SAM), https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. SAM is the Official U.S. Government system that consolidated the capabilities of CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS. Interested parties should ensure any potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest have been, or are in the process of being mitigated. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this NOCA nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided. This notice is not a commitment from the Government. Potential Offerors are reminded that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government. Once the RFP for the GAP CIE effort is posted, all correspondence concerning this effort shall be with the Contracting Officer only. Please direct any questions regarding this notice to Mr. Lee Smales, Contracting Officer at 402-232-7367, or email smalesl@stratcom.mil.</p>
<p>An AFLCMC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from Offerors, potential Offerors, and others for this acquisition.

<strong>Original Posting: Nov 20, 2012<br /></strong>The Global Adaptive Planning Collaborative Information Environment (GAP CIE) is a web-based, collaborative Joint Operation Planning (JOP) tool that supports distributed participants in multiple security enclaves (primarily SIPRNET and JWICS at present). GAP CIE is comprised of two functional components supported by commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software products: the GAP CIE planning environment, and the Global Situational Awareness Tool (GSAT). GSAT provides situational awareness of global events in a sharable, user-defined operational picture for viewing geospatial, temporal, relational, and COA planning data. GSAT allows a look at a battlespace and permits the visualization of real data from authoritative systems of record and other approved sources. The GAP CIE portion provides Deliberate Planning, Crisis Action Planning, and Decision Support tools. Both allow subject matter experts to share situational awareness and collaboratively build integrated, macro COAs. The system automates the construction of orders, messages, and status and decision briefs, freeing planners from format management and focusing their efforts on plan and information quality. The purpose of the GAP CIE Sustainment Program is to provide sustainment, enhancement, and modification deliveries to fielded Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) GAP CIE Block 1 and Increment 2 capabilities.

<DESC><strong><em>10 May 13, 1150 hours, To Whom it May Concern, <br /><br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE!&nbsp; The due dates for the Sources Sought&nbsp;is 29 May 13 NOT 15 May 13 as stated in paragraphs 8 and 11 below.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have corrected these in the announcement set forth below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Francis M. Eggert, PCO. <br /><br />=== See Corrected Dates below&nbsp; ====<br /><br /></em></strong><br />9 May 13.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />SUBJECT: MARKET RESEARCH SURVEY FOR THE MERCURY ATOMIC FREQUENCY STANDARD (MAFS)
<p>REFERENCE NUMBER: FA9453-13-R-0331</p>
<p>1. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is conducting market research to identify industries that have the capabilities and capacity related to a Mercury Atomic Frequency Standard. This Sources Sought seeks sources capable of taking existing and developed technical designs and information from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC), and improve the manufacturing processes to meet the Air Force's requirements for GPS (radiation hardening, lifetime, performance, etc.), and producing an initial number of the Mercury Atomic Frequency Standard (MAFS) for testing purposes and for potential future flight(s). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code expected is Manufacturing: 336414 with some possible Research and Development too per NAICS Code: 541712. The Small Business size standard is expected to be 1000.</p>
<p>2. NASA's DSAC was developed, and designed to demonstrate the space flight performance of a small, low-mass, high-stability mercury-ion atomic clock with long term stability and accuracy on par with that of the Deep Space Network. The DSAC is a Mercury ion clock based on the ground state hyperfine transition in trapped 199Hg ions. See the attached Figure 1, which is a diagram of the Mercury trapped ion atomic clock.</p>
<p>3. The following documents provide an overview of NASA's DSAC and are attached for you to read:</p>
<p>A. T. Ely, J. Seubert, J. Prestage, and R. Tjoelker, The Deep Space Atomic Clock: Ushering in a New Paradigm for Radio Navigation and Science, (2013) (Preprint) AAS 13-325, See and read Attachment 1. Note, See Figure 1 of this Preprint from NASA.</p>
<p>B. T. Ely, T. Koch, D. Kuang, K. Lee, D. Murphy, J. Prestage, R. Tjoelker, and J. Seubert, The Deep Space Atomic Clock Mission, (2012), from NASA, See and read Attachment 2.</p>
<p>C. NOTE! Potential sources SHALL comply with a DD Form 254, GPS Security Classification Guide Dated 20 Sep 2008, and DoD GPS Security Policy dated 4 Apr 2006 along with its Interim International Supplement dated 4 Apr 2006 in order to be considered for potential work efforts. Some of these documents are classified as: DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT "D": Distribution authorized to DoD and U.S. DoD contractors only. Other requests for this document shall be referred to Air Force Research Laboratory/(RVBYE, Attn: Capt Foo or Dr. Burke), 3550 Aberdeen Ave SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5776. See and read Attachment 3.</p>
<p>4. A vendor supporting this task would take NASA's DSAC and convert it to meet the Air Force's requirements. Specifically this will entail meeting radiation hardening requirements, meeting GPS constellation requirements, and improving the manufacturability of the clock. An interested vendor should have experience in taking laboratory built equipment and making that equipment more manufacturable to include, but not limited to, using parts that are easy to obtain or manufacture, improving or eliminating costly production steps, and developing easy to follow manufacturing processes. With respect to the GPS constellation requirements, the MAFS will have reduced Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements, have simplified external interfaces, and will need to meet increased lifetime requirements, reliability requirements, performance standards, and space flight qualification requirements to include all vibration, thermal, radiation, and other space flight specific characteristics. The task will include producing initial engineering units for test purposes and then flight units for an initial demonstration.</p>
<p>5. This task is limited to US contractors only and all employees working on MAFS must be US citizens. Due to restrictions on technical data, this is an initial capabilities call. Companies with the capability to support this effort will send their information to the contracting officer.</p>
<p>This information shall include the following:</p>
<p>A. Full company name, mailing address, name of technical point of contact with contact information (phone and e-mail), name of program management point of contact with contact information (phone and e-mail), and company cage code, and NAICS Code(s) for producing the product(s).</p>
<p>B. A description of any previous experience related to taking a laboratory produced item and improving upon its construction processes to make it more easy to manufacture the product.</p>
<p>C. A description of experience in designing, building, and testing space qualified devices.</p>
<p>D. Evidence of your established manufacturing processes and equipment and facilities for producing and testing of items. Evidence needs to show how it applies to MAFS.</p>
<p>6. The government will review this information and verify that companies submitting capability and capacity statements meet security requirements. The security requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Foreign businesses are not allowed to participate in this effort as this technology is export controlled. Only US businesses are authorized to participate.</p>
<p>B. Employees working on this effort must be US citizens. No foreign nationals will be <br />allowed to support this effort.</p>
<p><br />The government may follow up with submitting companies to request additional information. Companies that meet the requirements will then be sent further technical information in order to produce rough order magnitude cost and schedule estimates, list any major cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and unique milestone schedule considerations, and list any utilization of subcontractors with the proper security clearances, if applicable.</p>
<p>7. All submissions must be UNCLASSIFIED. Classified submissions will NOT be accepted. Please submit responses using the most current versions of Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and or Excel on two disks with three (3) hard copies for review. Do not send e-mails, because the government &lsquo;firewalls' may delete attachments. The technical portion of the response should be limited to 20 pages, using standard Times or Times New Roman font and no smaller than 12 point with one inch margins, single spaced.</p>

Eggert, PCO. <br /><br />=== See Corrected Dates below&nbsp; ====<br /><br /></em></strong><br />9 May 13.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />SUBJECT: MARKET RESEARCH SURVEY FOR THE MERCURY ATOMIC FREQUENCY STANDARD (MAFS)
<p>REFERENCE NUMBER: FA9453-13-R-0331</p>
<p>1. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is conducting market research to identify industries that have the capabilities and capacity related to a Mercury Atomic Frequency Standard. This Sources Sought seeks sources capable of taking existing and developed technical designs and information from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC), and improve the manufacturing processes to meet the Air Force's requirements for GPS (radiation hardening, lifetime, performance, etc.), and producing an initial number of the Mercury Atomic Frequency Standard (MAFS) for testing purposes and for potential future flight(s). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code expected is Manufacturing: 336414 with some possible Research and Development too per NAICS Code: 541712. The Small Business size standard is expected to be 1000.</p>
<p>2. NASA's DSAC was developed, and designed to demonstrate the space flight performance of a small, low-mass, high-stability mercury-ion atomic clock with long term stability and accuracy on par with that of the Deep Space Network. The DSAC is a Mercury ion clock based on the ground state hyperfine transition in trapped 199Hg ions. See the attached Figure 1, which is a diagram of the Mercury trapped ion atomic clock.</p>
<p>3. The following documents provide an overview of NASA's DSAC and are attached for you to read:</p>
<p>A. T. Ely, J. Seubert, J. Prestage, and R. Tjoelker, The Deep Space Atomic Clock: Ushering in a New Paradigm for Radio Navigation and Science, (2013) (Preprint) AAS 13-325, See and read Attachment 1. Note, See Figure 1 of this Preprint from NASA.</p>
<p>B. T. Ely, T. Koch, D. Kuang, K. Lee, D. Murphy, J. Prestage, R. Tjoelker, and J. Seubert, The Deep Space Atomic Clock Mission, (2012), from NASA, See and read Attachment 2.</p>
<p>C. NOTE! Potential sources SHALL comply with a DD Form 254, GPS Security Classification Guide Dated 20 Sep 2008, and DoD GPS Security Policy dated 4 Apr 2006 along with its Interim International Supplement dated 4 Apr 2006 in order to be considered for potential work efforts. Some of these documents are classified as: DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT "D": Distribution authorized to DoD and U.S. DoD contractors only. Other requests for this document shall be referred to Air Force Research Laboratory/(RVBYE, Attn: Capt Foo or Dr. Burke), 3550 Aberdeen Ave SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5776. See and read Attachment 3.</p>
<p>4. A vendor supporting this task would take NASA's DSAC and convert it to meet the Air Force's requirements. Specifically this will entail meeting radiation hardening requirements, meeting GPS constellation requirements, and improving the manufacturability of the clock. An interested vendor should have experience in taking laboratory built equipment and making that equipment more manufacturable to include, but not limited to, using parts that are easy to obtain or manufacture, improving or eliminating costly production steps, and developing easy to follow manufacturing processes. With respect to the GPS constellation requirements, the MAFS will have reduced Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) requirements, have simplified external interfaces, and will need to meet increased lifetime requirements, reliability requirements, performance standards, and space flight qualification requirements to include all vibration, thermal, radiation, and other space flight specific characteristics. The task will include producing initial engineering units for test purposes and then flight units for an initial demonstration.</p>
<p>5. This task is limited to US contractors only and all employees working on MAFS must be US citizens. Due to restrictions on technical data, this is an initial capabilities call. Companies with the capability to support this effort will send their information to the contracting officer.</p>
<p>This information shall include the following:</p>
<p>A. Full company name, mailing address, name of technical point of contact with contact information (phone and e-mail), name of program management point of contact with contact information (phone and e-mail), and company cage code, and NAICS Code(s) for producing the product(s).</p>
<p>B. A description of any previous experience related to taking a laboratory produced item and improving upon its construction processes to make it more easy to manufacture the product.</p>
<p>C. A description of experience in designing, building, and testing space qualified devices.</p>
<p>D. Evidence of your established manufacturing processes and equipment and facilities for producing and testing of items. Evidence needs to show how it applies to MAFS.</p>
<p>6. The government will review this information and verify that companies submitting capability and capacity statements meet security requirements. The security requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Foreign businesses are not allowed to participate in this effort as this technology is export controlled. Only US businesses are authorized to participate.</p>
<p>B. Employees working on this effort must be US citizens. No foreign nationals will be <br />allowed to support this effort.</p>
<p><br />The government may follow up with submitting companies to request additional information. Companies that meet the requirements will then be sent further technical information in order to produce rough order magnitude cost and schedule estimates, list any major cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and unique milestone schedule considerations, and list any utilization of subcontractors with the proper security clearances, if applicable.</p>
<p>7. All submissions must be UNCLASSIFIED. Classified submissions will NOT be accepted. Please submit responses using the most current versions of Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and or Excel on two disks with three (3) hard copies for review. Do not send e-mails, because the government &lsquo;firewalls' may delete attachments. The technical portion of the response should be limited to 20 pages, using standard Times or Times New Roman font and no smaller than 12 point with one inch margins, single spaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>8. </em></strong>The complete submission must be sent to the Contracting Officer no later than Noon (Mountain Standard Time - MST) <strong><em>on 29&nbsp;May 2013 not 15 May 13.&nbsp; (Correction). &nbsp; </em></strong>Foreign firms are advised they will NOT be allowed to participate as the prime contractor or as a first-tier subcontractor.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  The Mission and Installation Contracting Command-Fort Bragg (MICC-FB), North Carolina intends to procure LP Gas as a supply acquisition - not a service acquistion.  MICC-FB has a requirement for a contractor to provide bulk propane to be delivered to approximately 122 Government-owned propane tanks located on Fort Bragg, Camp MacKall, Pope and Simmons Army Airfield, North Carolina. The conceptual acquisition strategy is to establish a requirements type contract with a five (5) year ordering period.  It is the Government's intent to order approximately 350,000 gallons of propane each year (1,750,000.00 GALLONS over the conceptual 5-yr ordering period), approximately 29,166 gallons a month, with a two (2)-hour expected delivery timeframe. The contractor is expected to refill the Government-owned propane tanks, which range in size from 57 gallons to 36,000 gallon tanks on a monthly basis.  <br>  This requirement was determined to be classified under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 325120 with a size standard of 500 Employees.    <br>  This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) Solicitation. There will be no public bid opening.   <br> It is anticipated that an IFB will be posted electronically on or about 31 May 2013 to the Federal Business Opportunities webpage at http://www.fbo.gov. Paper copies will not be available. Once the IFB Solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon all interested parties to review this site frequently for any update/amendments to any and all documents.  All prospective Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), which is the Official U.S. Government system that consolidated the capabilities of CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS.  There is NO fee to register for this site.  Entities may register at no cost directly from their webpage at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.  <br> This Pre-Solicitation Notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid preparation costs.  Questions concerning this acquisition will be allowed after the official posting of the IFB.  All questions shall be directed toward Contract Specialist, Khristina M. Matthews at khristina.m.matthews.civ@mail.mil and Contracting Officer, Anna M. Walker at anna.m.walker.civ@mail.mil.   However, questions are not being accepted at this time.   <br>    <br>    <br>  <br>

<DESC>Department of Veteran Affairs, Network 11 Contract Office, 1900 East Main Street, Danville, IL issued the Invitation for Bid No. VA251-12-B-0361 for Project No. 583-12-179 at the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center, 1481 West 10th Street, Indianapolis, IN.  The purpose of the solicitation was to install a new garage entrance gate system.  
The solicitation was issued on November 2, 2012 as a total set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) in accordance with Public Law 109-461.  
Bid opening was held December 4, 2012 at 3:00 p.m. CST.  One (1) bid was received.  
FAR 14-404-1 (c)(6) states "Invitations may be cancelled and all bids rejected before award but after opening when, consistent with subparagraph (a) (1) of this section, the agency head determines in writing that (6) All other acceptable bids received are at unreasonable prices, or only one bid is received and the contracting officer cannot determine the reasonableness of the bid price. The bid is approximately 309% more than the IGE. Due to the lack of adequate competition and the difference between the bid price and the IGE, I am unable to determine price reasonableness of the sole bid.
Upon the basis of the aforementioned findings, cancellation of the subject solicitation is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS *NOT* A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE.    <br>  <br> *** CHANGE 10 May 13 - As a result of some unintended confusion over the submission date for the capability briefs and the fact that the response date is so close to the Memorial Day holiday; the response date for the capability briefs was changed to a hard due date of 3 Jun 13.  The below reference to 20 days after posting was deleted and changed to 3 Jun 13.  There are no other changes associated with this Sources Sought Notice.     <br>  <br> This sources sought is issued for two purposes:  (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community; and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of interested small business firms or teams for the recompetition of the Program Executive Office for Simulation Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contract, W900KK-09-D-0006.  The existing contract contains a period of performance of 5 years, (one-year base period and four one-year options to extend).  The current cumulative Task Order value is approximately $199 Mil through four years of execution.  Current SETA staffing consists of approximately 300 contracted employees (the current staffing size is meant to assist in sizing the effort and does not reflect a desire by the government to influence the potential contract solution).   <br>      <br>   The non-personal services include related activities in support of all aspects of simulation, training, and instrumentation systems.  The contract will provide for Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) to the PEO STRI and other U.S. Government agencies worldwide as well as state and local agencies.  The services will include related activities in support of all aspects of providing responsive integrated and interoperable infrastructure for Simulation, Training, Testing, and Instrumentation Solutions and Acquisition Services for the Warfighters and the Nation.  Support will be required for services for effective, efficient, and responsive full lifecycle management of efforts to include but not limited to: administrative support, vision statements and doctrine; development of architectures; program support e.g., acquisition and budget planning, business and financial programming and execution, modeling, simulation, simulator, training device, and instrumentation development, documentation, fielding and execution, system analysis and integration, integrated logistics support, strategic planning, contingency and mission support, program oversight, independent verification validation and test evaluation, prototype development, sustainment and operation, and analysis of emerging technologies, support; subject matter expert on military tactics, techniques, and procedures.  The primary places of performance are Orlando, FL; Fort Huachuca, AR and Huntsville, AL; however Field Service Representatives are located throughout the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside CONUS (OCONUS) locations.   <br>      <br>   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 with a small business size standard of $35.5 Mil for this acquisition.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be 100 percent set-aside for small business and will therefore contain FAR clause 52.219-14 (must be met by the prime contractor, not collective small business team members).  A final determination of the set aside status will be made after a thorough market research has been conducted to ascertain small business capabilities.  The Government anticipates the follow-on acquisition will result in a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) award with fixed-price labor categories and cost reimbursable travel and materials line items.  The resultant contract will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit the awardee from participating in any other PEO STRI contracts.  To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Government's interests, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractor's actual SETA performance.  In order to be considered for award, offerors must possess or be able to obtain a TOP SECRET facility security clearance.   <br>      <br>   The capability statements should focus on:  demonstration of financial stability, ability to retain existing staff and hire/acquire qualified personnel, ability to provide continuity of operations at the beginning and end of the contract, assurance that the small business firm will perform, at a minimum, 50% of the work, capability to perform realistic cost and schedule projections for complex technical and integration efforts, ability to manage multiple task orders at multiple locations, and demonstration of a management structure that allows for an integrated organization accountable for total performance responsibility.   <br>      <br>   In addition to the capability statements, please include some basic information regarding similar support your company is performing or has performed within the last three years and the method of that performance.  For example, please provide type of contract, method of execution, any actions taken to increase efficiency and reduce costs, etc.  Also provide information on what contract incentives or combination of incentives, if any, should be considered for the resultant contract and why.  Advise on what objectively measured evaluation criteria would be appropriate, especially for SETA support services.  Advise if incentives based on cost saving are appropriate in a SETA-service environment.   <br>      <br>   Capability statements are limited to ten (10) pages and are due no later than 3 Jun 13.  A cover letter must be provided with your ten (10) page submission and must include, at a minimum, identification of the proposed prime contractor, the type of small business (i.e., small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, 8(a), etc.) under which your Company plans to submit a proposal, and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions.  If proposing as a team, the capability statement must reflect the team and team approach.  Large business interests are not desired at this time.  The capability statements and cover letter must be submitted via email to keyanna.r.boone@us.army.mil and duane.stpeter@us.army.mil.  The subject line for email submission is:  SETA 2014 Recompete - Capability Statement.   <br>      <br>   This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, it does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized pursuant to FAR 5.2 on the Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPPS) website.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any synopsis or solicitation.   <br>      <br>   An Industry day will be announced in a future update to this announcement.  In addition, a date range will be established to allow for interested parties to set up one-on-one meetings with the requirements activity.  The one-on-one schedule will also be announced via an update to this posting.   <br>      <br>   Attached Documents:  DRAFT SETA PWS, OCI Clause, and initial Notice of Intent.    <br>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ); IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  <br>    <br>  1.0 DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future RFP will not be entertained.   <br>    <br>  2.0 SUBJECT: The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) is conducting market research to assess the commercial availability or technical maturity of technologies that are capable of satisfying the capability gap for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases (ID) in austere environments.  Moreover, the USAMRMC wishes to receive industry comment on both the commercial interest and the commercial viability of diagnostic devices capable of meeting our needs, inclusive of affordability given the projected Department of Defense (DoD) demand.  Attachment 1 describes the USAMRMC Target Product Profile (TPP) for ID diagnostic capabilities.  Of note is the Key Performance Parameter (KPP) of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance. Commensurate with this parameter, respondents should strongly consider associated development cost, post FDA-clearance costs, and overall commercial viability both globally and in the US market in order to determine if candidate products can be sustained in a way that is both profitable to the company and affordable by the DoD.    <br>    <br>  3.0 Background: In the absence of approved prophylactic drugs and vaccines, prevention and early diagnosis remain the best option to mitigate the impact of certain ID pathogens in US Service Members.  The USAMRMC has a need to develop and field (in a sustainable and affordable manner) forward-deployable, rapid, ID diagnostics that meet or exceed the specifications listed in Attachment 1 (see ATTACHMENT).  Recently, the USAMRMC prioritized diseases and pathogens of interest for rapid diagnostic devices (see Table 1 in ATTACHMENT).   This table, although not comprehensive, lists those IDs for which diagnostics are needed based on military end-user desirability and potential impact.  Additionally, Table 1 lists the anticipated DoD annual purchase quantities .  Note: Table 1 depicts the diseases and pathogens that are the USAMRMC's top priorities.  However, the USAMRMC also has interest in developing other ID diagnostic capabilities that are not included in the table.  Procurement quantities are subject to change and industry should comment on the feasibility of sustaining the capability on the US market given the procurement quantity listed.    <br>    <br>  Prior to determining the acquisition strategy, the USAMRMC must assess the commercial market for availability and maturity of commercially developed ID diagnostic candidates that are both rapid and forward-deployable (henceforth referred to as  quote mark candidates quote mark ) and gauge industry interest in developing these candidates for the US market.  Moreover, the USAMRMC must ensure that a sufficient US market and industry interest (in that market) exists to warrant investment in development and (more importantly) sustainment of these candidates (following FDA-clearance) at quantities and cost that are sustainable in the marketplace and affordable to the USAMRMC.   <br>    <br>  Specifically, the USAMRMC is interested in determining the following:  <br>  A. candidate diagnostic products, either in the development pipeline or currently marketed in the US or in foreign markets, that  can be used to diagnose the USAMRMC ID Pathogen Priorities shown in Table 1.    <br>  B. the current status of each candidate  <br>  C. how specifications of each candidate compare with the USAMRMC threshold/objective specifications (Attachment 1 in Attachment)  <br>  D. why or why not pursuit of  FDA clearance and the US marketing is or is not being currently considered  <br>  E. the support interested industry sources will require from the DoD (technical and scientific expertise, clinical sites, research and development financial support, procurement needs (projected US market cost, projected sustainment quantity), etc.)   <br>    <br>  In addition, the USAMRMC wishes to obtain industry feedback on strategies by which candidate assays can be combined, kitted, or otherwise optimized such that logistical burden can be minimized and greater affordability can be achieved in the long term.  For example: Creatively packaging individual assay capabilities together may promote cost savings and affordability.   Please share perspectives on different strategies that the MRMC may want to consider.   <br>    <br>  Table 1: See Attachment for Table 1  <br>    <br>  Ultimately, in order for the USAMRMC to be able to field a candidate, it must meet or exceed the specifications listed in Attachement 1: FDA-cleared, no greater than moderate complexity, usable in austere environments (without the requirement for electricity or for ancillary laboratory equipment not provided with the diagnostic test), relatively small and lightweight, fielded with external controls, and provide results rapidly.  Please refer to Attachment 1 for a complete list of specifications.  It is preferred that the candidates will be usable by medical personnel (such as a medic or physician assistant) without specialized medical laboratory technician training (i.e., the test is CLIA-waived or capable of being CLIA-waived). In addition to technical performance and affordability, the USAMRMC is also interested in several non-technical issues and strategic concerns. Ultimately, the USAMRMC wishes to obtain industry feedback in order to assess the viability and affordability of developing and maintaining a supply of ID diagnostic capabilities that meet specifications.  Respondents should address these items as explained in Section 4.0.   <br>    <br>  4.0 Response Instructions:  <br>    <br>  Respondents should address the following in their submission:  <br>  A. Name and address of company  <br>  B. Names and contact information of key company personnel  <br>    <br>  Note: For items a through l, please focus on those candidates that correspond with ID pathogen priorities listed in Table 1and provide responses for each candidate proposed.   <br>    <br>  C. Description of  each ID diagnostic candidate currently in development that is (or will be) capable of meeting or exceeding the specifications in Attachment 1 to include:   <br>  a. Name of proposed candidate(s)  <br>  b. Intended use or proposed intended use  <br>  c. Technical Description: A brief technical description explaining the technology utilized and manufacturing methods used and anticipated (or proven) sensitivity and specificity. Please also include information about the ability of the technology to multiplex (e.g. detect both pathogen Ag and human Ig; as applicable).  <br>  d. Description of Packaging/Kit: Either current or proposed  <br>  e. Ancillary Equipment/Consumables: Description of any equipment and consumables required to utilize the assay kit; indicating if each item is included with the kit (or not).  <br>  f. Package Insert (if available)   <br>  g. Candidate Maturity: Please describe the clearance status of the candidate to include (as applicable) FDA-clearance status and/or any clearance/obtained marketing permits for use in foreign countries. If not yet FDA-cleared, please specify an estimated time frame for achieving FDA clearance.   <br>  h. Projected selling price range per assay (please specify ranges for both US and foreign markets).  It will be assumed that the US market price range will reflect the selling price to the DoD. Costs for the US market should be inclusive of external controls.  <br>  i. Projected US and foreign market sales  <br>  j. Projected annual US market sales volume (# of assays) needed to sustain the assay in the US market, at the price range described in item h.  <br>  k. Minimum batch/production run size (# of assays / batch)  <br>  l. Willingness to pursue FDA clearance and the US market  <br>    <br>  D. Narrative:  Please describe the barriers to market entry as you see them and any suggestions on how the DoD can help to make rapid diagnostic development more sustainable. To that end, explain and/or answer the following:   <br>  a. Willingness/interest in co-developing ID diagnostic candidates with the DoD   <br>  b. General capabilities and limitations of your company that may require assistance from the USAMRMC  <br>  c. Willingness and ability to serve as the regulatory sponsor (510(k) holder)   <br>  d. Description/explanation of availability and/or development of external positive controls, which is a requirement for fielding within the military.   <br>  e. Feasibility of and willingness to pursue CLIA-waived status (in general) of candidates that have the potential to meet Attachment 1 specifications.  Comment on whether CLIA-waived devices are within your strategic plans. Why or why not?  <br>  f. Please comment on the overall market and sales with emphasis on US market and sustaining that market.  Include commentary on continuing to market such candidates in the US both with and without DOD demand. Specifically, is the capability sustainable in the US market at the DoD demand levels depicted in Table 1?  If not, what is a more realistic DoD demand that the USAMRMC should consider?    <br>  g. Please describe (in general) any concerns you may have involving the sustainability of ID diagnostic products that meet or exceed USAMRMC specifications given the size of both US and foreign markets, and your anticipated profit margins.  Expand on issues that you think the USAMRMC should consider in further considering development and acquisition strategy in terms of the potential to decrease unit cost and achieve better overall sustainability.    <br>  h. Please describe any developmental or commercial partnerships and/or relationships that would facilitate development and fielding/supply to the US market.    <br>    <br>  5.0 CONTACT INFORMATION: Any and all questions related to this RFI shall be directed to Shannyn Scassero at shannyn.scassero.civ@mail.mil no later than 20 MAY 13, 12:00 PM ET.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2). <br>  <br> FDA approved countermeasure that will increase the likelihood that a Warfighter will maintain operational effectiveness following nerve agent exposure, specifically a drug or biologic intended for use prior to an exposure to nerve agent, i.e., a prophylactic countermeasure.  It is anticipated that the countermeasure, when administered prior to nerve agent exposure, shall decrease incapacitation and death associated with nerve agent poisoning.  Specifically, when administered prior to nerve agent exposure, the countermeasure should prevent injury by binding and sequestering or degrading nerve agent in the circulatory system before it can reach the nervous system.

<DESC>The goal of the broader Partnership for Growth (PFG) bilateral engagement is to shift the Philippines from a low growth path to a higher, sustained and more inclusive growth on par with other high-performing emerging economies.  The TRADE Project is intended to contribute to higher growth by supporting reform measures to advance the country's commitments under the Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint, which outlines concrete targets for establishing a single market and production base in the ASEAN region by 2015 and improve Philippine readiness to join other free trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement.
<p>TRADE will contribute to Development Objective (DO) 1 of USAID's Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) of "broad based and inclusive growth accelerated and sustained". Specifically, TRADE will address Intermediate Result (IR) 1.1 of DO No. 1 "trade and investment increased" and Sub-IR 1.1.1 "Economic Competitiveness Enhanced".</p>
