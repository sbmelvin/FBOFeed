<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the <strong>Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP)</strong> in October.   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its <strong>Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP)</strong>, located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The <strong>AAAP </strong>will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the <strong>AAAP </strong>website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the <strong>AAAP </strong>homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the <strong>AAAP </strong>website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />The Open Period for October* is <strong>October 1, 2016 to October 20, 2016, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST</strong>.  The <strong>AAAP </strong>will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the <strong>AAAP </strong>website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the <strong>AAAP </strong>program through the remainder of FY 2017 or until it is replaced.
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2016, the <strong>AAAP </strong>application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2017 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY17 <strong>AAAP</strong> RLP Package and  each page within the <strong>AAAP </strong>Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the <strong>AAAP</strong>. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP # 17-Reg1 and must be located within Region 1 (New England).</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.</p>

<AWARDEE>INSTITUTE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, INC.;9201 W BROADWAY AVE STE 600;MINNEAPOLIS;MN;55445
<DESC>OBJECTIVES:
The purpose of this contract is to procure services for collecting and analyzing water samples for Legionella in accordance with VHA Directive 1061, "PREVENTION OF HEALTHCARE-ASSOCIATED LEGIONELLA DISEASE AND SCALD INJURY FROM POTABLE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS" and for collecting and analyzing water samples to verify compliance with "Infection Control Standards for VA Dental Clinics," 21 October 2013, and EPA Safe Drinking Water Act regulations in Dental Offices in the Fargo VA Health Care System. A summary of expected sample collection and analysis activities is attached as Attachment A.   VHA Directive 1061 is attached as Attachment B. "Infection Control Standards for VA Dental Clinics" is attached as Attachment C. 

SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES:

1.	Legionella Sampling Requirements: 

a.	General Procedures for Legionella Sampling: 

The contractor shall furnish all personnel, supervision, equipment, supplies, facilities, certifications, transportation, and resources necessary to perform Legionella water testing. The contractor must furnish all sample collection equipment. Containers must be sterile, appropriate for the analysis, properly preserved, and promptly transported to the laboratory under strict chain of custody procedures. 

The contractor shall collect and analyze water samples from distal points (sinks and showers) and ice or water from ice machines on Fargo VA Health Care System campuses included in the contract.  Specific distal point locations for sampling will be determined by the COR and/or the Health Care System Point of Contact. The numbers and types of samples to be collected and analyzed are specified in Attachment D.

Testing of the building's hot and cold water distribution system(s) for L. pneumophila must be performed quarterly (once per Federal Fiscal Year quarter, plus or minus 10 calendar days from the date of the last performance of regular quarterly service). Extensions may be granted for unforeseen conditions and for other factors outside of the contractor's control. 

Water samples must be taken from outlets on the hot water distribution system and outlets on the cold water distribution system from each building for each quarterly testing cycle.  NOTE: "Outlets" are the points in the water distribution system where the end user comes in contact with the water (e.g., faucet, showers, and ice machines).  Water samples will be taken at first "draw" to catch the water that comes out immediately from the outlet and will be at least 250 ml for routine samples.  
  
At the time each water sample is taken, test (measure) and document the following for each sample: water temperature after it reaches a stable temperature, level of residual biocide (performing the proper testing for the site based on type of biocide), and pH.  This documentation needs to be provided with the analysis results. 

Non-routine sampling (outside of the quarterly sampling) may be conducted as needed.  The Health Care System is allowed non-routine samples numbering up to 10% of the total samples taken from the health care system annually.  If sampling over this amount is needed by the health care system, the contractor will provide a fixed price for the sampling equipment and analysis and for the collection of samples for the health care system.  The cost of this sampling will be added to the overall price of the contract.   

For non-routine sampling, the contractor must be able to sample within 24 hours of being notified of the need to sample. Samples of at least 1000 ml may be required. Water samples will be taken at first "draw" to catch the water that comes out immediately from the outlet.  Swab sampling may be conducted along with the water sampling for non-routine sampling. Swab sampling will be done in accordance with VHA direction and in accordance with direction from the laboratory where the samples will be analyzed. 

The specific sampling location and type of sample (e.g. hot water or cold water) will be specified by COR and/or Health Care System Point of Contact. Specific distal points sampled will vary per quarter, so communication with the Health Care System Point of Contact will be required before the round of sampling each quarter or before non-routine sampling in order to ensure that the contractor knows the locations of sampling. The locations of buildings included in the sampling are attached at Attachment D.  This list also includes the Health Care System Points of Contact information.

b.	Sample Collection, Storage, and Transferring of Analysis: 

Samples will be collected, stored, and transferred as directed by the COR or by the laboratory. For routine sampling, water samples need to be at 250 ml.  For non-routine sampling, water samples of at least 1000 ml may be required. Water samples will be taken at first "draw" to catch the water that comes out immediately from the outlet.  Each water sample will be collected in a sterile, unused, HDPE or HDPP plastic leak-proof container provided by the testing laboratory. The following parameters will be measured and logged with each water sample is collected: water temperature upon reaching a stable temperature, level of residual biocide, and pH. Samples will be stored and transferred for analysis in a manner that will maintain the integrity of the samples. Samples will be secured to prevent cross-contamination. Samples need to arrive at the testing laboratory within the time frame defined by the ELITE laboratory.   


c.	Sample Analysis and Reporting:

The testing laboratory processing the water samples for Legionella must be certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Environmental Legionella Isolation Techniques Evaluation (ELITE) program as proficient at performing the culture of Legionella from environmental samples. The limit of detection must be < = 1 CFU/ml. The full 250 ml volume of potable water must be concentrated for routine quarterly testing.  The full 1000 ml volume of potable water must be concentrated for non-routine testing.  The testing laboratory must retain samples that test positive for Legionella for 30 calendar days and must release them to the healthcare system if requested.  Information about ELITE certified laboratories can be found at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/elite/Public/MemberList.aspx. The testing laboratory must also be able to determine if the Legionella detected in environmental samples is the species Legionella pneumophila and whether it is serogroup 1.  Quantify L. pneumophila and identify the presence or absence of other Legionella species. NOTE: rapid testing method, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) are not permitted.
 
In addition to the CDC ELITE certification, the laboratory must have environmental microbiology accreditation by a nationally recognized accrediting body, such as EMLAP, NELAP, etc. Proof of certification must be provided before acceptance of contract.  

Provide all sample analysis reports via e-mail to COR and Health Care System Point of Contact. Notification of any positive sampling results will be made within two working days of making this determination. Analytical reports shall include a signed copy of the chain of custody, identification of sampling locations and conditions, including the specific outlet temperature of water at the time the sample was collected, pH, biocide residual levels, method detection limits, and a description of test methodology. Sample reports need to be provided in a format that can be copied into the VHA Legionella sampling results reporting form. Sample analysis reports must be provided within 15 calendar days of the lab receiving the samples. If the 15th day falls on a weekend of federally observed holiday, the reports shall be provided no later than the next normal business day.

The testing laboratory shall have qualified technical support staff for consultation relative to water sample collection, testing, and interpretation of results. 


2.	Procedures for Sampling for Safe Drinking Water Compliance for Dental Waterlines:

a. General Requirements and Procedures for Sampling of Dental Waterlines:

Sampling equipment and lab analysis will be provided to the Dental Clinic for testing the waterlines for compliance with the EPA Safe Drinking Water Act standard for potable water and the "Infection Control Standards for VA Dental Clinic," dated 21, October 2013.  Sampling analysis will be for total colony forming units (cfu) of heterotrophic water bacteria per milliliter of water. 

The Contractor will furnish sterile bottles that are appropriate for the analysis, properly preserved, and promptly transported to the Dental Clinic. The Contractor will furnish appropriate shipping containers for the transportation of samples to the laboratory. The bottles will be marked to indicate what facility they are supplied to and a unique identifying number for that facility and for the sample. Comprehensive instructions on how samples will be collected, preserved, and transported to the laboratory for analysis will be provided to each facility covered under the contract. The laboratory will follow strict chain of custody procedures upon the receipt of the samples from the facility.

Sampling is required on a quarterly basis for each waterline in the Dental Clinic. 51 quarterly samples will be taken. The Point of Contact is Miranda Begg, 701-232-3241 ext. 3371, and the address is 2101 Elm Street, Fargo, North Dakota, 58102.

Non-routine sampling (outside of the quarterly sampling) may be conducted as needed.  The health care system is allowed non-routine samples numbering up to 10% of the total samples taken annually. If sampling over this amount is needed by the healthcare system, the contractor will provide a fixed price for the sampling equipment and analysis. The cost of this sampling will be added to the overall price of the contract.  For non-routine sampling, sampling bottles and supplies must be provided to the requesting Dental Clinic within 2 business days of being notified of the need to sample. If any sample results indicate that a level of heterotrophic water bacteria is over 500 cfu/ml, the contractor will automatically send sampling supplies within 1 business day.   

The laboratory that processes the water samples will be certified by the Environmental Protection Agency or a State environmental protection agency to perform environmental sampling. Proof of certification must be provided before acceptance of contract.  

The laboratory will utilize the Standard Spread Plate Method 9215C using R2A agar.  Sampling results will report the number of colony forming units of heterotrophic water bacteria per milliliter of water (cfu/ml), readings of less than 10 or greater than 500 may be recorded as <10 cfu/ml or > 500 cfu/ml. 

Provide all sample analysis reports via e-mail to the COR and the Health Care System Point of Contact within 10 calendar days of receiving the sample. If the 10th day falls on a weekend of federally observed holiday, the reports shall be provided no later than the next normal business day. Notification of any positive sampling results will be made within two work days of making this determination. Analytical reports shall include a signed copy of the chain of custody, identification of sampling locations, method detection limits, and a description of test methodology. 

The testing laboratory shall have qualified technical support staff for consultation relative to water sample collection, testing, and interpretation of results.
