<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in relation to the support of all of NATO's business needs through a modernized IT Infrastructure that is more effective and less costly than that which is in place today. <br /><br />Potential U.S. prime contractors must be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government will nominate to the bidders list only those firms that 1) have been approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 2) hold a current DOD facility security clearance at the level of SECRET or higher.
<p>In addition, for performance of the contract, contractor personnel working on NATO sites will be required to hold a NATO SECRET personnel security clearance. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NCIA the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-13703-ITM and all correspondence concering the IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>OVERVIEW<br /><br />The ITM project is intended to: 1) enable NATO Enterprise Users to continue to conduct their operational business, via the NCIA provision of the required level of end user services, which are underpinned by infrastructure services and 2)&nbsp;provide modern effective and cost-efficient Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) that:</p>
<p>a. Supports IT services up to the NATO RESTRICTED (NR) level on the Protected Business Network (PBN) domain;<br />b. Supports IT services up to the NATO SECRET (NS) level on the Operational Network (ON) domain;<br />c. Delivers increased operational flexibility and agility;<br />d. Provides increased service availability and resiliency that meets user needs;<br />e. Delivers improvements to the CIS security posture;<br />f. Is able to support applications to meet operational user needs and service levels;<br />g. Increases efficiency in service delivery and support, yielding reduced total cost of ownership and reduced provisioning times throughout the service lifecycle; <br />h. Enables enterprise level reporting to a common set of performance indicators and metrics;<br />i. Realises the benefits of "Green IT";<br />j. Enables enterprise level governance and architecture<br />k. Provides sustainable services.</p>
<p>A Summary of Requirements is set forth in the attachment. These requirements are being refined and detailed as part of the preparation of the ITM proposed contract.</p>
<p>Please note that prospective prime contractors that are nominated to the bidders list will be invited to participate in a pre-solicitation ITM industry day event that is planned to be held in the first quarter of 2014. The aim of the event will be to provide background details on the ITM project and how it is planned to be delivered. It will also help to facilitate industrial teaming in order to provide the Best Value solution to NATO. Depending on the level of interest, a suitable venue for the event will be identified and details and formal invitations will be promulgated. Further details of how to participate will be published on the NCIA Bulletin Board.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application): 13 February 2014<br /><br />- IFB planned to be issued in Q1 2014</p>
<p>- Bid Closing planned for Q2 2014</p>
<p>- Contract Award anticipated in Q1 2015</p>

Select NNH14ZOA001N-14ECF-B1 <p> STMDs Space Technology Research Grants Program seeks proposals from accredited U.S. universities on behalf of faculty members beginning their independent careers. This Appendix is focused on supporting outstanding faculty researchers early in their careers as they conduct space technology research of high priority to NASAs Mission Directorates. NASA is seeking proposals that plan to pursue innovative, early-stage space technology research in the topic areas specifically described in the Appendix. <P> Our Nations universities couple fundamental research with education, encouraging a culture of innovation based on the discovery of knowledge. Universities are, therefore, ideally positioned to both conduct fundamental space technology research and diffuse newly-found knowledge into society at large through graduate students and industrial, government, and other partnerships. STMD investments in space technology research at U.S. universities will promote the continued leadership of our universities as an international symbol of the country's scientific innovation, engineering creativity, and technological skill. <P> Only accredited U.S. universities are eligible to submit proposals on behalf of their outstanding new faculty members who intend to develop academic careers related to space technology. The proposed research project must be led by a single, eligible Principal Investigator (PI). The PI must be a recent Ph.D. recipient, defined as having graduated on or after January 1, 2007. The PI must be an untenured Assistant Professor on the tenure track at the sponsoring U.S. university at the time of award. The PI must be a U.S. citizen or have lawful status of permanent residency (i.e., holder of a U.S. Permanent Resident Card, also referred to as a Green Card). The PI may not be a current or former recipient of a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE). The PI must be the primary researcher on the effort. Co-Investigators are not permitted. Collaborators are permitted. <P> A PI may submit only one proposal in response to this Appendix.  There is no limit on the number of proposals which may be submitted by an accredited U.S. university. <P> NASA encourages submission of ECF proposals on behalf of early career faculty members at all institutions and especially encourages proposals submitted on behalf of women, members of underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities. <P> The financial and programmatic support for ECF comes from the Space Technology Research Grants Program within the Space Technology Mission Directorate. Awards are planned to start in fall 2014. NASA plans to make approximately 5 awards as a result of this ECF Appendix, subject to the receipt of meritorious proposals. The actual number of awards will depend on the quality of the proposals received; NASA reserves the right to make no awards under this Appendix. <P> All proposals must be submitted electronically through NSPIRES or through Grants.gov (www.grants.gov) by an authorized organizational representative. Notices of Intent (not mandatory) are requested by February 14, 2014. Proposals are due on or before March 14, 2014. Detailed submission instructions are provided in the SpaceTech-REDDI-2014 NRA. Potential proposers and their proposing organizations are urged to familiarize themselves with the submission system(s), ensure they are registered in NSPIRES, and submit the required proposal materials well in advance of the deadline. <P> Technical and programmatic comments and questions may be addressed by e-mail to the Space Technology Research Grants Program Executive, Claudia Meyer, at hq-ecf-call@mail.nasa.gov. Procurement questions may be addressed by e-mail to the procurement point of contact, Jonathon Wingerberg, at hq-ecf-call@mail.nasa.gov. Responses to inquiries will be answered by e-mail and may also be included in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document located on the NSPIRES page associated with the Appendix; anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved. <p>

SCOPE OF WORK
Bedford VA Medical Center Theater, Ceiling Replacement Project
Scaffold Rental



Project 1376 involves the removal of an existing lath and plaster ceiling in the theater of the Bedford VA Medical Center, 200 Springs Rd., Bedford, MA.  Ceiling will be removed to the existing bar joists, new, light gage steel framing will be installed, and new, sound-attenuating drywall will be installed, floated, and finished conventionally.  To provide access for the removal and replacement of the ceiling, a temporary scaffold is required which will reach to the work area and will accommodate the sloping floor of the theater.  To allow room to conduct the work the scaffold will span the width of the room, but only one-third the length.  This will necessitate dismantle, shifting, and reinstallation of the scaffold two additional times after the initial set-up.  Qualified vendor shall supply to the Veterans Construction Team the following:

1.	Monthly rental, delivery to site and installation of modular scaffold system, approximately 33' long by 33' wide with a work platform 6' below the existing ceiling, including all necessary hardware and accessories.  Ceiling height is approximately 26' at highest point.  Floor is sloping.

2.	Installation of access ladders to provide access to work platform.


3.	Dismantling, relocation, and reassembly of the entire scaffold system a total of two additional times after initial installation.  Times for such service shall be coordinated by representative of Veterans Construction Team with vendor.  Delivery of service shall be provided by vendor within five business days of contact.

4.	Dismantling and removal from site of scaffold system and all appurtenances thereof.


Successful bidder shall be capable of providing services listed above, in quantities specified in Request for Quotation (RFQ), within thirty (30) days of date of contract award.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS announcement to be used for preliminary market research purposes only.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  The type of solicitation issued in the future will depend upon the responses to this sources sought synopsis.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests. <br>  <br> The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Small Business community to compete and perform a Service Contract.  <br>   <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) is issuing this request for information (RFI) announcement as part of a market survey for Technical and Research & Development Services for Environmental Risk Assessment. <br>  <br>  This Performance Work Statement (PWS) describes the technical and research and development (R & D) services required by Environmental Risk Assessment Branch (ERAB) involved in the area of environmental risk assessment processes. <br>  <br> The US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Environmental Laboratory (EL), Environmental Risk Assessment Branch (ERAB) conducts research on the bioavailability and effects of chemical contaminants on endpoint organisms in the environment. Scientists utilize an array of bioassay techniques to assess contaminant effects at the biochemical, cellular, individual, community, and population level and to develop models for contaminant uptake and pathways in biological systems. Developed models and effects assessments are incorporated into risk and hazard assessment protocols for use in contaminant cleanup and remediation projects and regulatory testing. The essential linkage is between the fraction of contaminant actually available for uptake by the organism and the level of response that results. Biota of primary interest are plants, invertebrates and fish intimately in contact with sediments, invertebrates, and plants in their natural habitats. The branch has wide experience in exposure and effects assessment as well as risk management, decision analytics, and risk communication. <br>  <br> The overall objective of this procurement is to obtain a technical contractor to execute research tasks and provide deliverables to the Government, as defined in the applicable task orders, for both the Civil Works Direct/Reimbursable and Military Direct/Reimbursable work areas. <br>  <br> The contract will include tasks for the Research and Development (R&D) being executed by the ERAB both at Vicksburg, MS, and Concord, MA (USACE New England), as well as remote field sites as applicable. CORs will be appointed to oversee tasks at all locations.  The technical contract needed is aimed at satisfying the Army and DoD requirements by containing specific tasks which include a multi-disciplinary approach to basic and applied environmental research to study the effects of environmental contaminants for civil works, military projects, and environmental decision analysis.  Training may be required to allow for laboratory safety, handling of radioactive materials, handling of hazardous materials, animal care and use, first aid and CPR and biannual refreshers, basic bioinformatics and statistics, decision and risk analytics, RNA/DNA sequencing applications, scientific instrumentations, protocols, and applications.  <br>  <br> Security Clearance:  The contractor may be asked to possess and maintain a Department of Defense (DoD) Classified Security Clearance.  If required, the contractor personnel must be a U.S. citizen and capable of obtaining and maintaining appropriate security clearances up to the SECRET level.  If a SECRET level security clearance is required for a task order, it will be specified on the task order.

The choice of lighting is crucial. Inspectors must examine kernels of grain which are judged based the intensity of color. If you have some bulbs of a different lumen, color index, and color temperature it can cause inspectors to misjudge the kernels. <br /><br />These H &amp; H bulbs have a unique color index and lumens not found in any other bulbs and are the only bulbs used by inspectors because they have been proven to produce the best results. The use of any other brand of bulbs other than H &amp; H would also require replacement of all the bulbs when only one is extinguished which would be quite costly and unnecessary.

If an e-mail response is not received by 2:00 PM EST on January 27, 2014, which clearly demonstrates the offeror's ability to meet the requirements, the Government intends to negotiate a sole source award to Beyond Trust Software, Inc. Interested parties are instructed to submit responses electronically to LaTrina.D.Brown@irs.gov. E-mail responses are limited to 5MB of memory and the sender is responsible for successful transmission of any/all e-mails sent in response to this notice.
<p>Brand Name Justification:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) - One responsible source; or brand name specification. This requirement is being procured under the above mentioned authority as a result of the manufacturer deeming the product/services as proprietary (thus there are no other manufacturers). This product/services is also considered brand name as there are no other versions of this product/service. The Department of Treasury has been using this product/service for a number of years.</p>
<p>This is a follow on requirement for annual maintenance support for its Retina Scan Software.&nbsp; Retina Scan is software utilized to holistically scan the EBS infrastructure and identify security issues, risks and/or vulnerabilities. Annual product maintenance support is needed for the licenses used to support this security software.</p>
<p>Retina provides unique visibility across the entire IT infrastructure from one place in real time.&nbsp; Retina provides a unique ability to scan resources across the defined network and identify security issues/problems and investigate resolutions in minutes instead of hours or days to deliver compliance. <br />Additionally EBS has already invested in the software package for Retina Scan and will now only need software maintenance as a product.</p>
<p>It would be less efficient and more costly and timely to use a product/service other than the brand name listed above. It is in the best interest of the Government to maintain this brand name product/service.</p>

<p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER SPRPA1-11-G-001Y</p>
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane has a requirement for spare parts in support of the MH-60 Helicopter Platform. The Government intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, 6900 Main Street, Stratford, CT 06614. No formal solicitation will be issued. The procurement will include: 11 Nose Mount Fairings (P/N: 96207-01101-103), 11 Turret Nose Mounts (P/N 70200-81003-047), 11 HCU Jumper (P/N 96552-11112-041), 11 Molded Cables (P/N 96550-01821-103) and 11 Molded Cables (P/N 96550-01821-104). These components are proprietary to Sikorsky. Procurement under the contract will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements through a 5-year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) SPRPA1-11-G-001Y. NSWC Crane previously issued a BOA order (FC01) for these parts in September 2011. This additional order (FC02) will satisfy increased mission requirements. Inspection will be made by DCMA at Origin, Acceptance will be at Destination. The basis for restricting competition are the proprietary rights of Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and the duplicative costs to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Government(s) requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The point of contact for this action is Ms. Diane Bright, telephone 812-854-2938, fax 812-854-5095, e-mail diane.bright@navy.mil (preferred method).</p>

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT for
Lippincott's Nursing Solutions

This is not a request for proposal or a request for quote.  There is no solicitation document available.  This is a notice of intent of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at The James A. Haley Veterans Hospital, 13000 Bruce B. Downs Blvd, Tampa, Florida to negotiate a sole source contract with Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. (WKH), Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (LWW) for Online access to Lippincott's Nursing Procedures and Skills.  This is a logical follow-on to a prior subscription for nursing access to Lippincott's Nursing Solutions and Training at the Tampa VA. Alternant subscriptions will disrupt the ongoing training and certification program for the intended audience at this facility.  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Government to reacquire this subscription through WKH to ensure consistent terms and conditions in licensing and provide continuity of audience training and certification.  The price is considered fair and reasonable.  The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1).  This procurement is being conducted using FAR Part 12 procedures.  Correspondence may be forwarded to James L. Jones, Contract Specialist at james.jones30@va.gov.

<p>The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>52.209-1 -- Qualification Requirements.<br />As prescribed in 9.206-2, insert the following clause:</p>
<p>Qualification Requirements (Feb 1995)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Qualification requirement," as used in this clause, means a Government requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed before award.</p>
<p>(b) One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification.</p>
<p>(Name) _Jeffrey Brady_______</p>
<p>(Email Address) _jeffrey.brady@us.af.mil_____</p>

<p>Item Name __________________________________</p>
<p>Service Identification __________________________</p>
<p>Test Number ______________________________ (to the extent known)</p>
<p>(d) Even though a product or service subject to a qualification requirement is not itself an end item under this contract, the product, manufacturer, or source must nevertheless be qualified at the time of award of this contract. This is necessary whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's best interests.</p>
<p>(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract. Unless determined to be in the Government's interest, award of this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit evidence of qualification.</p>
<p>(f) Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a previously qualified product or service was manufactured or performed requires reevaluation of the qualification. Similarly, any change in location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source requires reevaluation of the qualification. The reevaluation must be accomplished before the date of award.</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). <br />(2) Certification.</p>

<DESC>The United States Postal Service (USPS) is prequalifying contractors for parking improvement projects in Ohio. <br /><br />Concurrently, The USPS plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a parking lot improvement at the Cincinnati P&amp;DC located at 1591 Dalton Avenue, Cincinnati OH, 45234. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings. The estimated cost of the project is between $1,800,000 and $2,800,000 with construction completion within 365 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br /><br />There are two (2) possible outcomes to this solicitation:<br /><br />1. Contractors who are determined by the Evaluation Team to be highly qualified for these types of projects in the State of Ohio will have their Cincinnati P&amp;DC proposals opened and evaluated in accordance with Section 2 requirements. Contractors will also be added to a list of prequalified contractors for potential future work in that state.
<p>2. Contractors who are not considered highly qualified by the Evaluation Team to perform this type of work for the US Postal Service in Ohio. Any Cincinnati P&amp;DC proposals submitted will not be opened.</p>
<p>NOTE: Prequalification does not imply or guarantee that Contractor(s) will receive an invitation to provide proposals for work or do any work for the US Postal Service in the future.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br /><br />(1) Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State of Ohio, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained.</p>
<p>(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.</p>
<p>(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.</p>
<p>(5) Company must submit information for a minimum of three and a maximum of five comparable projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as parking/paving projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $500,000 or more.<br />The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most qualified contractors will be considered. Price will be considered more important than the other evaluation factors contained in the Management Plan for individual security projects. However, the Postal Service will select the Offeror that provides the best value to the Postal Service.</p>
<p>Prequalified contractors will be placed on a list for inclusion in future solicitations in this area with similar scopes of work. There is no guarantee that a specific number of solicitations will be issued to these prequalified contractors.<br /><br />A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON 1-30-2014, AT 10:00 A.M. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br /><br />The SOLICITATION PACKAGE is attached to this posting.<br /><br />QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Michael Douglass, Purchasing &amp; Supply Management Specialist at michael.j.douglass@usps.gov.

Upon award, the name of the successful offeror and the amount of the contract will be released as public information. The names of offerors and the amount of their offers will not be released as public information. This information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, Exception 4.</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.14; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

No. 112-74), Division E, as amended and/or subsequently enacted, regarding corporate felony convictions and corporate federal tax delinquencies. Accordingly, by accepting this award the contractor acknowledges that it -</p>
<p>(1) does not have a tax delinquency, meaning that it is not subject to any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability, and</p>
<p>(2) has not been convicted (or had an officer or agent acting on its behalf convicted) of a felony criminal violation under any Federal law within 24 months preceding the award, unless a suspending and debarring official of the United States Department of Agriculture has considered suspension or debarment of the awardee, or such officer or agent, based on these convictions and/or tax delinquencies and determined that suspension or debarment is not necessary to protect the interests of the Government.</p>
<p>(b) If the awardee fails to comply with these provisions, the Forest Service may terminate this contract for default and may recover any funds the awardee has received in violation of sections 433 or 434, amended and/or subsequently enacted.</p>
<p>FAR 52.232-99 Providing Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors (DEVIATION) (AUG 2012)</p>

<p>(b) Include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns.</p>

The Contractor shall also be responsible for all materials delivered and work performed until completion and acceptance of the entire work, except for any completed unit of work which may have been accepted under the contract.</p>
<p>FAR 52.237-1 Site Visit (APR 1984)</p>
<p>Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.</p>

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Phillip.A.Will@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 28JAN14 0930 Pacific Time.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK<br />POSITION DESCRIPTION<br />BACKGROUND<br />The U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is an independent Federal agency which manages the U.S. Government's foreign assistance program, providing assistance for developing countries around the world in the areas of economic growth and trade, agriculture and the environment, education and training, democracy and governance, reconstruction and stabilization, global health, global partnerships and humanitarian assistance.<br />This is a Personal Services Contract (PSC) position to support the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), an office within USAID. The candidate will provide support to the OTI by working in the Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) which oversees the solicitation, selection, award and administration of contracts, grants and cooperative agreements in support of the OTI's portfolio objectives. Procurement actions may involve the private or the public sectors, international organizations, non-government and private voluntary organizations, educational institutions, and host country organizations (both private and public sector).<br />The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.<br />Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.<br />To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.<br />OBJECTIVE<br />The purpose of this solicitation is to hire a Contract Specialist who will assist the Contracting Officer.<br />Solicitation for a USPSC OAA Contract Specialist<br />SOL-OAA-14-000005<br />5 | P a g e<br />9.

When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).<br />(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:<br />(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;<br />(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and<br />(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.<br />(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible<br />Solicitation for a USPSC OAA Contract Specialist<br />SOL-OAA-14-000005<br />16 | P a g e<br />following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.<br />(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.<br />(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.<br />(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.<br />(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />Solicitation for a USPSC OAA Contract Specialist<br />SOL-OAA-14-000005<br />17 | P a g e<br />ATTACHMENT 2<br />FAR 52.222-50 COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (FEB 2009).<br />(a) Definitions.

<p>FAR Provision 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999):</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection technique. Evaluation may be made with or without discussions with the Offeror(s). The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on an acceptable/unacceptable basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made based on the evaluation criteria listed in the attached evaluation criteria document and the PWS. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or a result of discussions will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following two (2) factors (See REVISED&nbsp;Attachment #3 - Evaluation Factors &amp; Subfactors):</p>
<p>Factor 1. Technical Capability<br />Factor 2. Price</p>
<p>Part I: Technical Capability (Do not exceed 20 pages. This includes the cover page, cover letter, and table of contents).</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability</p>
<p>Technical Capability Proposals will be given a rating of Acceptable or Unacceptable. A technically acceptable proposal shall have a sound technical approach that meets all Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements.</p>
<p>Determination Definition<br />ACCEPTABLE: ALL of the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal. The Offeror's proposal meets the performance and technical capability requirements defined in the PWS.<br /><br />UNACCEPTABLE: Not all of the minimum acceptable criteria are met by the proposal. An unacceptable proposal contains one or more deficiencies. The proposal fails to meet specified minimum performance and technical capability requirements defined in the PWS.</p>
<p><br />Proposal shall address the following subfactors as detailed in REVISED-Attachment #3:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1: Training Requirements<br />Subfactor 2: Accreditation<br />Subfactor 3: Location</p>
<p><br />Part II: Pricing (Please include the cover page, cover letter, and table of contents that provides the curriculum of the course).</p>
<p>Factor 2: Price</p>
<p>The price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness based upon a comparison of the Offeror's price to the price of competitors. When two or more technically acceptable offers are received (competition) and the lowest price is selected, the price of the lowest offeror can be concluded to be fair and reasonable. A price that is very low will be verified to assure that the offeror understands what is being asked for and no mistakes have been made in preparing the price.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and FAR 15.403-3(a), information other than pricing data may be required to support price reasonableness or realism in the absence of competition. Information shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5. If after receipt of the proposals, the Contracting Officer determines that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the offeror shall be required to submit pricing data. The offeror is to complete the yellow highlighted areas for the costs of each CLIN within the Pricing Schedule (Attachment 4) and submit with the proposal, which will be evaluated for reasonableness. Do not make changes to the format of the Excel Spreadsheet in Attachment #4 without approval from the Contracting Officer. Proposed schedule is provided and is subject to change. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. Failure to provide prices as stated above may result in the rejection of the proposal. All pricing information shall be addressed ONLY in Pricing file format.</p>
<p>Technical Capability and Price are considered equal.</p>

<DESC><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-67 are incorporated into this RFQ.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) within the National Science Foundation (NSF) requires tabulated budget authority data (in current dollars, by federal fiscal year) from various federal agencies in order to complete its regularly-published detailed statistical tables on "Federal Funding for R&amp;D by Budget Function."</p>
<p>NCSES annual reports on this topic currently include 25 detailed statistical tables (see http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf13308/). However, the total number of tables may change somewhat from year to year, depending on the incidence of budget authority for R&amp;D across the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) 20 broad functional categories into which the overall annual federal budget is classified.</p>
<p>The NCSES statistical tables provide, in general, detail by budget function on the budget authority for R&amp;D and R&amp;D plant allocated annually by the Congress to the federal agencies and their major programs. The tables are constructed to provide such data for three consecutive federal fiscal years. Some of the tables are also of a summary nature, providing totals and subtotals across agencies and budget function categories.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance for this contract is one year, which provides for one complete cycle of compiling the necessary data and preparing/finalizing the detailed statistical tables. But the contract will also include 4 one-year option periods for successive extensions.</p>
<p><br /><strong>CONTRACT TASKS</strong></p>
<p>1) In the base year of the contract, the Vendor will draw on relevant data sources (including agency budget submissions to OMB per MAX Schedule C, agency budget justification documents, and supplemental data from agency budget offices) and prepare updated agency data on budget authority for R&amp;D and R&amp;D plant for the FY 2013 and 2014 data column entries listed in the NCSES Data Update, Federal R&amp;D by Budget Function, FY 2012-14. The Vendor will also draw on the data in the President's forthcoming Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2015 to add a corresponding data column for FY 2015 to all of the detailed statistical tables. The Vendor will provide text notes in the tables as relevant to documenting significant aspects and/or year-to-year changes in the data in the detailed statistical tables.</p>
<p>For Option Years 1 to 4, the Vendor will implement a corresponding set of data compilation and statistical table preparation steps, with elements as summarized in the following schedule:</p>
<p><br /><strong>Base Year</strong></p>
<p>Scope of agency budget authority data considered<br />FY 2013 (final)<br />FY 2014 (preliminary)<br />FY 2015 (proposed)</p>
<p>Main Period of vendor effort (expected) <br />February - September, 2014</p>
<p><br /><strong>Option Year One<br /></strong><br />Scope of agency budget authority data considered <br />FY 2014 (final)<br />FY 2015 (preliminary)<br />FY 2016 (proposed)</p>
<p>Main Period of vendor effort (expected)<br />February - September, 2015</p>
<p><strong>Option Year&nbsp;Two<br /></strong>&nbsp;<br />Scope of agency budget authority data considered<br />FY 2015 (final)<br />FY 2016 (preliminary)<br />FY 2017 (proposed)<br /><br />Main Period of vendor effort (expected)<br />February - September, 2016</p>
<p><strong>Option Year&nbsp;Three<br />&nbsp;<br /></strong>Scope of agency budget authority data considered<br />FY 2016 (final)<br />FY 2017 (preliminary)<br />FY 2018 (proposed)<br /><br />Main Period of vendor effort (expected)<br />February - September, 2017</p>
<p><strong>Option Year&nbsp;Four<br /></strong>&nbsp;<br />Scope of agency budget authority data considered<br />FY 2017 (final)<br />FY 2018 (preliminary)<br />FY 2019 (proposed)</p>
<p><br />Main Period of vendor effort (expected)<br />February - September, 2018</p>
<p><br />2) As an additional task, the Vendor will also prepare a compilation of the budget function data for each of the specified fiscal years consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) classification of government spending/funding for R&amp;D by major socioeconomic objectives (see http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/appendix.htm, table 4-45).&nbsp;NCSES will regularly review the content and format of the detailed data table for this compilation and advise on any issues that may arise due to OECD-originated revision of its socioeconomic categories or questions about the appropriate classifications of U.S. R&amp;D</p>
<p>3) The Vendor will be responsible for overseeing the quality of the data compiled into the detailed statistical tables, including performing edit checks for consistency across all totals and subtotals. The Vendor will provide a draft version of the complete set of statistical tables for NCSES to review and approve. Once any problems identified in the course of this review are resolved, the Vendor will prepare and deliver to NCSES a final set of these tables in as self-standing Excel files. In this final version, the table data cells will be values-only, free of formulas, and contain no linkages to other data files. (The intent is that this final version of the tables will be camera-ready and can be sent into the NCSES publications process with minimal further effort.)</p>
<p>The Vendor will maintain current records of all the activities and sources of information essential for conduct of the project. The documentation will be of sufficient depth to enable continuation of the data compilation effort into its next cycle and describe the basis for any substantial changes in the content and format of the data tables. The documentation will also include a version of the spreadsheets that includes all the relevant algebraic formulae and primary data.</p>
<p><br /><strong>SCHEDULE OF DELIVERABLES</strong></p>
<p>Base Year: All draft deliverables (tables and associated text) are due to NCSES on or before July 31, 2014. All final deliverables are due to NCSES on or before September 15, 2014.</p>
<p>Option Years 1-4: Similarly, all draft deliverables in each of the option years are due to NCSES on or before July 31 of, respectively, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. All final deliverables are due to NCSES on or before September 15 of, respectively, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018.</p>
<p><br />The anticipated period of performance is one year and shall include 4 one year option periods.</p>
<p><br /><strong>1. Technical Evaluation Factors:</strong></p>
<p>A. Demonstrated access to the federal data on R&amp;D budget authority essential for preparing the NCSES-defined statistical tables -- including from the Office of Management and Budget (e.g., the MAX data system), the Congress (federal budget appropriations processes), federal agency budget offices (agency appropriations data and estimates), other relevant federal sources.</p>
<p>B. Demonstrated experience in compiling the budget data from these diverse sources and preparing authoritative tabulations of federal budget authority for R&amp;D, with funding detail by OMB budget function, federal agencies, and key programs.</p>
<p><strong>2. Price:<br /></strong><br />Price will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit a quotation that includes:</p>
<p>&bull; A narrative describing the plan to accomplish the requirements of the statement of work and demonstration of the Technical Evaluation Factors.</p>
<p>&bull; A firm fixed price with rates for each year.</p>
<p><strong>Selection Criteria:</strong></p>
<p>The National Science Foundation intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract to the lowest priced technically acceptable quote.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Submission of Quotes:</strong></p>
<p>Quotes are due no later than 4:00pm, EST, January 23, 2014. Quotes are to be e-mailed to Jannele Gosey at jgosey@nsf.gov. No faxes will be accepted.</p>
<p>If you have questions regarding this requirement, please submit your inquiries, via email, to Ms. Gosey, no later than 4:00pm, EST, January 14, 2014.</p>

<DESC>This is a modification to the solicitation entitled 3.5" Swivel Eye Brackets which was posted on 01/14/2014. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. <P> Modification 01 is to post the below technical question and answer: <P> Question:  In the document titled Specification for NASA 3.5 Swivel Eye Bracket, notes 8 through 10 describe testing that will be performed on the required items prior to acceptance.  In prior events when the part has been manufactured 100% IAW DWG 90M11268, have there been failures when the product was 100% machined from the billet?  Do you anticipate failure of any items, if all specs are adhered to correctly?  Additionally, if there were a product failure, would the Govt withhold payment until all deliverables were tested and accepted? <P> Answer:  The drawing does not require load testing when parts are machined from a solid billet, only when fabricated from welded plate. However, the procurement specification does still require proof test for all swivel eye brackets, including those made from solid billet. Failure could still occur if sub-standard steel is used or if there are any problems during the heat treat process. <P> The due date for responses is not extended. <P> Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/MSFC Business Opportunities home page is <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=62">http://prod.nais.nasa .gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=62 </A>	  <P> Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). <P>

For the purposes of this provision and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the following terms shall have the meaning set forth below: (1) "Trade Secret" means an unpatented, secret, commercially valuable plan, appliance, formula, or process, which is used for making, preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles or materials which are trade commodities. (2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</span></p>

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons is seeking concerns having the ability for providing Residential Reentry Center (RRC) services and Home Detention services to be located&nbsp;within&nbsp;the City Limits&nbsp;of Portland, Oregon&nbsp;or&nbsp;within the City Limits of Salem, Oregon&nbsp;for male and female Federal offenders held under the authority of United States Statutes.
<p>Both the RRC services for in-house RRC services and the home detention services for home detention placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, August 2007; Revision 01, December 2007, CCB; Revision 02, December 2008, CCB; Revision 03, February 2010, CCB; Revision 04, May 2010, CCB; Revision 05, May, 2011, CCB; Revision 06, January 2012, RRMB; Revision 07, February 2012; Revision 08, January 2013, RRMB." Home detention services (for home detention placements) are specifically defined in Chapter 10, Programs, of the aforementioned SOW as well. This will be an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contract with firm fixed unit prices for Line Item 1 and Line Item 2.</p>
<p>The guaranteed minimum for RRC services for in-house beds is estimated to be 90% male and 10% female for the one-year base period and each of the four, one-year option periods thereafter, if options are exercised.</p>
<p>The estimated maximum for RRC services for in-house beds is estimated to be 84% male and 16% female for the one-year base period and each of the four, one-year option periods thereafter, if options are exercised.</p>
<p>For the Home Detention requirement for home detention placements, male and female quantities are combined for a total minimum guarantee and a total maximum estimate, which can be made up of either males or females.</p>
<p>For Line Item 1, the guaranteed minimum quantities and estimated maximum quantities for the RRC services for the in-house RRC beds requirement are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Base Period: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 18,250 (45 males and 5 females) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 43,800 (100 males and 20 females);</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 1: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 18,300 (45 males and 5 females) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 43,920 (100 males and 20 females);</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 2: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 18,250 (45 males and 5 females) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 43,800 (100 males and 20 females);</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 3: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 18,250 (45 males and 5 females) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 43,800 (100 males and 20 females); and</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 4: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 18,250 (45 males and 5 females) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 43,800 (100 males and 20 females).</p>
<p>For Line Item 2, the guaranteed minimum quantities and estimated maximum quantities for the Home Detention services (for home detention placement) requirement are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Base Period: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 5,475 (15 placements onto home detention) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 10,950 (30 placements onto home detention);</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 1: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 5,490 (15 placements onto home detention) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 10,980 (30 placements onto home detention);</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 2: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 5,475 (15 placements onto home detention) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 10,950 (30 placements onto home detention);</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 3: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 5,475 (15 placements onto home detention) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 10,950 (30 placements onto home detention);</p>
<p>&bull; Option Year 4: The guaranteed minimum number of inmate days is 5,475 (15 placements onto home detention) with an estimated maximum number of inmate days of 10,950 (30 placements onto home detention);</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Government to award both line items (RRC in-house beds and home detention placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available on or about January 22, 2014 and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website http://www.fbo.gov.

All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site.

<DESC>This amendment is to incorporate the sole source  justification for this requirement and to extend the award date from 01/17/2014 to 01/24/2014.
Sole Source Jusification: SEL is the manufacturer of these meters and has proprietary software and design.  Western Area & Power Agency (WAPA) is the on-site power provider for the Yuma Area Office (YAO), but YAO is responsible for providing and replacing the power metering system when necessary.  These meters need to interface with existing (WAPA) equipment and protocols.  In addition, these meters need to interface with current government equipment from different agencies so that power measurements can be implemented.

<DESC>This modification is to address questions received in response to this RFI:


1) For requirements outlined in 3.0 do you need resumes of candidates that can perform the work or simply capabilities / past performance of the business itself?

Companies submitting a response to this RFI need to demonstrate the required level of experience with Aqifer.NET programming as well as general programming capabilities.  Companies must have or be able to obtain security clearance commensurate with CAC requirements and system access within hosting environment of NMCI.  Resumes are accepted but not required.


2) Our business is based in Cary NC. Is it possible to perform the work remotely at a secure facility that complies with all specified requirements or does the work have to be performed at a NAVFAC HQ or FEC locations

We are not requiring an on-site person at headquarters; however, given the nature of the analysis-support component of the scope, it is often necessary to spend at least part of the day several times per week on-site at NAVFAC Headquarters.
  There is little to no travel budget in the scope.

<DESC>This requirement is for the Savannah Harbor Dredged Material Containment Area (DMCA) 14B Dike Raising and Weir Improvements.  The Scope of Work for this project includes the raising of the existing perimeter containment dike of the DMCA 14B.  The perimeter dike spans a length of 25,000 feet.  The crest of the  quote mark front dike, quote mark  or the stretch of dike that parallels the Savannah River, is currently at an approximate elevation of 33 feet MLLW.  The  quote mark back dike, quote mark  or stretch of dike that's opposite the front dike, is currently at elevation 25 feet MLLW.  The cross dikes transition in elevation from 33 to 25 feet MLLW.  This project will involve raising the current dike approximately 6 feet in height to an elevation range of 31 to 39 feet MLLW.  The construction of the new dike will be on the interior slope of the existing dike.  The design also includes a stability berm/counterweight on the inside toe of the new dike from Stations 52+00 to 157+00.  Approximately 760,000 cubic yards (CY) of fill material will be required for the raising.  This estimate includes the neat template volume required to fill the template (560,000 CY) and accounts for any settlement or displacement that may or may not occur during or prior to construction (200,000 CY).  Fill material will be obtained from the interior of DMCA 14B. Weir repairs are required for the four weirs that control drainage from the DMCA.  All four weirs will be relocated a distance of approximately 70 feet to the interior of the DMCA.
