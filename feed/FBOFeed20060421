Sloan, who has the knowledge and availability needed to provide these consultant services.  Don served as a DOE Headquarters Procurement Analyst overseeing many major source selections including the Idaho National Laboratory and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Mr. Sloan has served as the Chairman for several SEBs, including the SEB for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Mr. Sloan also developed standard Department training materials for SEBs and Source Selection Officials.  Mr. Sloan has worked in two DOE field procurement offices.  Mr. Sloanâ€™s availability and combined knowledge of DOE headquartersâ€™ and field policies, and his experience with major SEBs makes him the only source available to provide consultant services to the DOE-ORO Procurement and Contracts Division. Individuals who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the ability to provide above.  All interested parties must respond by 2:00 PM (EST), May 1, 2006, to Carol Jennings, AD-424, U.S. Department of Energy, 200 Administration Rd., Oak Ridge, TN 37830.  Email: jenningscs@oro.doe.gov. Also, send a copy please to Kay Brown at the same address.  Her Email address is:  brownkd@oro.doe.gov. No reimbursement for any costs connected with providing the capability information will be provided by DOE.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source bridge contract with Jupiter Corporation, while the follow-on competitive acquisition and transition is completed.  The follow-on competitive acquisition began with a Sources Sought Notice (DE-RP01-06SA06006) which was issued on March 13, 2006. This Sources Sought Notice requested capability statements from qualified small businesses for â€œOffice of Security and Safety Performance Assurance (SSA) Technical and Administrative Servicesâ€.  A draft Request for Proposals (RFP) for the follow-on acquisition is scheduled for release in May 2006 with the final RFP scheduled for release in June 2006. The proposed bridge contract will provide continued high quality standardized professional and administrative services to SSA. This support is currently being performed by Jupiter under contract number DE-AC01-04SO40405 and will expire on May 18, 2006. The mission of SSA is to develop strategies and policies governing the protection of national security and other critical assets entrusted to the Department of Energy, and to strengthen the Departmentâ€™ s National Security posture through conscientious, just and thoughtful application of Federal rules and statues governing personnel security to ensure that only individuals whose character, associations and loyalty are granted access to DOE classified information and materials.  The work performed under this contract includes the following specific tasks: visitor control request processing; initial clearance request processing; reinvestigation processing; reciprocal request processing to include Congressional and White House; clearance terminations, continuations, reinstatements, transfers, and upgrades; clearance notifications; personnel security file maintenance; investigative report screening, analysis, and adjudication; preparation of letters of interrogatory; personnel security interviewing; support to the DOE Administrative Review Program; transcription services; and psychiatric evaluation services.  The Performance Work Statement (PWS), Position Qualifications, and estimated level of effort for this Jupiter contract are provided on the Departmentâ€™s Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS). The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this contract is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 USC 2304[c][1], and implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyâ€™s requirements. Jupiter has the requisite number of key and non-key personnel possessing the required security clearances, technical skill and training, who are familiar with the program and requirements, and who are available to provide services pending the award of a competitive follow-on contract.  In addition, all personnel are required to have DOE â€œQâ€ level security clearances to perform work under this contract. Based on current experience, it takes at least 6 months and possibly as long as a year for the clearance approval process to be completed. There are approximately 20 individuals working on the existing contract.  If this bridge contract does not get approved, not only would there be a significant delay due to the time required to conduct a competitive procurement, but there would be additional delays in order for individuals to acquire the appropriate security clearances.  Jupiterâ€™s staff has the requisite knowledge and experience and required security clearances, and can proceed without interruption.  Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates: 1) the firm's ability to perform the work as described above; and 2) the firmâ€™s ability to provide the requisite personnel with the appropriate DOE â€œQâ€ level security clearances to perform work.  Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered within fifteen (15) days of this notice to: Ms. Irie Clarke, MA-643.2, 1000 Independence Ave, SW, Washington, DC 20585, or via e-mail to irie.clarke@hq.doe.gov   If a determination is subsequently made by the Government to compete for these services (planned to be provided under this bridge contract by Jupiter), a competition will be conducted for the three 3-month option periods.  It would not be possible to conduct this competition for the 6-month base period, and as described above, it is unacceptable to have a break in service for this work.  Thus, the bridge contract would continue during the entire 6-month base period while the competition is being held for the available option period(s) needed until the competitive acquisition under DE-RP01-06SA06006 is completed.   A determination by the Government not to proceed with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The intent of this award is to provide the required support services until the award and transition of a competitive follow-on acquisition is completed as described in the first paragraph above. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 541690. The period of performance of this bridge contract is for a total of fifteen months, consisting of one 6-month base period and three 3-month option periods. ***See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH
for
Development and Delivery of Highway Safety Training



The Government is conducting market research to:

·	Determine if sources exist that are capable of satisfying the Government’s requirements listed below,
·	Determine the capabilities of potential contractors, including an estimate of prices, 
·	Size and status of potential sources, and
·	Determine the level of competition (e.g., 8(a), small business set-aside or full and open)

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), National Highway Institute (NHI) plans to award multiple 5-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts for the development and presentation of Highway Safety Training. Training delivery methods may include traditional classroom, distance learning and/or computer-based self-teaching.  Successful offerors will be invited to compete for award of subsequent task orders that may also include other functions relating to highway safety training delivery such as needs assessment, marketing, or electronic formatting for Section 508 compliance.  Limited research necessary for development of technical reference manuals may be included.  Information about the NHI and its course offerings in the area of Highway Safety as well as the NHI style guide may be found on the NHI web site at www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov.  Additional courses or web-based offerings may be added as needs are defined. In addition to a thorough knowledge of instructional systems design (ISD) and adult learning principals, subject matter expertise may be required in a variety of areas.

The National Highway Institute (NHI) is the technical training arm of the Federal Highway Administration, and as such plays a vital role in the FHWA's overall effort to provide training in new and evolving highway related technologies.  The target audience is very broad, and includes Federal, state and local highway and transportation agencies located within the United States, the Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers, associations, consulting firms, private industry, universities and other national and international entities engaged in highway work of interest to the United States.  In order for NHI to best accomplish its training mission it is necessary to accurately determine the needs of the target audience, and then develop and deliver a variety of training packages that will most effectively and efficiently present the intended message. 

The NHI has been performing this role primarily by delivering traditional, instructor-lead, classroom training on a broad range of topic areas since it was established by congress in 1970.  However, the electronic era is rapidly opening new avenues for cost savings, complying with divergent schedules, and training larger audiences in shorter periods of time.  These avenues need to be explored and enhancements to the current approaches implemented.  

For this procurement, it is imperative that subject matter experts team with instructional systems design (ISD) specialists, internet content developers, experts in the development of multi-media training materials, and graphic arts to ensure that new course developments - as well as updates of existing NHI courses - incorporate state-of-the-art instructional systems design and adult learning principles.  Instructor-led course presentations require highly qualified, subject matter experts who have experience with deploying adult learning techniques in the classroom in compliance with Section 504 requirements.

This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement for the Governments consideration by submitting their product capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than  2:00PM local time on 8 May 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), in Washington, DC intends to award a firm fixed-price purchase order to the Southwest Consortium for Environmental Research and Policy (SCERP) of Tempe, Arizona under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain technical support for ground-level ozone concentrations based on satellite observations and surface monitoring for the U.S.-Mexico Border 2012 Program's environmental health  decisions. Under this order, SCERP will (1) assess the advantages of a combined satellite and monitoring data set for environmental health decisions leading to the development of a decision tool; (2) evaluate satellite data usability in the decision-making context; and (3) prepare a final report.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. It has been determined that SCERP is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement. Created in 1989 and first funded by Congress in  1990 to address environmental issues of the U.S.-Mexico border region and to initiate a comprehensive analysis of possible solutions to acute air, water, and hazardous waste problems that plague the U.S.-Mexico border region, SCERP has the unique capability to inform decision makers without  advocating for or against a particular position and interpreting results of unbiased scientific inquiry.   Since its founding, SCERP has implemented about 400 projects with its membership of five American universities and several universities in Mexico.  SCERP is the primary sponsor of an annual  think tank policy conference, called the Border Institute, which convenes the 100 top decision-makers and stakeholders from the U.S. border region.  In addition, SCERP's relationship with The Arizona State University provides immediate access to excellent transport modeling capability, which is  critical to the success of this project. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement may be considered. The estimated value of this procurement is  below the simplified acquisition threshold as set forth in FAR 2.101. Responses to posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Jami  Rodgers via the e-mail link below.

This municipal services maintenance training will, initially, take inventory of existing assets and asset management practices under the control of the relevant authorities (LWC, LMOE, LAWMA).  The training will then develop a generic maintenance management best practices model to be used by all of the authorities.   Finally, working individually with each respective authority, the training will develop a detailed maintenance program and implementation plan for each of the key environmental sectors.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Lagos Municipal Services Maintenance Training Technical Assistance include:

•	Develop an Environmental Infrastructure Asset Inventory 
•	Complete a Current Practices Review and Analysis
•	Develop a Maintenance Management Best Practices Model

Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis (LHC), plans to procure on a sole source basis, for Data collection of interviews, clinical assessment and blood from the Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST), with Duke University Medical Center (DUMC), Box 2949, Durham, NC 27510.  The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and 
the business size standard is $6M.  Background: The Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, requires the development of a database for and the performance of laboratory analyses of cord blood of neonates born to African-
American and non-Hispanic white women, who are smokers or non-smokers, as part of the study known as The Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST).  Exposures in utero will be examined in relation to methylation and imprinted genomic patterns in cord blood.  
Mothers of the newborns will provide reported information about prenatal events and maternal lifestyle during the index pregnancy and the maternal data will be linked to laboratory analyses of the neonate’s cord blood. In utero methylation patterns are established for life and DUMC is the only known laboratory in the United States with recognized capability to perform these analyses in humans.  The results of the data collection and laboratory analysis of the NEST, will contribute to NCI’s understanding of 
the potential role of methylation and imprinted genomics in two different ethnic groups in the United States as well as the role of maternal smoking in pregnancy on methylation
status of the newborn.  Because methylation patterns are established in utero, this pilot study will provide the first ever analysis of cord bloods in children of African American and non-Hispanic white descent.  This pilot study will also nvestigate whether maternal smoking and diet in pregnancy modify methylation status at birth.  Thus, the overall objective is to determine whether fetal exposures are related to risk factors for cancer, 
and to develop documentation of major early life exposures such as maternal smoking and diet during the pregnancy of the index newborn; perform laboratory analyses to identify epigenetic patterns at birth; and develop a database with coded items for 
subsequent analysis of the data.  DUMC has on its staff the Principal Investigators on the NEST, who are responsible for oversight of data and biospecimen collections as well as 
the laboratory analyses. The Department of Oncology at DUMC is where the major emphasis on genomic imprinting and cancer has evolved.  DUMC also has on staff the Principal Investigator for the cord blood bank at Duke Medical Center who has many 
years experience in biospecimen collections of population-based birth cohort data at birth. Period of Performance:  Estimated four (4) months.  Duke University Medical Center is the only known source that can provide the aforementioned requirements. 
Because all laboratory analysis including epigenetic methylation patterns from early life exposures have been performed at Duke University Medical Center and are approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Duke University Medical Center, this unit is the only source known to the NCI that is familiar with the original assays required as well as perfected the techniques used in cord blood methylation patterns and genetic profiles. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on May 5, 2006.  If you have any questions; 
please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist at gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Army Communications-Electronic Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) intends to award a new work modification to contract W15P7T-04-C-P019 on a non-competitive basis in support of the Massively Deployable Unattended Ground Sensor  (MDUGS) system.  The anticipated award will be made under the Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, to General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Inc. (GDAIS), Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Government does not p ossess detailed technical data for the MDUGS software and algorithms to provide to other potential sources.  MDUGS is an advanced networked acoustic and seismic sensor capable of detecting vehicle and personnel targets.  It is used to provide critical bat tlefield information for use by Warfighters to increase situational awareness.  The primary goal of the proposed R&D effort is to refine the distributed cluster management, imager change detection, and tracking algorithms; improve the operational life of e xisting hardware; integrate a military radio into the MDUGS hardware and develop an embedded gateway.  The MDUGS will be used to demonstrate critical technical elements in support of the Armys Future Combat System (FCS). This additional effort is expected  to have a period of performance of approximately 18 months. A tracking number of W15P7T-06-R-P026 has been assigned to this effort and should be referenced along with the contract number of W15P7T-04-C-P019.  TECHNICAL questions should be addressed to Ms.  Sharon Minor, email:  sharon.minor@us.army.mil, 703-704-3101.  CONTRACTUAL questions should be addressed to:  Ms. Virginia Knight, Contracting Officer, email: Virginia.knight@us.army.mil; 732 532-4348 or Ms. Susan Showler, Contract Specialist, email:  sus an.showler@us.army.mil; 732 427-1410.

Instructions to access technical data, a plan holders list  and the associated software required (viewers) to view the project plans and specifications can be accessed on the Omaha Districts Contracting Division web page (https://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/html/ct-m/webpage.htm ). PROJECT INFORMATION: Task orders under the resultant contract(s) will consist primarily of design and evaluation services in conjunction with the following: (1) Preparations of plans, specifications, and design analysis for the direct design of railroads, roadway pavements, bridges and specialized railroad support facilities.  (2) The inspection and maintenance recommendations for railroad tracks and bridges; (3) Field and laboratory testing of existing railroad/pavement sub-grades; (4) Roadway inspections and the use/training of personnel on PAVER Engineering Managements Systems for roadways and; (5) Specialized consulting services and engineering studies related to the planning, design, construction and evaluation of railroads and vehicular pavements.  The se services may consist of development/update of transportation systems engineering criteria.  Knowledge of the Armys RAILER computer program should be noted, but is not a selection criterion and is not required for selection.  Construction cost estimates  may be required for any of the design tasks listed above.   The scope of work for the optional small business set-a-side contract will be limited to item (4) above: Roadway inspections and the use/training of personnel on PAVER Engineering Managements Systems for roadways. It is likely that use of the metric system of measurement may be required for some deliverables under the proposed contract; however, metric system experience is not a selection criterion and is not required for selection. Construction cost estimates will be prepared using the Corps of Engineers Micro-Computer Aided Cost Estimating System (M-CACES) Second Generation (MII). (M-CACES software will be provided to the successful firm after contract award). Requirements for drawing preparation format are to be fully compatible with Bentley Microstation V8.5, or AutoCAD 2002 (minimum) depending on specified customer requirements.  A higher rating may be achieved for those firms that can demonstrate the ability  to work in both formats. Evaluation Ratings:.  The following evaluation ratings will be applied during the source selection process.  The application of a scale of words, or colors, used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard  for a non-cost factor.  For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives.  Ratings will be applied at the criterian and sub-criterian level.  If at any level of indentation an Offeror s proposal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirement (that is, below the level of Satisfactory), this fact  may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation.  Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterian level.  The following ratings will be used to evaluate th e submitted information. (i)	Outstanding  - Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards.  The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and h ighest quality performance are anticipated.  Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.  The offerors qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government.  The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the RFP  requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under the contract.  Significantly exceeds most or al l solicitation requirements.  Very high probability of success. (ii)	Above Average  - Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to exceed performance or capability standards.  Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government.  The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipat ed to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.  The offerors qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements.  The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government.  Full y meets all RFP requirements and significantly exceeds many of the RFP requirements. Disadvantages are minimal.  High probability of success. (iii)	Satisfactory (Neutral) - Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to meet performance or capability standards.  Acceptable solution.  Either meets all RFP requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas.  A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant le vel of performance will be achieved.  The proposal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the RFP requirements.  No significant advantages or disadvantages.  Equates to neutral. Good probability of success. (iv)	Marginal - The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion).   The offerors interpretation of the Governments requirements is so superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect as to be considered deficient.  Proposal does not meet some of the minimum requirements.  The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficienci es from affecting the overall project.  The offerors qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government.  Low probability of success although the submitt al has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable.  Significant disadvantages. Unsatisfactory  - Fails to meet performance or capability standards.  Unacceptable.  Requirements can only be met with major changes to the submittal.  There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved.  The proposal contains  many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Governments requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum requirements. Very significant disadvantages.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), National Highway Institute (NHI) plans to award multiple 5-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts for the development, updates, revision and delivery of its training courses in the broad general areas of Highway Safety.  Current NHI course offering in the areas of Highway Safety may be found on the NHI web site at www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov.  Additional courses or web-based offerings will be added as needs are defined.

The NHI is the technical training arm of the FHWA, and as such plays a vital role in the FHWA’s overall effort to provide training in new and evolving highway related technologies. The target audience for these courses is very broad, and includes Federal, state and local highway and transportation agencies located within the United States, Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers, associations, consulting firms, private industry, universities and other national and international entities engaged in highway work of interest to the United States.

In order for the NHI to best accomplish its training mission, it is necessary to accurately determine the needs of the target audience, and then develop and deliver a variety of training packages that will most effectively and efficiently present the intended messages.

The NHI has been performing this role primarily by delivering traditional, instructor-lead, classroom training on a broad range of topics since Congress established it in 1970. However, the electronic era is rapidly opening new avenues for cost savings, complying with divergent schedules, and training larger audiences in shorter periods of time. These avenues need to be explored, and enhancements to the current approaches implemented. 

In addition to subject matter expertise in the field of Highway Safety, offerors must have a thorough knowledge of instructional systems design and adult learning principals. Training delivery methods may include traditional instructor led classroom, distance learning and/or computer-based self-teaching.  Successful offerors will be invited to compete for award of subsequent task orders that may also include other functions relating to training delivery such as needs assessment, marketing, or electronic formatting for Section 508 compliance.  Limited research necessary for development of technical reference manuals may be required.

All qualified, responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer. The Government intends to award multiple contracts on the basis of best value after full and open competition. The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web site that lists all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date. The solicitation and related documents will be posted under the RFP number. Interested parties must download the RFP from that site. NO WRITTEN, TELEPHONIC, FACSIMILE, OR E-MAIL REQUESTS will be honored. However, interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements and notification of posting by e-mail. Please note that FedBizOpps has added a new feature called, Interested Vendors List. Those interested in teaming, subcontracting, supplying, consulting and the like should register, and prime contractors should review the names posted there. Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps Web site for any solicitation amendments.

The ESTIMATED release date of the RFP is April 28th. NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. 

ATTENTION: Minority, Women-owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises. The Department of Transportation, Short-Term Lending Program offers working capital financing in the form of revolving lines of credit to finance accounts receivable arising from transportation related contracts. Maximum line of credit is $750,000 with interest at the prime rate as published daily in the Wall Street Journal, plus 1.75%. For further information, call (800) 532-1169 x62852.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to answer questions that have been submitted regarding the above-mentioned solicitation. Question 1: CLIN 0006 for 6,000 each M148A1B1 Cartridges is not designated as an Option  under the RFP.  However, on page 37 of Section F, the delivery schedule for  CLIN 0006 is indicated as â€œ8 MAC option awardâ€.  Please clarify if the  Government intends CLIN 0006 to be an Option under the resultant contract.  Answer : Yes, CLIN 0006 is considered part of Option 2.  If Option 2 is awarded, the  expected delivery date of CLIN 0006 will be 8 months after the exercise of  Option 2.  In other words, if the FY08 Option is exercised will it include both CLIN 0005 and CLIN 0006. Question 2: As general information, the offeror requests identification of the end use for the M148A1B1 Cartridges. Answer: They are cartridge cases, not cartridges.  They are for Government inventory to be supplied to the 105mm contractors as GFM. Question 3: Paragraph 3.1 (pg 7): The offeror will require a certified Technical Data  Package List 13012536 in order to perform the tasks indicated in this paragraph; a certified list was not provided with the solicitation TDP. Answer: The TDP and associated documents are DRAFT.  In the Addendum to the TDP  included on the disk, there are two changes that are in the ECP process and  will be incorporated.  The first is the barcoding requirement; the second is  note changes to the cartridge case drawing.  At this time there are no other changes foreseen other than possible tolerance or minor dimensional corrections.  Testing will not be complete before the close of the RFP, but any  additional changes will not have any impact on the contractorâ€™s proposals. This should not preclude the contractors from proposing any of the requirements of the SOW.  At the completion of PQT testing, the TDP will be formally  certified. Question 4: Paragraph 3.1.1 (pg 7): Restriction of the nitrocellulose to the NTIB  Industrial Base has a potential cost impact to the Government.  In order to offer the most competitive prices for the M14 propellant, would the Government consider lifting this restriction?  Answer: No, the restriction is mandated by Industrial Base Team. Question 5: Paragraph 3.1.2 (pg 8) indicates the contractor will be responsible for the procurement of the PA117 containers for the first production year only.   However, Clause I.6, Schedule of Government Furnished Property, (page 57) it  appears containers for CLIN 0004, Option 1, in a quantity of 1,410 + 25% each  have been inadvertently omitted.  Please clarify PA117 containers for CLIN 0004  will be Government Furnished Property.     Answer: Yes, Clause I.6 does NOT show the cans for CLIN 0004.  There should be an  additional GFM quantity of 1,410 +/-25%. Question 6: Please confirm that the PA117 GFM containers will come equipped with the  internal pack components.  Answer: The PA117 GFM Containers will be the metal can only per Drawing 9378166,  Container, Ammo, Metal, PA117.   The contractor will still be responsible for  the procurement of the internal pack components. Question 7: Paragraph 4.2.3 (pg 12), Acceptance Inspection Equipment (AIE):  There appears  to be a conflict between submittal instructions provided in Paragraph 4.2.3.1,  CDRL A003 and Section E.11, ARDEC Clause 34 (pg 32).  Please provide an order  of precedence or amend the solicitation for clarity.    Answer: Section C, Paragraph 4.3.2.1 does not call out any submittal instructions.   Paragraph 4.2.3 states submittal is to be in accordance with CDRL A003 prior to  the manufacture of deliverable hardware.  CDRL A003 states â€œSubmit 30 days  prior to First Article or Production, if First Article has been waivedâ€.   Section E.11 states â€œshall be submitted to the Government for review and  approval as directed on the Contract Data Requirements List, DD FORM 1423â€.    All these statements refer to the CDRL A003.  There is no conflict. Question 8: Paragraph 4.2.3 refers to Section 4.2.1 which cannot be located within the SOW. Answer: The paragraph are numbered to reflect the following were inadvertently deleted  from the Section C.   4.1.2 Product Traceability and Lot Control 4.1.3 Verification of Purchased Product 4.1.4 Subcontractor and Vendor Audits 4.2 Quality Program Plan 4.2.1 Inspection/Test Plan Question 9: Paragraph 4.4 (pg 14): Lot Acceptance references LAT samples IAW MIL-C-70983A  that is a specification applicable to the M830A1.  Please verify MILSPEC is  correct. Answer: The MIL Spec reference should be deleted and replaced with Detailed  Specification DTL13012536 which is the specification for the M1040. Question 10: Paragraph 7.4.4.7 (pg 21) requires a complete electronic copy of the TDP in  Pro/Engineer format, version Wildfire 2 or later, within 30 days of contract  award.  In order to meet this aggressive schedule, it will be necessary for the  Government to provide the TDP in its native format for immediate conversion.    Can the Government supply the native format immediately or will relief to the  submittal date be granted? Answer: Once an award is made, a ProE Format TDP can and will be provided.  Question 11: Paragraph 7.10.3.1 (pg 23).  Will the successful bidder have access to the  document change history for all M1040 unique parts on the Systems Applications  Product (SAP) program? Answer: The TDP provided in the RFP is the baseline.  There is no change history in SAP. Question 12:  The ballistic samples of CE and CV are not deliverables.  We recommend removing  these from page 25.   Answer: No, it is the position of ARDEC Packaging office to leave as deliverables.  Question 13:  Similarly, pg 28 requires 5 pound samples of propellant be delivered for CV,  CE, First Article, Lot 1 and Lot 2 LAT and Lot 1 and Lot 2 production.   In  accordance with Section C.3.2, only â€œone 5 pound sample of propellant from each  lot of propellant used in cartridge lot productionâ€ shall be delivered.   Because only one lot is contemplated for the CV, CE, First Article and Lot 1  units, the schedule in Section D will be inconsistent with Section C  requirements.    Answer: Section D, Propellant Sample is revised to reflect that only one 5 pound sample  is required from each propellant lot.  Please disregard the list of items being  procured and the delivery schedule. Question 14:  E.10.c. (pg 32), ARDEC 33 Rework and Repair of Nonconforming Material:   Documentation on DD Form 1694 (Request for Deviation) is required for both  rework and repair items.  However, typically a Request for Deviation is only  required for rework items.  Offeror requests the DD Form 1694 be limited to  rework items only.   Answer: No, request denied.  Abide by the clause. Question 15:  E.13.f (pg 36), ARDEC 40 First Article Test (Contractor Testing): Request the  lapse in production period be extended from 90 days to 180 days to support  potential option awards at the most efficient price to the Government.     Answer: No, request denied.  It stays at 90 days. Question 16:  Section F, Deliveries or Performance: The offeror respectfully requests the  Government reassess the timing of the FAAT and LAT in relation to CLIN 0001  first lot deliveries.  Requiring delivery of the FAAT 90 days prior to first  deliveries and LAT 60 prior to first deliveries leaves the contractor only 30  days to LAP the entire cartridge lot following the standard Government testing  approval time.  Therefore, the base year production schedule appears overly  aggressive.  GD-OTS requests adjustment of the schedule to FAAT 9 MAC, LAT 11  MAC and first deliveries 12 MAC.    Answer: The Governmentâ€™s position is to leave it as is.  The Production Plan should  meet the SOW requirements.  Given the total contract quantity, nine months is  more than enough time. Question 17:  Offeror requests reopener language for both increases and decreases to the  price of steel.    Answer: No.  The Government is providing rate reopener language for the increase and  decrease to the price of tungsten, however, the Government does not believe  that steel is as volatile as tungsten. Question 18:  Section I.8 (pg 58), Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS): This clause requires  submittal of MSDS sheets prior to contract award.  It is requested that  submittal of the MSDS documents be changed to â€œwithin 60 calendar days after  contract awardâ€.    Answer: The Government approves this recommendation and hereby modifies the MSDS be  provided within 60 days after contract award. Question 19:  L.6 (pg 83), Evaluation of Offers/Quotes â€“ First Article Approval â€“ Contractor  Testing.  Because there is no requirement in Section B to separately identify  first article costs, the evaluation method associated with First Article Sample  waiver reflecting herein would not be applicable.  GD-OTS respectfully requests  deletion or modification of this clause.    Answer: Clause ARDEC 120 - Evaluation of Offers/Quotes â€“ First Article Approval â€“  Contractor Testing is hereby deleted. Question 20:  CDRL A003, AIE Design for Critical Characteristics: The total number of  required copies appears to total four (4); however, only three recipients have  been identified.  Please clarify if only three (3) copies will be required or  identify the fourth recipient.    Answer: It should be three copies, one to each of the recipients stated. Question 21:  Please provide the information that was apparently omitted from clause A.4.5 and A.4.7.      Answer: A.4.5.  Procurement Information X This Procurement is unrestricted A.4.7.  Additional Information  (i.e.;  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)  as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), this acquisition is restricted to  the following source:  N/A. Question 22:  Please confirm that CLIN 0001 and 0002 will both be awarded as part of the base  contract award. Answer: Yes. Question 23:  4. Section C, Paragraph 5.2.1--This paragraph references "Form DD254" but one was not provided with the solicitation. When will this be provided to offerors? What parts of this solicitation or work effort are considered to be classified?     Answer: Paragraph 5.2.1 states that entry of classified data onto any magnetic storage  device shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Form DD254.  There  is no classified data to be generated, transmitted, utilized, etc under this  contract. Question 24:  Section D and Section F.1--The quantities and delivery schedules listed in  Section D are in conflict with the quantities and delivery schedules listed in  Section F.1. Which are the correct quantities?   Answer: Section D.4 is revised as follows: 24         Ctgs  Propellant CE           3 MAC 20     	   Ctgs  Propellant CV           4 MAC 50    	   Ctgs  First Article           6 MAC 30    	   Ctgs  Lot 1 LAT               7 MAC  2050 +/- 20%      Ctgs  Lot 1            9 MAC Question 25:  Section D and Section F.1--The delivery section of Section F.1 does not include delivery requirements for the Propellant CE and Propellant CV cartridges contained in Section D. Shouldn't these be included in the F.1 schedule?  Answer: No, they do not belong in Section F.  Section F is contractual deliveries that  the Government pays for.  Propellant CE/CV cartridges are contractor items for  contractor testing.   Section D simply states estimated transportation  requirements, not contractual deliveries. Question 26:  Clause H.1 states that "The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 60 days". Within 60 days from what period (after base contract award)?    Answer: Within 60 days of the last delivery scheduled.   Question 27:  Clause H.5, Tungsten Rate Reopener Clause--This clause requires the contractor to lower his price if the price of tungsten decreases. This clause does not appear to include a re-opener if the price of tungsten increases from what was used by the contractor in their proposal. Shouldn't a re-opener clause work to both parties benefit?   Answer: H.5 Tungsten Rate Reopener Clause is revised as follows: The winning contractor agrees to negotiate the cost of tungsten with the  Government 60 days after award of each option, if exercised.   If the market  price of tungsten increases or decreases, the winning contractor will re-price  the negotiated effort using the adjusted price of tungsten and calculate the  cost impact.   The base index will be the price of tungsten in the London Metal  Exchange (LME) on the day the solicitation is issued.   The maximum amount of  any increase is 5% of the cartridge unit price.  No adjustment will be made for  any escalation amount that falls within +/-10% of the base index. Question 28:  We note that there are several paragraph numbers missing within Section C,   i.e.  4.1.2 through 4.1.6., etc. Answer: The information is complete in the SOW, however, the numbering was omitted. The paragraphs are numbered as follows: 4.1.2 Product Traceability and Lot Control 4.1.3 Verification of Purchased Product 4.1.4 Subcontractor and Vendor Audits 4.2 Quality Program Plan 4.2.1 Inspection/Test Plan Question 29:  According to the SOW and DD Form 1423 Block 4, the DIDs associated with the following CDRLs are supposed to be tailored but there is no information provided in the DD From 1423 Block 16 delineating how they are supposed to be tailored: A004, A006, A007, A010, A011, A012, A013, A017, A018, A021, A022, A024, and A025.    Answer: Please defer to the information provided in Block 16 and if there is a conflict  with the original.  If the information in Block 16 does not alter the original,  go with the original and ignore the word â€œTailoredâ€. Question 30:  13. CDRLs, A016 and A019, Block 4 state that the DID is supposed to be tailored. This does not agree with the SOW references plus there is no tailoring information in Block 16.  Please clarify.    Answer: Please disregard â€œTailoredâ€ in Block 4. Question 31:  We think that CDRL A026 on page 13 of 15 of the DD From 1423 should be corrected to read A027 and that the SOW reference in C.7.6 and C.7.6.2 should be amended to reflect this numbering change. Also, Block 16 should be updated to include the DID tailoring information.     Answer: In the SOW, A026 follows immediately after A025, so therefore it should be  numbered as it is.  Also, the SOW reference paragraphs are correct.  The  tailoring is in reference to the formatting being in the Section J of the RFP. Question 32:  In section B (page 6) should the total price for each CLIN be the unit price  multiplied by the basic quantity or the maximum quantity?  For example, for  CLIN 0001 should the total price be the unit price multiplied by 2,050 or 2,050  plus 25%?  If it is the higher quantity, adding 25% to 2,050 yields 2,562.5 (a  portion of a unit).  Please clarify.   Answer: The unit price shall be multiplied by the maximum quantity. Question 33:  There are no references to financing in the RFP.  We request that clauses  52.232-16, Progress Payments, and DFARS 252.232-7004, DoD Progress Payment  rates, be added via amendment to the RFP.  Answer: Clauses 52.232-16, Progress Payments, and DFARS 252.232-7004, DoD Progress  Payment Rates are hereby incorporated into the RFP.  Question 34:  In the event that the progress payment clauses are added, we request that the  acquisition of long lead production material be authorized since the schedule  does not afford the time to wait until the completion of first article to  acquire production material.   Answer: The Government will not authorize the acquisition of long lead production  material.  Question 35:   Section 4.3.1 includes requirements for FAAT.  Since separate FAAT CLINs are  not included in the RFP, should a full FAAT be assumed for PY1 and each option  and included as part of the unit price?   Answer: Full FAAT will be required for each option as part of the unit price. Question 36:  Section 3.1.2 (page 8) states that PA117 metal cans for option phases will be  GFM. Does this include the inner packing material for the cans?   Answer: The GFM will be the metal can only per drawing 9378166 Container, Ammo, Metal,  PA117.  No inner can packing will be provided. Question 37:  Clause I.6, Schedule of Government Furnished Property, lists PA117 cans as GFP  for only three option years (it appears to not include option 1) and is in  conflict with section 3.1.2.  Please clarify.   Answer: PA117 cans for Option 1 was inadvertently omitted from Clause I.6 and is hereby  included. Question 38:  Section D (page 25) states that bar coding is required.  Please provide details  of this bar coding requirement. Answer: The information concerning the 2-D barcoding requirement, titled â€œAddendum to  the M1040 TDPâ€, was included on the TDP disk that was available to all bidders  upon request.   Question 40:  The clause 52.245-2, Government Property (Fixed Price Contracts) is included in  the RFP.  Per the prescription in 45.103(b) it is requested that Alternate 1 to  this clause be added to the RFP.   Answer: The Clause 52.245-2, Government Property (Fixed Price Contracts) remains as is. Question 41:  The RFP includes two demilitarization clauses, 52.210-1000 (page 8) and I.3  (page 54).  It appears that the first clause may refer to an acquisition  regulation clause dated May 1963 that is no longer valid.  The current version  of the FAR shows section 52.210 as â€œreservedâ€.  It is requested that the  requirement to adhere to 52.210-1000 be deleted or further information be  provided.    Answer: FAR 52.210 is currently shown as reserved and Clause 52.210-1000 is hereby  removed. Question 42:  It is requested that FAR 52.225-8, Duty-Free Entry, be added to the RFP. Answer: No, since the components for the M1040 cartridges are being purchased within  the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB) (U.S./Canada).

<DESC>Section 1, Section 2, Section 3(d) and Section 3(e) of the original synopsis are hereby replaced in their entirety with the following:  REVISED SECTION 1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, proposes to obtain  the services for up to two (2) Indefinite Delivery Architect-Engineer (A-E) contracts for engineering, design and related services. These contracts are being procured in accordance with Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR subpart 36.6.  Firms will be sel ected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for required work.  One of the two contracts will be awarded initially with the remaining one, if awarded, will be awarded within 12 months depending on workload and contracting requ irements.

<DESC>I.  Introduction 

The USAID Mission in Yerevan has program responsibility for the formulation of 
Country strategy and implementation of a program designed to create a democratic society and market economy in Armenia. The Democracy and Social Reform Office (DSRO) is currently responsible for managing over 30 activities in these program areas, with an OYB of approximately $30 million annually.  DSRO staff currently consists of 2 USDHs, 3 USPSCs, 1 Population Leadership Program Fellow, 1 CASU, 1 TCN, and 7 FSNs (including 1 administrative assistant).  The DG SO team includes 1 USDH, 2 USPSCs (the incumbent, and 1 GS 14, Civil Society Advisor), and 2 FSN PSCs (FSN 12, Project Mgt. Specialist  and FSN 11, Project Mgt. Specialist (Media)).  Funding for USAID/Armenia’s DG activities totals approximately $11 million per year.  

The DSRO portfolio is large, complex and has four major components:

1.	In democracy, USAID Armenia’s goal is increased participation in civic life and more open governance institutions through which to channel participation, in order to stimulate the demand side for improved governance and to hold government institutions accountable through the democratic process.

2.	In healthcare, USAID Armenia programs focus on reforming the primary healthcare system to expand access to services, improve the quality of clinical care and pharmaceutical management, institutionalize greater transparency and accountability by healthcare managers and providers, and ensure sustainability of services.  The programs also aim to reduce urban-rural disparities in healthcare.

3.	In social protection, USAID Armenia’s goal is to strengthen national social sector  systems through institutional capacity building of responsible GOAM agencies, including the Ministry of Labor.  The areas of focus include pension and welfare reform; capacity building of the Labor Inspectorate, Employment Services Agency, and state-subsidized social assistance programs. The social sector portfolio also includes direct support to select NGOs that address the needs of the most vulnerable in society, in particular, orphans, the elderly, the disabled and the unemployed.

4.	In humanitarian assistance, USAID/Armenia provides subsistence level support for victims of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, including housing, water and sanitation infrastructure, primary health care, micro-credit and de-mining.   

Additionally, DSRO has special responsibilities for monitoring and contributing to achievement of the Mission’s cross-sectoral anti-corruption objective.  The Mission is committed to integrating anti-corruption efforts and considerations into all of its programs in all sectors.  As part of this overall effort, DSRO’s Democracy and Governance (DG) Strategic Objective team will manage a stand-alone activity to support civil society’s mobilization to combat corruption.

DSRO must, to varying degrees, coordinate each of these activities with a large group of multilateral donors.  These include the World Bank (WB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the European Union’s TACIS Program.  In addition, there are several bilateral agencies working in Armenia, including Germany’s Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID), and the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), among others.   

Political instability in the government and frequent changes in key counterparts complicate implementation of the DSRO portfolio.  Additionally, most key counterparts in the Government of Armenia (GOAM) have been educated in the former Soviet system and have had little international experience or education.  A considerable amount of time and resources must be devoted to re-educating them to Western standards.


II.	Duties and Responsibilities


The Senior Democracy Advisor (SDA) functions as the senior technical advisor providing support to the overall Democracy and Governance (DG) portfolio. On a day-to-day basis, the SDA is responsible for designing, managing, implementing, coordinating, and monitoring all components of the Mission’s DG portfolio.  The SDA provides the Mission with policy and financial analyses to advance USAID’s DG agenda for Armenia and advises the DSRO Director (FE00) and other Mission senior management on DG technical, programmatic and policy issues.  The SDA receives guidance from the DSRO Director and works independently and makes judgments/decisions as specified in this SOW.  The incumbent will have the authority to negotiate on behalf of the Mission regarding the DG portfolio.  The SDA serves as a key Mission spokesperson on matters related to DG in Armenia.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement, and as such does not constitute a solicitation of proposal, and authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract for the contemplated effort has not been received and funds are not currently available. NAVSEA Indian Head Division, Maryland, is seeking sources of an electromagnet to be built to existing drawings The magnet consist of six coils. A steel metal pole is placed in the interior of the coils. Each coil  will have an approximate ID of 8”, a width of 2.25 inches and a approximately 15 inches in outside diameter. Each coil will be wound with approximately 3000 feet of 12 gauge “forvar” coated copper wire. The windings will be coated with Crest 7450 epoxy or equivalent. A steel frame assembly holds each set of three coils ten inches apart. The electromagnet will be installed in a large cylindrical tank. In one end of the tank a  3.25”, 1.6” or 4.0”  ID gun barrel will extend into the tank. The gun will launch a projectile that will impact a target placed in the center of the magnetic field produced by the electromagnet.  The vendor shall provide a bracket to center the magnet so that center line of magnet coincides with projectile path. The vendor shall provide instrumentation and fixtures to map the magnetic field, and a power supply to supply 20 amps of electrical current  to the magnet. The vendor shall provide cables and  an feed thru assembly to  feed wires into the tank.  The vendor will provide a system to allow the magnet to be installed and uninstalled. Ideally a fork lift would not be required. Additional capabilities that may be required are the fabrication of non-magnetic gun barrel extensions. These extension will connect to the existing gun barrel and will extend into the magnetic field of the ma!  gnet. Ideally, a design that would not require existing gun barrel sections to be shipped to an outside machine shop. Another capability that may be required is to provide target holders to align the target to within 0.0003 radians of projectile face and to measure the projectile velocity with a series of optical sensors. Ideally the target holders  and velocity sensors could be easily replaced as they would be likely destroyed in each gun firing. The vendor will install the system and perform the initial magnetic field mapping. Potential vendors are requested to send capability statements to NAVSEA INDIAN HEAD, Attn:  Audrey Cosgrove, 101 Strauss Avenue, Indian Head, MD  20640 or email at audrey.cosgrove@navy.mil.   Capability statements shall address (1) the vendor’s technical capability in meeting the above requirements, (2) any relevant experience, previous contracts, etc, and (3) any other product/company literature that would be applicable.  All information shall be provided by 3:00 pm Eastern Standard Time on May 17th, 2006.

The USMC goal is to define unit cost for our end-to-end products and services and establish performance metrics for benchmarking with other DoD entities. Purpose The primary purpose of this information request is to: (1) solicit information for consideration regarding Common Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software capabilities which are consistent with current planning activities, deployment schedules, data collection capabilities, and interoperable with existing USMC legacy systems and other industry standard (COTS) software.  (2) identify capabilities, concepts, and methodologies for reengineering the Marine Corps ABC program (to include architecture) through use of industry standard ABC methodologies throughout the Marine Corps Business Enterprise (all activities spanning strategic, operational, and tactical levels).  (3) determine if there is credible vendor interest in the integration, deployment, and sustainment of a system/software as described above.  Application Requirements Any recommended software application(s)/system must comply with NMCI requirements, and utilize standardized software communications interfaces and protocols in order to facilitate secure, reliable communication with the existing Enterprise Shared Data Environment (ESDE).  The current ESDE utilizes Microsoft Data Access Components, and allows data driven client/server applications to communicate  using ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), or OLE DB for deployment over the World Wide Web (www) or a Local Area Network (LAN).  Additionally, any recommended application/system must be able to integrate information/data from a variety of sources, both relational (SQL) and non-relational databases and the ESDE.  Any recommended software application(s) must also communicate with the existing ESDE utilizing Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) compliant interfaces.   Submission Requirements Elaborate proposals or pricing information is neither required nor desired, as the intent is to identify credible interest before federal or nonfederal resources are committed to expensive studies or proposals.   The statement of interest shall include as a minimum the following components: (1) what systems and or software, if any, you currently have that could accommodate this need, (2) your entity’s capability and experience in developing this type system, use of software and deployment capability.  (3) Submissions should also include the description of an approach to achieve the reengineering objectives of the ABCM program, software product, deployment schedule, integration capability and personnel prerequisites and training.  Responses should be limited to 15 pages or less. Responses to this RFI are due on or before 2:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on 19 May 2006.   Responses may be mailed to the Commanding General, Regional Contracting Office, Northeast (RCO), Attention: Carol Neely, Marine Corps Base, 3250 Catlin Avenue, Quantico, VA  22134.  Federal Express or hand-delivery address is Commanding General Regional Contracting Office, Northeast (RCO), Attention:  Ms. Carol Neely, Marine Corps Base, 2010 Henderson Road, Room 206, Quantico, VA  22134-5001. Additional Information THIS NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO  AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. As industry may see portions of submitted information in future solicitations, NO PROPRIETARY OR COPYRIGHT INFORMATION SHALL BE SUBMITTED. In addition, you may submit information regarding existing contracts where your ABCM and reengineering services are available under GSA contracts.

<DESC>The attached RFP is in addition to Special Notice DON-SNOTE-060413-001 The Deployable Virtual Training Environment (DVTE) is the USMC portable simulations system. DVTE will be the Battalion Commander’s training simulation tool and fielded to the battalion level. As such a DVTE suite must be capable of operating in the battalion classroom, aboard ship, and at other locations to support the required flexibility and responsiveness to battalion and lower level training. This will require that each DVTE suite be user friendly to the degree that it will not require contractor support in order to set up and configure to support the selected training. DVTE consists of two training modules, these are the Tactical Decision-making Simulations (TDS) and the Combined Arms Network (CAN). The focus of this RFP is on the CAN and all inference to DVTE from henceforth will imply the CAN unless otherwise stated.  All comments should be submitted to LtCol Greg Caldwell at: gregory.r.caldwell@usmc.mil.   The submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure any items/services, or for the government to pay for the information received

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with U.S. Laser Corp, 825 Windham Court North, Wychoff, NJ 07481 for the upgrade of a Government owned U.S. Laser 406-1 Nd:YAG laser with maximum power 500 W, which has provided calibrations reliably for ten years. A new project requires the laser power to be upgraded to 1000 W level.  NIST's space, cooling water supply and electricity are suitable to upgrade the existing 406-1 laser to 408-2 laser, which will provide maximum power of 1400 W (1000 W with fiber output).  The flash lamp pumped Nd:YAG laser made by U.S. Laser has proportional cooling water flow control, which  provides better laser stability than the on/off method. U.S. Laser requires a trade-in of the 406-1 laser head to upgrade it to 408-2. NIST requires an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) type laser.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Under $100,000). This synopsis is issued for information purposes. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Anticipated award date will be May 9, 2006.

<CONTACT>CLAUDIA M. ARMSTRONG, Contract Specialist, Phone: 202-564-6679, E-Mail: armstrong.claudia@epa.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) anticipates awarding a five-year, fixed rate, blanket purchase agreement (BPA) for logistical support services as outlined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) below. This notice is a Request For Information (RFI) ONLY. The purpose of this notice is to determine the interest of small businesses for this requirement. The EPA seeks responses to this notice from all types of small businesses including small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) businesses, woman-owned small businesses, hub zone businesses, service disabled veteran owned small businesses, and other socioeconomic groups addressed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation. EPA requests that industry review the logistical support requirements and address (a) and/or (b) below: (a)	Contractors with expertise in areas outlined in the PWS are invited to provide comments regarding the feasibility of the Government?s plan to use a BPA as the acquisition tool and the degree of interest that such a vehicle might generate, along with comments regarding other potential approaches.  (b)	Contractors with the capability of providing services defined in the PWS are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information within the page limitation (max. 10 pages, excluding comments on (a) above) which demonstrates their ability to fulfill the requirements. Responses are necessary to demonstrate capabilities/expertise in all aspects of the SOW and standard company brochures are not desired. Responses, including the contractor?s Small Business status should be submitted via e-mail or mailed to the addresses provided at the end of this document. EPA intends to review the comments and qualification statements from industry and reserves the right to issue a formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) for commercial services, as identified herein, using simplified acquisition procedures.  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: NATIONAL SUPPPORT LOGISTIC SUPPORT SERVICES PURPOSE/ BACKGROUND  The purpose of the National Logistical Support Services Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is to provide logistical support to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs) and other federal officials implementing EPA?s responsibilities.  EPA has recognized the critical need to have the ability to provide immediate housing accommodations, food services, communication capabilities, security, and other support services for personnel responding to emergency situations. Currently, U. S. EPA Region 6 (Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and 65 Tribes) and other Gulf Coast territories are the primary geographical areas for which these services are required. However, other U.S. EPA regions may utilize the services offered under this BPA when responding to an emergency.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires logistical support services for EPA employees and other support personnel during emergency response and/or Incidents of National Significance (INS). As essential personnel are deployed throughout the United States to areas devastated by disaster, without electricity, running water, sanitation, shelter, and other facilities for indefinite periods of time, sufficient logistical support services must be made available to ensure the safety and well-being of our response personnel.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION & REQUIREMENTS The contractor shall have the capability to provide logistical support services for a wide range of emergency situations. The contractor shall be required to provide any and all of the general services identified in this PWS. Any small business that is selected shall be subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14, Limitation on Subcontracting. Associated costs pertain to the mobilization and demobilization of any or all services, to include restoration of building and grounds. EPA shall provide a site specific purchase order upon activation of this agreement. When the specific incident occurs, EPA will issue a purchase order, under the BPA, as the tasking document to the contractor which provides incident specific details and mission requirements. The performance period for the BPA will be 2 to 5 years and the specialists shall be required to have a response time no greater than 24 hours. Under any resultant agreement or contract, the contractor shall have an electronic system that tracks all site specific costs expended and generate reports that document the costs related to their expenditures on that site. If a contractor does not have an electronic tracking system, they will be required to use a system EPA has established. The report shall be submitted to a designated individual on a weekly basis. EPA requests that contractors specify whether they have an electronic cost tracking system and the extent of its capabilities.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCE SEEKING SYNOPSIS AND NOTFICATION OF INDUSTRY DAY ONLY.The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.     This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid.     The intent of this INDUSTRY DAY [16th March 2006 at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) facility Edwards AFB, CA] is to obtain market research on the details for the Draft BAA announcement.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis. Information will be released in sections.     Therefore, entities who wish to participate in this market research should maintain an awareness of this website.The Air Force is initiating major efforts to develop new or enhanced technologies that will lead to the transition of the new technologies into propulsion systems for operationally responsive space lift system. AFRL planning has identified that new technologies are required to develop a highly operable rocket engines. Identification and demonstration of these technologies is critical to retire the risk for high performance, highly operable rocket engines.  The goal is to develop and test a technology test bed for a booster-class, hydrocarbon fueled engine that is highly operable while traceable to Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) Phase II goals. The program goal will be to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the engine via component and integrated system testing thorough a TRL 5 technology demonstrator engine. The technology development efforts to be conducted by any contract awarded through the eventual BAA will be conducted under the guidance of the IHPRPT program. Although not mandatory, it is highly recommended that a prospective offeror have either a government coordinated Advance Rocket Propulsion Plan (ARPP), or develop an ARPP prior to or in conjunction with proposal submittal, or have a documented working relationship with a company possessing a government coordinated ARPP to ensure IHPRPT relevance of any proposed technology.  In addition, as part of ensuring IHPRPT relevance, the offerors will be expected to define quantitatively the proportion of the overall IHPRPT goals each component technology will contribute (i.e. the technology objective), how these individual contributions or objectives “roll-up” to assure the achievement of the overall goal, and identify the means by which achievement of the objectives will be measured. Information regarding the IHPRPT programs in general and the ARPP process is available at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Edwards AFB, CA. Legitimate entities capable of receiving ITAR restricted information and interested in participating in this INDUSTRY DAY should contact Steve Hanna at stephen.hanna@edwards.af.mil .

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for purchase of 25 each, ACU, Processor (Standard), P/N VGMD G3/G4; NSN:  5895-01-519-4485. This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The company is Synergy Microsystems, Inc., dba Curtiss-Wright Controls, 10201 Wateridge Circle Drive, San Diego, CA.  The Synergy Processor, P/N VGMD G3/G4, functions as the central control processor within the Automated Surface & Operation System (ASOS) for collecting surface weather observations.  The processor board functions with the ASOS using specific designed firmware written to specific requirements by PRISM Communications. Any other manufacturer’s processor board, except the Synergy P/N VGMD G3/G4, could render the ASOS inoperative. The use of other manufacturer’s processor boards would require the government to host completely different firmware and require a redesign of the ASOS at a very significant cost to the government that would not be recovered through open competition. The government believes it is in their best interest to acquire these assemblies from Synergy Microsystems, Inc. in order to support the ASOS program. However, all proposals received within 10 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the government.

Test set requirements: (1) The O-Level test set, hereinafter referred to as the test set, shall emit a detectable test signal recognizable by the AN/AAR-47(V)1/(V)2/A(V)2 Missile Warning System to verify sensor functionality and determine sensor sensitivit y at the organizational and operational levels.    (2) The test set shall consist of a ruggeddized shipping / storage container, a battery operated, self-contained, hand-held programmable signal generator/emitter, a removable filter (if applicable), a batt ery charger, and provisions for a spare lamp and battery.  The test set shall be used in ground and shipboard environments.  Operation of the test set under all environmental conditions shall not result in damage or degradation of the AN/AAR-47(V)1/(V)2/A( V)2 performance.   Must provide a display that is clearly visible in low-light and sunlight conditions.  (3) Operating Life: the test set shall be designed to have a useful operating life of fifteen (15) years when maintained in accordance with applicable maintenance procedures.   (4)  The test set shall weigh no more than 25 lbs.  The programmable signal generator/emitter (with battery installed) shall weigh no more than fifteen (15) lbs and shall not exceed twenty (20) inches in length nor have a diameter  greater than six (6) inches.   (5) The test set shall have a predicted useful life of at least 5000 hours mean time between failures (MTBF) when operated under conditions specified herein.  A failure is defined as any fault that requires unscheduled maint enance as a corrective action.  The MTBF shall be calculated in accordance with MIL-HDBK-217.  Replacement of lamps, fuses, batteries, and desiccants shall not be considered failures for reliability.   (6) Electronic Discharge: the contractor shall comply with the requirements of MIL STD 1686.   (7)  Interface with the AN/AAR-47(V)1/(V)2/A(V)2 MWS: the range of operation for end-to-end functional systems testing shall be no less than fifteen (15) meters from the sensor.  The test set applications environmen t will be fixed and rotary wing, high velocity, low/slow, transport and civil aircraft.    (8) Organizational Level Test Signal: the test set shall emit a detectable test signal recognizable by the MWS.  The range of operation for the test s ignal shall be from 0.15 meters up to a minimum of fifteen (15) meters from any sensor.   (9) Sensitivity Signal: the test set shall emit a detectable sensitivity signal at an irradiance level which, at a zero (0) meter distance, or ability to block ambien t UV sources, and will generate a constant 70,000 counts per second within a tolerance of +/- 10%, for a sensor with a normalized photon irradiance response (PIR) of 1.0.    (10) Operational End-to-End Signal: the test set shall emit a detectable signal in  the operational (normal) mode which will in turn trigger both an indication on the AN/AAR-47s control indicator and dispense command to the countermeasures dispensing systems (CMDS) such as the ALE-39/40/47 system.  (11)  The test set must remain in cali bration, and not require factory calibration after delivery.     Interested parties capable of providing a test set, which meets or exceeds the above requirements, shall provide a Statement of Capability (SOC) that demonstrates the existing capability to provide, modify, and sustain the system and a description of syste m capabilities.  The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify system capability as related to the technical effort requested above.

<SUBJECT>16 -- PAR Pneumatic Assisted Release Bomb Rack
<DESC>PAR Pneumatic Assisted Release Bomb Rack


The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of a notice of intent to issue a sole source contract for a development study of the replacement of the BRU-56 bomb rack with a new designed pneumatic assisted release bomb rack. This effort is to provide follow-on design/test and study effort to the Pneumatic Assist Release (PAR) proof-of-concept demonstration efforts conducted on the B-1B in 2003-4.  The PAR utilizes a pneumatic actuation system which is planned to ultimately replace the current pyrotechnic-activated bomb racks (BRU-56) used on the B-1B aircrafts’ Multi-Purpose Rotary Launchers (MPRLs).  The period of performance is tentatively scheduled for August 2006 – August 2007 time frame and will be issued to EDO Corporation, EDO Defense Systems, 1500 New Horizons Blvd, North Amityville, NY 11701.

AUTHORITY:  10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), and 9.505-2 paragraph 3.  Only one responsible source and no other supplier or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  

The Air Force’s requirements can only be met by EDO Corporation.  EDO Corporation is the source that built the proof-of-concept prototype PAR and conducted and supported testing and analyses.  As such, EDO is the only company that offers the advantages of being able to piggyback seamlessly from their proof-of-concept and provide the transition to follow-on SDD in the 12 month timeframe required to meet ACC’s need.  SDD contract award schedule for FY08 would experience significant delays if any other contractor was selected.  Significant additional cost would also be required to complete the tasks that EDO is being contracted for, since a new contractor would have to duplicate effort in order to arrive at the point that EDO is now.

EDO Corporation furthermore offers the additional benefit of being able to leverage existing in-house technology for application to our specific PAR product.  This stands to benefit the government in terms of being able to obtain more value for the dollars expended, and also provide accelerated insertion into the B-1 PAR.


This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract to EDO Corporation, Inc. for follow-on development study to design, develop, and demonstrate operational pneumatic assisted release bomb rack for the B-1. 

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for either the effort or associated costs to respond or for the information provided.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) for this sole source acquisition is 541710.  The points of contact are Randy Hall, Program Manager, at e-mail:  Randy.Hall@wpafb.af.mil,   phone (937) 656-5040 and Tim Bateson, Contracting Officer, at e-mail:  Timothy.Bateson@wpafb.af.mil, phone (937) 656-5073.

<SUBJECT>A -- On-Board Turbine Blade Health Sensor
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for a non-developmental engine diagnostic system for monitoring blade tip frequency response in the Pratt & Whitney F100 engine.     The United States Air Force operates F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft powered by the F100 engine.     These turbine engines have multi-stage rotating components that have unique vibratory responses that shift due to changes in the operating environment related to airflow, blade tip clearances, engine speed, or component damage, etc. The diagnostic system must serve to detect and warn of frequency response changes due to propagation of pre-critical LCF and/or transient HCF component cracks by fusing real-time state awareness sensor data with advanced predictive algorithms.

This diagnostic system must be non-developmental. Potential respondents must have demonstrated the system capability on a fielded system for a multi-aircraft fleet. The system must be self-contained and not require integration with an existing engine control or monitoring system. It must maintain operability in the engine-operating environment including temperatures up to 1500C, pressures up to 10 Mpa, and vibration up to15g.

Potential respondents should possess the technical ability to perform an advanced diagnostic system verification task. This task includes the F100 engine system integration, related fabrication and assembly, performance parameter verification, data analysis, and reporting.     The Government does not presently intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, but wants to obtain market information or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.     Submission of a response is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated.     Routine communications concerning this special notice should be directed to Sandy Roche, Contract Negotiator, at (937) 255-5389, or Robin Bartley, Contracting Officer, at (937) 656-9766.

Potential sources should submit information describing their non-developmental engine diagnostic system to Sandy Roche, AFRL/PKPB, by e-mail (sandy.roche@wpafb.af.mil) by 22 May 2006.   Submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length.

<SUBJECT>69 -- Warrior Reach & JDICE
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division, Orlando intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and award to CACI Inc.- Federal (CACI), 14151 Park Meadow Dr  Chantilly , VA. 22556 a contract for procuring  a functional, deployable capability to support USSOCOM Joint Task Force efforts in the Global War on Terror (GWOT).  Specifically, USSOCOM requires the rapid fielding of a prototype WARRIOR REACH capability for operational assessment prior to follow-on procurement and fielding.  WARRIOR REACH component technologies, to include the Joint Data Translator (JDT), are also necessary to support ongoing OSD Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) projects of high interest to USSOCOM.  These JT&E projects include the Joint Datalink Information Combat Execution (JDICE).    
The anticipated date of award is 15 May 2006. The Period of Performance for this purchase shall be for a period of four (4) months after award. Contract shall be Time and Materials (T&M).
This action will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).
CACI, Inc. – FEDERAL, (hereafter called CACI) is the sole developer of the JDT software and is currently under contract to USSOCOM and Other Government Agencies (OGA) for JDT software development and integration.  CACI personnel gained extensive experience and expertise during the development of JDT software for the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) Special Operations Forces Signals Training and Rehearsal System (SOFSTARS).  The SOFSTARS architecture is the baseline for WARRIOR REACH development and is the other known similar architecture developed to support Special Operations requirements.  CACI’s extensive expertise and knowledge of WARRIOR REACH components and their integration requirements, coupled with their prior SOFSTARS experience, uniquely qualifies for CACI for this task.  As such, the JDT software development and testing time will be reduced and the software will be provided at an overall lower cost to the Government.  CACI enjoys the full confidence of the HQ Air Force Air Intelligence Agency’s (AIA) Technical Lead for WARRIOR REACH.  This confidence is derived from CACI’s past performance on SOFSTARS, as well as similar task for AIA and OGA.  CACI fully understands the schedule criticality for the JDT development effort and can meet the government need.
Therefore, CACI is considered the sole source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment and experienced personnel necessary to successfully fulfill the government’s requirements within current budget and time constraint.
 A solicitation will be issued on or about 21 April 2006.
This procurement will result in  a T&M contract. See numbered note 22. 
A determination not to compete this proposed action is solely within the discretion of the governement.

Note 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Ken Kaseforth, (612) 713-5219 Contract Specialist 6127135219 Ken_Kaseforth@fws.gov;
<DESC>(i)		This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. (ii)	Solicitation number 301816Q016 is being issued in a Request For Quotations (RFQ) format. (iii)	This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-08. (iv)	This is a 100% Small Business Set Aside (SBSA) under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2 only on condition that at least one responsible small business submits a responsive quote with a grand total price of less than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. Under the defining North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 532412, a business is considered "small" if it does an average of less than $6.5 million in annual gross receipts [all affiliated businesses included; an affiliate is defined for these purposes as a business concern or individual who, directly or indirectly, (1) controls or can control the other, or (2) is a third party that controls or can control both]. All bidders must disclose their appropriate size standard in the submitted quotation(s) in order for the quotation to be considered responsive to this solicitation. (v)	[See (vi) below for specifications and situational information and conditions]  Line Item 0001: Rental of three (3) scrapers for the 12-week period of May 21 through August 12, 2006; Line Item 0002: rental of one (1) vibratory soil compactor with sheepsfoot drum for a two-month period, from June 1 through July 31, 2006; Line Item 0003:  rental of one (1) vibratory soil compactor with smooth drum for two months, from June 12 through August 11, 2006; Line Item 0004:  Transportation, permitting,  mobilization and demobilization of all three (3) scrapers; Line Item 0005: Transportation, permitting,  mobilization and demobilization of the sheepsfoot drum compactor; and Line Item 0006: Transportation, permitting,  mobilization and demobilization of the smooth drum compactor.  Quotes are to include a Grand Total price which, if different from the sum of the Line Item lump-sum subtotals, will be deemed as either a discounted or surcharged (whichever is appropriate) firm fixed price from the bidder.   (vi)	This earth-moving rental equipment (to be rented without operators) will be used for the construction of a two-lane gravel entrance road of about 6/10 mile in length, two parking lots and a four-acre wetlands area, all within the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) near Oak Harbor, Ohio 43449.  The land there is flat and composed of topsoil and clay, with few rocks.  All of this rental equipment will be needed seven days a week throughout the rental period(s), with each unit of equipment's estimated usage ranging from 250 to 300 hours per month.  Each piece of rental equipment must be in full operational condition at the time of delivery and must remain in reasonable operating condition, operator-error excluded, for the duration of the rental period. Also, bidders must clearly explain what backup(s), if any, will be available in case mechanical breakdowns occur during this construction period, which is a critical timeframe because of negative impacts on Refuge wildlife at other times of the year.  The following specific pieces of earth-moving/road building equipment will be needed:  three (3) scrapers (each with an approximate capacity of 17 yards and an approximate engine power of 265 HP); and two (2) vibratory soil compactors (both with approximate size of 84 inches and approximate engine power of 150 HP), one  with a sheepsfoot roller and the other with a smooth drum roller.  For quotes to be considered responsive, the following information must be included for each of the five (5)  pieces of proposed rental equipment:  (1) the brand and model; (2) year of manufacture; (3) number of total hours of operation [each piece of equipment must be metered, and the meters must be in working order and accurate]; (4) number of hours since last major overhaul, if applicable; and (5) overall  operating condition, self-rated as applicable if in used condition as "poor", "fair" , "good" or "excellent," or   "new" if never before used.   All three scrapers must be available and ready for use seven (7) days per week throughout the aforementioned twelve-week rental period.  The two rollers will be needed throughout their two-month periods of rental.  All rented equipment must be delivered to the Refuge free of vegetation in order to avoid introduction of exotic or noxious plant species into the Refuge. (vii)	Delivery of the rental equipment shall be made F.O.B. Destination to the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge, located near Oak Harbor, Ohio 43449. Delivery shall be completed prior to the beginning of the rental period. Contractor shall be responsible for removing ("demobilizing") the  equipment following the end of the rental periods.  Contractor's firm fixed price quotes within the mobilization/demobilization Line Items shall include all necessary transportation and permits costs to and from contractor's site (there are no monetary Refuge permits required). (viii)	The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition (FAR provisions and clauses are available for review at http://www.arnet.gov/far). (ix)	All responsible sources may submit a quotation, each of which shall be considered by the agency.  All responsive quotes shall be evaluated using the following factors, ranked in descending order of importance:  price; working condition of the equipment; availability during the designated period of performance (including backup capability); quality of determinative information provided for evaluation of the proposed rental equipment;  past business performance and reputation; and additional availability of the same or different but comparable equipment before and after the stated periods of performance.  Quotes must address all of these factors to be considered responsive. (x)	Each offeror shall complete, and include with its quotation, FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.  Failure to submit this provision, properly completed, may result in a non-responsive quotation. (xi)	The FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. (xii)	FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items pertains as applicable to this acquisition.   (xiii)	[N/A] (xiv)	[N/A] (xv)	[N/A] (xvi)	Quotes shall be due in the FWS Region 3 CFM Office at Fort Snelling, Minnesota 55111-4056 by 4:30 p.m. CDT on May 5, 2006.  Mailed and faxed quotes (including a completed FAR clause 52.212-3 and a list of at least three recent and comparable job references with points of contact) shall be submitted to the attention of Ken Kaseforth.  Faxes to (612) 713-5151 may be made prior to that deadline, provided that the original signed and dated quote package is also postmarked and mailed first class (or faster) prior to the due date and time listed near the beginning of this paragraph.  Offerors can submit their itemized quotes (i.e., Line Item lump-sum subtotals plus a grand total) using a federal Standard Form 1449, which may be downloaded from ttp://www.forms.gov/ bgfPortal/ citizen.portal.  Regardless of form, all quotes are to be made "firm, fixed price FOB Destination" and are to be signed and dated by offeror's authorized representative. Note that this announcement 301816Q016 must also be incorporated into the quote and subsequent award, either by reference or direct attachment.   (xvii)	Questions about this solicitation should be directed to Contracting Officer Ken Kaseforth at (612) 713-5219.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through February 2006 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-07.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541611 with a small business size standard of $6.0 million.  This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT  be issued.  

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research (OBSSR) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Concept Systems, Inc. (CSI), 401 E. State St #402, Ithaca, NY 14850.  In Phase I, CSI facilitated the translation of surveillance and intervention research evidence so as to promote the adoption of evidence-based community health practices in order to reduce cancer incidence and improve cancer outcomes, particularly for underserved communities whose disproportionate cancer burden make the greatest contribution to cancer-related health disparities.  The Translating Research into Improved Outcomes (TRIO) Initiative has three components: 1) surveillance and modeling, 2) dissemination of evidence-based cancer control interventions, and 3) special partnerships to understand the infrastructure barriers to eliminating cancer-related health disparities in underserved communities.  

In the course of the initiative thus far, OBSSR would like to procure the services of CSI during Phase II.  In Phase II of the TRIO Initiative, CSI would continue to: 1) 
support and contribute to OBSSR’s development of the strategic document and the public presentation of the office’s strategy, 2) develop and manage a time-sensitive and effective process to highlight programmatic, relationship, structural changes that the strategic initiatives indicate, and how the office will implement to enable such changes, and 3) assist OBSSR to develop an easily managed progress assessment approach to support the office’s ongoing refinement of its strategic vision.

It is strongly in OBSSR’s interests to have CSI continue to provide strategic planning stages to ensure that the key priorities identified are on target, translatable to action, and measurable rather than have another company do these tasks.  

CSI is the owner and sole licensor of The Concept System software suite which will provide these specific services.  No other sources or combination of sources provides the features that CSI’s software offers.  

Further awards to any other sources would result in both substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  The period of performance is anticipated to be from the start of the contract through September 30, 2006—a period of five (5) months with option for one (1) successive one-year period.  


Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by May 5, 2006 at 3:00 PM local time will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Normally information received is considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Questions should be directed, via facsimile or email, to Joan Coulter, Business Opportunity Specialist, Office of Acquisition Management, National Library of Medicine, 8600 Rockville Pike, Room B1N17, Bethesda, MD 20894.  Phone: (301) 435-4390; Fax: (301) 402-0642; email: jc224a@nih.gov.


Vendor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.  Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR): htm://www.amet.gov/far/.  The following clauses and provisions shall apply to this acquisition and maybe obtained from the web sites: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items (March 2005); 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items (September 2005); and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items (February 2006).

*******Clarification to Industry (21 April 2006)

1. Do you have any site plans, or digital photos of how this control room mates up with the wind tunnel?

**Answer: Site plans can be found at
http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/
We will be adding information here as necessary and it becomes
available.

As for how the room and tunnel mate up, we don't have any details other
than to indicate that the Wind Tunnel (WT) will penetrate both Control
Room (CR) walls so the walls will need to be installed or built around
the WT duct after the WT is set in place. We anticipate that the
duct-to-wall interface will consist of some type of "L" bracket frame,
sealed to both the interior CR wall and the WT duct. The seal and
attachment interface to the duct CAN NOT penetrate the WT surface so
some type of adhesive/sealant should be used.
----------------------

----------------------
2.  Are you expecting this room to be "stick built" on site, or
pre-fabricated and offloaded from a truck and fit in place? 

**Answer: Due to site constraints, our vision has typically been that the CR would be fabricated on site, but we are open to any suggestions for a pre-fabricated building. This was discussed early on in the project and it was determined that the CR could be set in place over the WT duct with a crane and filler panels installed below the duct. Since that time the CR has grown in size and would not easily be transportable in one piece. A 2-piece design dropped over the WT duct with the bolted and sealed mating surface on the room interior could probably be considered.
We would need to verify this with our Facilities and Planning people.
----------------------

----------------------
3. What controls are expected beyond power that is described? Any motor
starter controls?

**Answer: We anticipate that there will be one or more conduits run from a nearby facilities room where the motor starter, cooling pump, etc. will be installed. These conduits would penetrate the top of the CR side wall nearest the existing building. Wiring and/or conduit can be run above the drop ceiling to the wall between the CR door and where the duct penetrates the CR side wall.

4.  Any control panels and work stations?

**Answer: The WT control panel, computer workstation, instrumentation, data acquisition and controls will be located near the WT duct between the Test Section and the CR side wall with the door.

5. Any lights, sirens, horns, PA systems?

**Answer: Fire alarm lights and sirens are as described in the Solicitation. It is not anticipated that there will be a need for a PA system, although a telephone is specified.
----------------------

----------------------
6.  We have found other materials provide very good acoustical properties inside control rooms. Would you accept something other than gypsum for sound attenuation inside?

**Answer: We are not sure what the actual acoustical environment will be within the CR. We do anticipate that significant sources of noise will be from the fan and motor through the CR wall and within the WT duct, especially when the Test Section side windows are opened. We are not opposed to the perforated wall design but we are a bit concerned about the attenuation of noise through the wall from the motor and fan located in close proximity. We would be open to other ideas.

----------------------

----------------------
7.  If prefab, is the HVAC to be integral to the package, or do you expect a remote mount system?

**Answer: We anticipate the HVAC system to be integral, as there is very limited usable space around the CR. We are also limited to an overall CR height of 10 feet for aesthetic reasons when viewed from the rest of the campus. These constraints leave only the areas between the drop ceiling and the roof and the wall area above and to the side of the WT duct near the door.
----------------------

----------------------
8.  Are you having a pre-bid meeting?

**Answer: We are not anticipating having one.

Because of uncertainties and inevitable changes in the location of vendor carts and other structures along the parking aprons, the contractor must be prepared to modify their setup to the exact area layout established on Friday, 30 June.     All military bases use a variety of frequencies and the contractor must plan on using a diversity system to work around all wireless interference.     If necessary, contractor can submit a list of possible frequencies and Kirtland will approve those that can be used.**NOTE: Area Drawings are available by contacting 2Lt Elizabeth Hastings, Elizabeth.Hastings@Kirtland.af.mil or 505-846-5883, and site visits will be held upon request.**AMENDMENT: Wed, 19 April 2006, 0800 will be the only site visit scheduled.     Please contact Elizabeth Hastings if you would like to attend.     Transportation to Kirtland AFB is at the vendor's expense.* *AMENDMENT:  In addition to Parking Aprons B & C, the triangle from bldg 949 to bldg 1000 to the southwest corner of the area (where the working dog demo will be) must be covered as well. This is to include independent sound system (with lavaliere microphone support) for the working dog area identified by the area diagram. The Thunderbird's PA system will be set up along 3000' at the northern edge of the flight line (at the bottom of the diagram). It is the contractor’s responsibility to interface with their system. Since this is an Air Show in the planning stages, final location of vendors and static displays is still being decided upon as participants are invited and organized. It is the contractor’s responsibility to design enough flexibility into their technical proposal to allow for relatively changeable control/speaker placement and connections.* The Contractor must provide a detailed diagram (electronic or hard-copy) indicating locations of control units, speakers, cabling routes in addition to power requirements.
The contractor must supply a detailed quote listing all equipment and a total amount for the entire event.
The contractor is also responsible for informing Kirtland Base Civil Engineering of equipment needed for installation work (i.e. forklift) and safety equipment needed for the safe operation of the PA system (speaker support, cabling, etc.).
Contact 2Lt Elizabeth Hastings, Elizabeth.Hastings@Kirtland.af.mil or 505-846-5883, for diagram of the air show location: parking aprons B and C.

<DESC>·	Questions and Answers to the combined synopsis/solicitation for FA4608-06-Q-S076  Sharepoint training and implementation
 Answers:
1.  In order for the government to determine pricing fair and reasonable we will need a price breakdown by time and materials to determine how you concluded to your overall price.
#2)  Our Sharepoint site will be used by approximately 600 users
#3)  All of the hardware is in place as well as the software and licenses
#4)  My thoughts were that each training topic would be about 3 days, though I defer to the company to find the best mix of consultation vs. training
#5)  The training is targeted for the Sharepoint site administrators (only 2 people); however, to maximize the value of the training, systems administrators will be attending as well.  
6.  Emailed and faxed responses are acceptable however, please call to verify I received you response in a timely manner.  Sometimes servers are down or fax machines break and the gov't cannot be held responsible for responses not received in a timely manner.

Questions:
1. Is the government looking for one fixed cost for all services or a time and material proposal?
2. How many total users need to be set up on the SharePoint Portal environment?
3. Is the server hardware already in place for the work noted in the solicitation to be performed?
4. Based upon the topics to be covered in the Training, how many days long do you anticipate the training to be?
5. My reading of the solicitation leads me to believe that the Training is targeted towards system administrators, not the SharePoint Portal Content Administrators.  Am I correct in this assumption?
6. Are emailed and/or faxed responses acceptable or do you require paper hard copy in your hands by the 28 April 0900 CsT deadline?
 Questions may be addressed to SSgt Michelle Shows at the above address or call (318) 456-6889.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to cancel the request for quotation in its entirety.  After carefully reviewing the statement of work in light of the questions/requests for clarifications received, we have determined that it is not possible to define the requirement sufficiently to allow for firm fixed price quotes.	Therefore, and in accordance with FAR 12.207, a commercial item purchase is not appropriate for this effort.  The government intends to purchase the required effort via FAR Part 8 procedures.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Background

In December 2000, the U.S. Congress passed legislation establishing the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) in the Library of Congress, under the direction of the Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSI).  The legislation charges the Library to lead a planning effort for the long-term preservation of digital content and to capture current digital content.  In doing so, the Library is to work collaboratively with representatives of other federal, research, non-profit, philanthropic, library and business organizations.  On behalf of the Library, OSI has already entered into collaborative relationships with a number of such “partners” already, using cooperative agreements as the legal vehicle.  OSI is now entering Phase II of the program and is preparing to launch several new sets of cooperative agreements.  It is seeking legal assistance to draft and negotiate the agreements. More information about NDIIPP and the existing partnerships can be found at www.digitalpreservation.gov.

The first program announcement was released in August 2002, and established an initial set of partnerships that assists the Library in selecting, collecting, and archiving valuable digital content for which no analog-equivalent exists.  The Library and partners began to develop a base of experience to deal with at-risk digital content.  The work undertaken not only identified and collected digital content, but also defined the roles and responsibilities and scope of effort among network partners.  The next step is to broaden the network partnerships and to expand the Library’s collaborative efforts into several new areas.  Four separate areas of new investment are being targeted. OSI, on behalf of the Library, intends to enter into approximately four new cooperative agreements under each of the following programs to pursue collaborative arrangements to include the following goals:
1.	Commercial Content Providers Partnership Agreements (a.k.a., “Preserving Creative America”) – The goal is to solve major obstacles that affect the preservation of digital commercial content:
a.	Establish relationships with content owners and/or distributors.
b.	Seek permissions and clear rights for managing content under copyright.
c.	Develop and fulfill collaborative work plans and cost sharing rules for a variety of projects.
d.	Develop joint and/or shared collection responsibilities with other collecting partners in the network throughout the content life cycle.
e.	Use partner relationships to expand the content collecting network.

2.	State Archive Partnership Agreements:  The goal is to create shared multi-state archives for state digital records to collaborate with the private technology sector:
a.	Identify, test, develop, and evaluate tools and technical infrastructure components to support digital preservation and stewardship.
b.	Build or extend collaborative arrangements to explore and share standards, models, and best practices associated with digital preservation.
c.	Establish distributed methods to capture and sustain significant digital information, especially information important to national and state legislative policy makers.  
d.	Share and implement broadly applicable standards, models, and best practices among stakeholders in a distributed digital preservation network. 

3.	Technical Architecture Partnership Agreements: The goal is to form collaborative arrangements to build foundations for a national digital preservation technical infrastructure:
a.	Encourage models for multi-state storage of critical government information for preservation, business continuity, and disaster recovery.
b.	Support projects with concrete, demonstrable results that can be shared among network participants.

In addition, OSI seeks to amend the eight (8) existing Digital Preservation Cooperative Agreements to extend the terms of the agreements and expand the work of the existing partnerships into new areas.

Scope of Work

The Library of Congress seeks expert legal assistance to draft and negotiate the cooperative agreements described above.  Partners will be chosen through a variety of vehicles.  The first task is to utilize the form from the existing cooperative agreements and create a shorter streamlined draft form agreement that can be used for all new cooperative arrangements. The draft form agreement should accommodate the insertion of provisions appropriate to the three programs described above. Individualized draft agreements will be created for each partnership arrangement. Work will include meetings and conference calls with each successful applicant to explain the nature of the Library’s cooperative agreements, and to negotiate the details of the agreement with each prospective partner.  We anticipate approximately twelve (12) new partnerships in addition to eight (8) amendments to existing agreements. The period of performance is April through September 2006.  It is anticipated that negotiated agreements will be completed by September 30, 2006.  Expert legal counsel will work with a small LC team and will include a copyright expert and a contract lawyer from the Library’s Office of General Counsel.  

In addition, the Library seeks assistance to create a not-for-profit foundation, which will accept financial contributions for NDIIPP.

<DESC>The contractor has the responsibility to obtain from its subcontractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill the contractor's obligations to VA (including licensed software, if any) under this Task Order.  If a subcontractor refuses to accept terms affording VA such rights, the contractor must promptly bring such refusal to the attention of the Contracting Officer and not proceed with subcontract award without further authorization. 5.2.3	Proprietary Data.  If for any reason the contractor is unable to complete performance under this Task Order or, if following the completion of this Task Order the contractor ceases to provide support for any software described in this Task Order, the contractor agrees to provide to VA any proprietary software or documentation that is relevant to the work performed under this Task Order.  This provision applies to any data that would be necessary for the maintenance and continued development of any automated information systems, including but not limited to, system source and object codes, supporting system software and all relevant documentation and source listings.  This data shall be provided to VA at no additional cost within thirty (30) calendar days following work stoppage. 5.2.4	Rights in Government Furnished Data and Materials.  VA shall retain all rights and privileges, including those of patent and copy, to all Government furnished data.  The contractor shall neither retain nor reproduce for private or commercial use any data or other materials furnished under this Task Order.  The contractor agrees not to assert any rights at common law or in equity or establish any claim to statutory copyright in such data.  These rights are not exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies to which the Government is otherwise entitled elsewhere in this Task Order. 5.2.5	The Contracting Officer is the sole authorized official to release, verbally or in writing, any data, the draft deliverables, the final deliverables, press releases or any other written or printed materials pertaining to this Task Order.  The contractor shall not release information without prior authorization.  Any request for information relating to this Task Order, and presented to the contractor, will be submitted to the Contracting Officer at least thirty (30) days in advance of the desired release date. 5.3	Government Furnished Property and Facilities:    5.3.1	The Government will provide system access for off-site work in accordance with VA standards, local security regulations and rules of conduct.  The Government will also provide the contractor procedural guides, standards, reference materials and program documentation for use to perform the requirements of this SOW. 5.3.2	In addition, the Government will provide workspace, desktop computers and telephones for two (2) contractor personnel.  Finally, the Government will provide all applicable VA documents and manuals needed by the contractor to perform the work. 5.4	SECURITY 5.4.1	Facility Access and Security:  5.4.1.1	Contractor personnel performing work under this Task Order shall satisfy all requirements for appropriate security eligibility in dealing with access to sensitive information and information systems belonging to or being used on behalf of the VA.   5.4.1.2	The investigative history for contractor personnel working under this contract must be maintained in the databases of either the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO).  Should the contractor use a vendor other than OPM or Defense Security Service (DSS) to conduct investigations, the investigative company must be certified by OPM/DSS to conduct contractor investigations. 5.4.1.3	All costs associated with obtaining clearances for contractor provided personnel will be the responsibility of the contractor.  Further, the contractor will be responsible for the actions of all individuals provided to work for the VA under this Task Order.  In the event that damages arise from work performed by contractor provided personnel, under the auspices of this Task Order, the contractor will be responsible for all resources necessary to remedy the incident. 5.4.1.4	Failure to meet these requirements within a reasonable time period, unless otherwise explicitly specified, will be grounds for suspension or termination of all building and/or computer privileges, and removal from work on the Task Order, until such time as the requirement is fulfilled.   5.4.1.5	Contractor personnel requiring unescorted physical access to VACO will be required to submit personal identifying information (full legal name (first, middle, and last), date of birth, state-issued driver's license or identification card number and the state that issued it, and name as it appears on the card) and may be subject to a criminal history check.  Visitors who are not subjected to the criminal history check may need to be escorted at all times by someone who has been issued a permanent VACO ID badge.  The cost of conducting the criminal history check is the responsibility of the contractor. The contractor shall pre-screen all personnel requiring physical access to the property to ensure they are legally able to work in the U.S. and are not currently sought by law enforcement authorities.  Adjudication of information discovered during or after the criminal history check is solely the responsibility of the Chief, Security Services.  Being admitted entry into the VACO, based on a finding of no criminal history, does not convey any security clearance.  Contractor personnel's physical access privileges may be revoked at any time because of personal misconduct, including any type of safety- or security-related misconduct, criminal conduct, Psychological instability, including illegal use or possession of controlled substances, or financial irresponsibility.   5.4.1.6	If authorized access to VACO, each contractor representative shall have their picture taken and a permanent badge issued.

Contractors must provide signed certification of completion to the COTR during each year of the Task Order.  This requirement is in addition to any other training that may be imposed by the VA.    5.4.1.8	When contractor personnel are on-site at VA SOC Hines, contractor personnel shall follow all established regulations, policies and standard operating procedures applicable to the facility.  Violations of VA regulations and policies may result in the contractor's personnel being removed from the premises and may result in termination of the Task Order for default.  The Government shall not be responsible for any of the contractor's costs for replacement of personnel removed from a VA site for reasons associated with safety, security, and unprofessional or inappropriate conduct.  5.4.1.9	The contractor shall obtain all necessary licenses and/or permits required to perform the work.   5.4.1.10	The contractor shall take all reasonable precautions necessary to protect persons and property from injury or damage during the performance of this Task Order. 5.4.1.11	Failure to complete the work by the required completion date, caused by delays in requesting security clearances, or due to revocation of access privileges resulting solely from the actions of the contractor or their personnel, is not sufficient reason to warrant an extension in the Task Order time or amount. 5.4.1.12	VA reserves the right to order contractor personnel off the VACO site and take other security precautions in the event of an emergency, Government shutdown, times of elevated security risk, or any other reason deemed necessary by VA management or security staff.

These forms can be obtained by the contractor at the following web site: http://vaww.little-rock.med.va.gov/LETC/Background_Investigations.htm. 5.5.5	All costs associated with obtaining clearances for contractor personnel shall be the responsibility of the contractor.  Further, the contractor shall be responsible for the actions of all individuals provided to work for VA under this Task Order.  In the event that damages arise from work performed by contractor provided personnel, under the auspices of this Task Order, the contractor shall be responsible for all resources necessary to remedy the incident. 5.5.6	The contractor, when notified of an unfavorable determination by the Government, shall withdraw the employee from consideration from working under the Task Order. 5.5.7	Failure to comply with the personnel security requirements may result in termination of the Task Order for default. 5.5.8	Upon receipt, the VA Office of Security and Law Enforcement will review the completed forms for accuracy and forward the forms to OPM to conduct the background investigation. 5.5.9	The VA facility will pay for investigations conducted by the OPM in advance.

Any security violations or attempted violations shall be reported to the COTR and VA Information Security Officer as soon as possible.  The Contractor shall follow all applicable VA policies and procedures governing information security, especially those that pertain to certification and accreditation. Evaluation Criteria The objective of this procurement is to choose a single "best value" proposal that provides trade-offs that are advantageous to the Government.  The following evaluation criteria shall be used to evaluate offers in order of descending order of preference: Understanding the requirements The degree to which the Offeror's technical approach reflects a clear understanding of the detail requirements listed in the statement of work and a reasonable, well-thought-out approach that is likely to yield the required results within the required time frame.    Project Management / Professional Staff  The degree to which the Offeror's quote reflects corporate or proposed staff experience identical to, similar to, or related to the requirement.  Past Performance The degree to which past performance evaluations, either included in the quote or identified by the evaluators in any other manner, reflect success in developing systems similar in scope and kind to that listed in the SOW.   Price/Cost The degree to which the proposed cost/price is reasonable, realistic, and competitive.     Understanding the Requirements Project Management / Professional Staff  Past Performance Cost Understanding the Requirements is the most significant criteria of all.  Cost of the Offeror is the least significant factor.  If in evaluating proposals it is determined that an Offeror misrepresented its capabilities, it could be a significant factor in both the evaluation and the contracting officer's responsibility determination. Due Dates All offers must be received no later than 2:00 PM EST, May 8, 2006. Offers must be sent electronically via email to: wendell.atkinson@va.gov.
