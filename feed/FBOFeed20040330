<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the development of one (1) instantaneous acquisition phase shifting speckle interferometer. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase this item from 4D Technology Corporation of Tucson, AZ, on a sole source basis due to the fact that the detail of the design and manufacture of the interferometer are proprietary to 4D Technology Corporation.  The government is not aware of any other companies that meet the technical requirements for this procurement. The 4D Technology Corporation has developed proprietary technology to adapt its PhaseCam dynamic, simultaneous phase interferometer to function as electronic speckle pattern interferometer, which allows instantaneous acquisition of distortion maps in optical support structures both at ambient and cryogenic environment. This renders the interferometer quite resistant to errors from vibration, which are the main limiting factor to the accuracy of interferometric measurements.  The basic PhaseCam technology has already been successfully used for testing of mirrors under vibration-intensive environments.  The adaptation of this technology to function as electronic speckle pattern interferometer will allow these benefits to be applied to the testing of large, lightweight optical support structures and uniquely qualifies them for the development of an electronic speckle pattern interferometer. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 9, 2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for logistical services to conduct common eider banding operations on several islands in the St Lawrence estuary, including transport of materials, purchase of food and supplies and tech salaries.  This announcement constitutes sole source solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued in accordance with note 2. 701814Q026 is issued as a sole source request for quotation. This acquisition and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-19. The following services will be procured from University of Quebec, Service de la Rechen, Montreal, QC Canada. University of Montreal and US Fish and Wildlife Service are partners in the Sea Duck Joint Venture (SDJV), formed under the auspices of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan.  Common eiders breeding in the St Lawrence River estuary are of conservation concern because their populations are depressed and they are subject to hunting in the Atlantic Flyway. Recurrent diseases, high duckling mortality and possible high harvest rates are the most obvious limiting factors but their importance in regulating populations is currently unknown. This study addresses several of the SDJV priorities for common eiders. The following provisions 52.212-1, Instructions to Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial items apply to this acquisition. A completed copy of 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items must be included with the offer. The following clauses 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial items, 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial items applies to this order.  Offers due 2 pm 031504 by fax only at 9077863923. Contact Dennis J. Hermannes by fax only.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center (R&DC) supports the missions of the Coast Guard through research, development, test, and evaluation, to seek performance gap solutions that are based on scientific and technologic advances.  The R&DC maintains contract services to provide for administrative/technical support to project, management, and administrative support activities.  This requirement is a follow-on requirement to an existing directed 8(a)contract. The current contract will run out of ceiling in FY04.  The administrative/technical support requirements cover a broad range of tasks.  They include such areas as informational services, technical writing/editing, creating presentations, position papers and graphics, conference meeting scheduling, logistics and facilitation, library/file management services, Internet/intranet support, office automation, project planning, studies, research, technology investigation and analysis and engineering, scientific, information technology and business support.  In the past, R&DC has allowed Coast Guard Headquarters and other Coast Guard organizations to use the administrative/technical support contract. In March of 2003, the Coast Guard “moved” as an organization from the Department of Transportation to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  That move expands the potential for non-R&DC sources of tasking under this procurement.  It is anticipated that this procurement will result in the award of an Award Term Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) with provisions for placing Time and Material task orders.  Performance requirements will be included as part of the Statement of Work.  It is anticipated that this Award Term contract will be awarded with a base period of performance of three years.  The award term provision will allow the awardee to earn up to seven additional years of term conditioned on contractor performance in accordance with an Award Term Plan.    The contract requirement includes access to classified materials up to the SECRET level. The NAICS code is 541990 and the size standard is 5.0 million.  This procurement is set aside for competition under the Small Business Association’s 8(a) Program.  Proposals will only be accepted from 8(a) companies.  Offers will be evaluated on the basis of best value.  Award will be made to the responsive and responsible 8(a) offeror who provides the greatest overall value to the Government based on the technical proposal, cost and other factors.  For information concerning this solicitation please contact the contracting official cited below.  The USCG Research and Development Center Contracting Office does not issue solicitations in paper form.  Solicitations may be accessed on an electronic posting system at the following website:  http://www.eps.gov.

The FMU-139C/B can also be used with a separate proximity sensor.  The fuze can be initiated by either an external proximity sensor or impact.  A closure ring secures the fuze in the fuze well of warheads.  Prior to operational use it may be stored, transported worldwide, installed in a weapon, loaded on an aircraft, and flown during captive carriage without release.

<DESC>"	The National Park Service, Department of Interior, is soliciting proposals for construction firms having the capability to perform the work described below. This solicitation will be issued electronically, on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, at http://ideasec.nbc.gov   Paper copies of this solicitation will not be made available. Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the National Business Center. Proposal documents will be available in Microsoft Word, HTML and Adobe PDF, Specifications will be available in Adobe PDF format, and drawings will be available in TIFF format. Offerors wishing to receive electronic notification of changes will need to register to receive notification of this specific solicitation at http://ideasec.nbc.gov. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the http://ideasec.nbc.gov site for all information relevant to this solicitation.  THEREFORE, IT IS THE OFFEROR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PERIODICALLY CHECK THE WEBSITE FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION.  No other notifications will be sent. "	Proposed Issue Date: On or about April 15, 2004. "	Title of Project:  Interpretive Center, Administrative Building, Maintenance Facilities, Washita Battlefield National Historic Site, Cheyenne, Oklahoma "	Description:  The work of this contract consists of the construction of a new Visitor's Center, new Administrative Building, new Maintenance Building, new roadwork, parking, site work and landscaping.  All work will be performed under a single contract.  The park will remain open during the course of construction.  The contractor, subcontractors, and delivery vehicles will have to pass through the park entrance station along with visitor traffic in order to gain access to the site.  The Government will remove all salvageable items upon vacating the existing facilities except for those items to be relocated by the Contractor to the temporary facilities. "	Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability to be equally important as an offeror's price, and will then select the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the BEST VALUE to the government, price and technical and other factors considered.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and the use of a trade-off process when it may be in the best interest of the government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  The government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the government to be the most advantageous to the government.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Suburban Hospital, Bethesda MD to extend the existing research collaboration between NHLBI and Suburban Hospital for acute cardiac patients. The purpose of this program is to continue a collaborative research program between the Hospital and NIH to study the use of MRI in the clinical evaluation of acute cardiac patients. Since 1999, NHLBI has been collaborating with Suburban Hospital to develop MRI techniques and apply these methods to patients with acute presentations of ischemic heart disease.  The Hospital will be able to refer >150 hospitalized patients per year for cardiovascular MRI studies. It is believed that Suburban Hospital is the sole source for this program under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the following reasons: Since this requirement aims to continue use of an existing MRI scanner, facility, and office space at Suburban Hospital, the large capital costs of building a new facility at a different location and purchasing a new MRI scanner can be avoided.  In addition, the existing program has developed significant referral networks that would have to be replaced in a new hospital.  Also, since the goal of this program is to evaluate acutely ill patients, the proximity of the Hospital to NIH is critical to permit clinical and engineering staff  to respond to acute patient issues in a timely fashion from the NIH site. The on-call NIH professional staff at the NIH Clinical Center will also provide the specialized clinical coverage for off-hour studies.  The Hospital will be able to provide 24 hour MRI technologist support for the facility.  Based on the clinical requirements of the acute cardiac patient, the hospital shall be located within 5 minutes driving time or 10 minutes by foot from the NIH Bethesda, MD campus. This is to assure that no acute patient will need to wait for proper physician coverage or technical support for a MRI procedure as well as assure a good working relationship between the Hospital and NIH staff.  Thus, Suburban Hospital is a unique environment for the primary reason of the continuation of an existing program.  The period of performance will be for one twelve (12) month period, with options to renew for three additional twelve (12) month periods.  Any competing hospital that believes it is capable of providing the above facility is invited to submit sufficient documentation to demonstrate that capability to the Contract Specialist.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/Glenn Research Center The Intelligent Propulsion Systems Technology (IPSFT) Sub-Project in the Ultra Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) Project Office, Vehicle Systems Program, intends to solicit proposals for research and development in the area of adaptive turbine engine propulsion technologies to enable intelligent turbine engines that significantly reduce harmful emissions while maintaining high performance and increasing reliability. NASA is working to reduce CO2, NOx, aerosols and particulates from the Nation’s airspace, specifically those generated by gas turbine engines used in commercial subsonic and supersonic aircraft. NASA’s current goals are to reduce landing and take-off nitrogen oxides (LTO NOx) by 70% over the 1996 ICAO standard, and to reduce CO2 by 15% from current state-of-the-art large engines, both by 2007.  For planning purposes, NASA’s future goals include increasing these goals to 90% LTO NOx and 30% CO2 reductions.  To achieve this, a new Intelligent Propulsion Systems project will begin in October, 2007, to develop adaptive technologies for modern gas turbine engines to:  1) reduce specific fuel consumption by maintaining optimum performance throughout the engine operating envelope, including transients, 2) greatly reduce engine weight, and hence fuel burn, by reducing design margins, and/or 3) actively control the combustion process to reduce emissions at their source.  In preparation, we are seeking proposals to develop foundation technologies needed for specific adaptive gas turbine engine components.   “Foundation technologies” are low technology readiness level (TRL 1 – 3, inclusive) technologies that enable advanced concepts. For this solicitation, foundation technologies sought include, but are not limited to: sensor systems, actuation systems, control logic, smart materials, morphing structures, fluid mechanics, physics-based models, measurement technologies, electronics, communications, in-situ power generation, and aerodynamics. NASA will award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other agreements to the successful proposers.  NASA will determine the appropriate award instrument.	If contracts are awarded, it will be on a fixed-price basis.  The contract will be a basic one-year period and two one-year options.  Options will be exercised based upon funding and performance considerations. If grants are awarded, research grants will be used. Grants and cooperative agreements will be multiple-year; renewal will be based on funding and performance considerations. Total amount of funding that NASA expects to award through the announcement is approximately $5 million per year for three years, for a total expected funding amount of $15 million. Participation in this NRA is unrestricted.  Teaming is neither encouraged or discouraged. The NASA centers (including Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)) may not serve as lead organizations under this NRA; however, they can participate as part of the research team.  NASA centers (including JPL) can serve as lead organizations for a companion NASA Led Solicitation.

The United States Department of Agriculture participates in the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program; therefore, THIS PROCUREMENT IS RESTRICTED TO EMERGING SMALL BUSINESS.  An emerging small business is a small business concern whose size is no greater than 50 percent of the numerical size standard applicable to the North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS).  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 which has a numerical size standard of $4.0M.

Engineering services are required to perform a breach analysis of the embankments for two dams.  Such analysis will predict the probable inundation extent downstream from the dam in the event of a dam failure.  The analysis will commence at the dam and continue downstream approximately six (6) miles for the Boulder Lake Dam to the confluence of the Boulder Creek and the New Fork River; and approximately six (6) miles for the Toltec Dam to the Esterbrook Road.  The maximum flow rate at the embankment breach shall be computed using criteria in NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) Technical Release No.60, Earth Dams and Reservoirs.  The analysis may use several routing procedures including but not limited to NRCS Technical Release No.66, Simplified Breach Routing, WINTR (Windows NRCS Technical Release) No.20, Hydrology Project Formulation, or HEC-RAS (Hydrology Engineering Center-River Analysis System) 3.11 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  

The government contemplates the award of one Firm Fixed Price type contract resulting from this competition.  

Responses should include proposed sub-consultants for all disciplines including civil, agricultural, environmental, geo-technical, and soil mechanics engineering.  Responses should also include the qualifications of personnel and description of facilities, materials, equipment and services to perform the work described by this notice.  Funding is through the Wetland Rehabilitation Program. 

PRESELETION CRITERIA.  The project manager must be a Licensed Professional Agricultural and/or Civil Engineer in the State of Wyoming and must have direct experience streambank restoration and breach analysis.  Those firms that meet the requirements described and wish to be considered must submit three copies of a form SF 330 or forms SF 254 and SF 255 (the SF 330 is preferred) to Gina Kron, Procurement Specialist, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 100 East B Street, Room 3124, Casper, WY 82601.  The forms must be received in this office no later than 4 PM on April 29, 2004.  The SF 330 (or Forms SF 254 and SF 255) must clearly indicate the office location where the work will be performed and the qualifications of the individuals and subcontractors proposed to work on the contract and their geographical location.  Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection, subject to any limitations indicated with respect to size and geographic location of the firm, specialized technical expertise, or other requirements listed.  

SELECTION CRITERIA.  Selection of firms for negotiation shall be through an order of preference based upon demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required.  All firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following factors which are shown in descending order of importance.  1)  Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.  Professional design capabilities including specialized experience and technical competence including soil mechanics, hydrology, surveying, structural design, and others required.  2)  Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.   3)  Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; 4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; 5) location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project including knowledge of specific natural resource concerns or conditions that affect conservation practice design in that locality; provided, that the application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; and 6) Familiarity with the type or work done by Natural Resources Conservation Service.

<SOLNBR>Q1580040318
<RESPDATE>051504
<ARCHDATE>03302005
<CONTACT>Mark Davidson Contracting Officer 3073442080     mark_davidson@nps.gov;
<DESC>INTRODUCTION Yellowstone National Park requires the services of an archeological firm for data recovery at site 24YE353 and the proposed work is intended to mitigate continuing impacts of erosion by seasonal flooding of the Yellowstone River.  The project area is about five kilometers east of Gardiner, Montana on the Yellowstone River in the northern edge of Yellowstone National Park (hereafter park or Yellowstone). The project is located in the Montana portion of the park on the right (north) bank of the river. ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND Yellowstone National Park is a high mountainous plateau that averages 2400 m in elevation and is within the Middle Rocky Mountains of northwestern Wyoming and adjacent parts of Montana and Idaho.  The Yellowstone Plateau formed through a series of volcanic eruptions and lava flows, with later modification by glaciers.  The volcanic activity in the park is still evidenced by the numerous geysers, hot springs, and mud pots.  Mountains surround the plateau.  The headwaters of the Yellowstone, Madison, and Snake rivers have their origins on this plateau.  Much of the park is covered by conifer forest, although open meadows and grasslands are also present.   Fauna in the vicinity of the site includes the rattlesnake, bullsnake, bear, deer, wolves, bighorn sheep, and coyotes. SITE 24YE353 The site is on the Yellowstone River, four miles from the nearest road in the northern part of the park, and is accessible only by trail.  The crew must camp in the backcountry during the fieldwork, which will take place in July or August 2004.  In August, the site area is often over 90 degrees during the day.  It is important to drink plenty of fluids.  In the backcountry, water is easily available from the river but needs to be filtered. Previous work in 2002 at the site includes a 1x4 m trench about 150 cm deep, a 2x4m block 40 cm deep, and six 1x1 m units taken down to about 40 cm.  A photograph of the 2002 excavation underway was published on p. 27 of American Archaeology magazine (winter 2003-04), Vol. 7, No. 4.  To date, there are seven identified cultural horizons and we are not certain the bottom has been reached in the trench.  The block excavation stopped on a McKean living floor with fire cracked rock features.  four radiocarbon dates from these features averaged 2500 B.C.  The top 30-40 cm were mixed and contained Avonlea and Pelican Lake as well as McKean.  The 4th (middle of 7) horizon at 55-65 cm B.S. has a radiocarbon date of 8710 years B.P.  The three lower levels did not contain diagnostics.  All components contain lithics, fire cracked rock, and fragmented animal bone. Anticipated work would complete the 2x4 m block to sterile deposits with new units as necessary to insure crew safety when working at depth.  One-eighth inch or smaller screen will be used.  The previous 2002 fieldwork has not been written-up and needs to be included in the report that will cover both field seasons.  All artifacts would be catalogued into the National Park Service's rediscovery system.   Technical capability is significantly more important than price.  To be considered, potential contractors must meet education and experience requirements in the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for archeology and Historic Preservation (Federal Register, Sept. 29, 1983, Vol. 48, No. 190).  This education and experience must be documented in the technical proposal.  The fieldwork and report must meet all requirements of the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Officer.  Additionally, potential contractors will be evaluated on the following criteria in descending order of importance:  (1) experience in preparing research questions; (2)  archeological experience in the Rocky Mountains and adjacent Northern Plains; (3) publications and reports on local and regional archeology; (4) proposed methodology, and (5) experience and ability to carryout fieldwork in remote areas, either in Yellowstone National Park or in similar areas that contain bears and wolves.   Due to the time required to obtain a permit, It is also highly recommended that the firm apply for a research permit concurrently with the submission of the proposal.  Permit can be requested via email to Christie_Hendrix@nps.gov.  This solicitation will be available electronically only on or about April 15, 2004.  Questions can be emailed to Mark_Davidson@nps.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Presolicitation Notice   Unrestricted Solicitation (with up to five (5) Unrestricted and up to four (4) HUBZone set-asides) for a total of up to nine (9) Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contra cts (MATOCs) for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Southwestern Division)  for Design-Build Construction, Construction, Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP), Services, and Remediation of real property, to include (but not limited to) planning, designing  and constructing new and/or renovated facilities for military and civilian customers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Southwestern Division and includes Time-and-Materials provisions.  Typical projects include a wide variety of maintenance, repair, re placement, renovation, minor construction (including asbestos and lead base paint abatement), restoration or modernization of a wide variety of facilities, and tasks include (but are not limited to) planning, design and installation/construction of the fol lowing systems:  HVAC, plumbing, electrical, elevators, building envelope, fire protection, AT/FP, or total renovation.  North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Buildin g Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $28.5 Million.  It is the intent of the Fort Worth District to issue one (1) solicitation for award of up to nine (9) contracts (five (5) Unrestricted and four (4) HUBZone ), creating two separate multiple award contractor pools.  The total contract capacity is estimated not to exceed $200 Million over a five-year contract period ($160 Million for Unrestricted and $40 Million for HUBZone).  To preclude the need to re-solicit , if four contracts cannot be awarded to HUBZone firms, the total combined contract capacity of $200 Million will be distributed by one, or a combination of two methods:  1) equally distributed to the five successful Unrestricted contractors, or 2) make an  additional competitive award to a sixth unrestricted contractor.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to four (4) Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of sixty (60) months.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacit y limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with  a record of satisfactory performance.  For estimating purposes only, each of the five (5) Unrestricted Contractors estimated maximum per one-year contract period is $32 Million, and each of the HUBZone Competitive Contractors estimated maximum per one-yea r contract period is $10 Million.  However, each Unrestricted Contractor has the opportunity to receive award amounts up to the estimated Unrestricted total contract capacity of $160 Million.  Likewise, each HUBZone competitive contractor has the opportuni ty to receive awards up to the estimated HUBZone total contract capacity of $40 Million.  The minimum guarantee for each Unrestricted contract will be $10,000.  The minimum guarantee for each HUBZone contract will be $5,000.  The minimum guarantee amount w ill be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.   The minimum task order limitation for both the Unrestricted and HUBZone Competitive contracts will be $2,500.  The maximum t ask order limitation for the Unrestricted and HUBZone Competitive contracts will be $32 Million and $10 Million, respectively.  After award of the basic contrac ts, Unrestricted contractors will not compete with the HUBZone contractors for award of individual task orders.  In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirement, consideration may be given to 1) the complexity of the work ; 2) past performance of the contractor; 3) contract task order limitation; 4) on-going work, 5) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum order limitation.  Estimated s olicitation issue date is on or about April 14, 2004, under solicitation number W9126G-04-R-0013, after the Acquisition Plan has been approved.  Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about May 14, 2004 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).

<CONTACT>Steve Paschke, Senior Business Specialist, Phone 208-526-1113, Fax 208-526-0876, Email sdp@inel.gov
<DESC>This solicitation has been submitted by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory for the Regional Development Alliance (RDA) and Community Reuse Organization (CRO) located in Idaho Falls, Idaho. The Regional Development Alliance, Inc. (RDA) & Community Reuse Organization (CRO) is seeking expressions of interest regarding conversion and operation of a coal fired power plant located on the property of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) located near Idaho Falls, Idaho.  The objective is to convert this facility, which is currently in shutdown, into a commercial power generation plant.  It is also the objective of the CRO that the operator of the power plant makes the facility available to the researchers at the INEEL for test purposes as long as that research does not interfere with commercial operation. 

The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is making the Coal-fired Steam Generating Facility (CFSGF) located at the INEEL available to the CRO.  The CFSGF is located within the boundaries of the INEEL at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC).  The CFSGF was operated from 1983 through 1999 to provide plant steam to the INTEC complex.  The CRO is investigating acquisition of the CFSGF as excess DOE real property and returning the facility to productive regional use.  Successful respondents would be required to modify the facility for electric power production and potentially co-generation, operate the facility primarily as an Independent Power Producer (IPP) and provide a negotiated revenue stream back to the CRO.
  
Current facility specifications are as follow: two (2) Foster Wheeler Atmospheric Fluidized Bed Boilers, 135,000-pounds steam generation per hour capacity, 650 psig operating pressure, bubbling (limestone) bed design, pulsed jet bag house particulate control, Detroit overbed fuel feeders, stoker coal / processed derived fuel / liquid-solid fuel mixture feeds, fuel feed / bottom ash / fly ash boiler sample ports, and railcar or truck fuel receiving and unloading. The facility could generate approximately 15 - 20 MWe (gross) after addition of turbines and any necessary modifications to the boilers. The boiler house has sufficient space to accommodate two additional boilers that could raise the capacity of the facility.  Preliminary investigations suggest that the transmission grid and the existing environmental permits could accommodate a total capacity of up to 50 MWe.  Additional boiler capacity would need to be negotiated with DOE. The facility is fully equipped with a continuous emission monitoring system. Additionally, the facility has a mobile mounted air analyzer for certification of the stack's emission monitoring system that can be modified to meet project-specific requirements.

The capital facilities currently located at the CFSGF site will be transferred to the successful IPP at no cost but with a negotiated continuing royalty on power generated.  Modifications to the facility will be accomplished by the IPP at its own cost.  The IPP will be responsible for removal of the power plant at the end of its useful life. The successful IPP would enter into a Lease and a Site Interface Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Department of Energy. 

Companies interested in evaluation of this opportunity should submit an expression of interest to the address listed below.  Included with that expression of interest should be a brief financial summary of the submitting entity in sufficient detail to assure the CRO that the submitting entity can fulfill its potential obligations.  The submittals should be made within forty-five (45) days from the issue date of this RFI to the attention of Mr. Tim Solomon at the following address.  Notification of the selection process will be made to successful candidates within thirty (30) days.  Upon notification of selection the candidates will be given the opportunity to make a complete inspection of the property and will be asked to make a formal proposal on the conversion and operation.

However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against MMS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the MMS use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirements.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this RFI.  NOTE: At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern.  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY: The proposed study will make precise measurements regarding oil evaporation, spreading, and other behavior in and on ice and snow as functions of physical conditions and oil properties. The work may be done in any combination of small scale (cold room) laboratory, basin, or as experimental spills in sea ice or snow.  Both high and low pour-point crudes will be tested. However, it is important to have some knowledge about the oil properties before performing any field studies and results from the field should also be reproduced in the laboratory when the field work is completed.  Economies of scale should be used to test a larger suite of oils in laboratory experiments.  Both high (ca. zero degrees C) and low pour point crudes should be used.  Cold room facilities capable of oil evaporation research at -40 degrees C are required.  Oil-in-snow-and-ice tasks will include quantitative measurements of spreading, stripping velocity, equilibrium thickness, evaporation, migration rates through brine channels, and related chemical composition and physical conditions.  The experimental data in concert with other oil-ice weathering data will be used to validate and enhance or develop new algorithms of oil weathering in ice and snow.  Publication of findings in peer reviewed scientific literature is essential.  Descriptions of other Alaska OCS Region studies previously conducted by MMS can be found at: http://www.mms.gov/alaska/ess/index.htm.  SOURCES SOUGHT: Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 20 pages that details the small business firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  In order to compete for these requirements, interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by detailing: (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the tasks with their qualifications, their specific experience, and publication record in peer reviewed scientific journals; (2) your facilities (laboratory, cold room, and other facilities and instruments necessary to accomplish the tasks); (3) your organizational experience; and (4) specific references (including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number & E-mail address) for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last four years (references will be checked).  If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. RESPONSES ARE DUE no later than COB pm Eastern Time on April 19, 2004.  Interested parties shall submit their Capabilities Statements in original and one (1) copy to Sharon Teger, Contract Specialist, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2500, Herndon, VA 20170-4817. Two (2) additional copies shall be sent to Richard Prentki, Ph.D., Minerals Management Service, Alaska OCS Region, 949 E. 36th Avenue, Anchorage, AK 99508. Timeliness of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon VA. Questions should be faxed as soon as possible to Sharon Teger at Fax (703) 787-1022. Please include your full name, the RFI number (1435-01-04-RP-34501) and title (Empirical Weathering Properties of Oil in Snow and Ice), your organization, complete address, and phone and fax numbers. TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

Description
This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal but a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support (the Solid Phased Array Radar Systems SSPARS, AN/FPS-120 and 123 Radar Systems). The draft solicitation, when issued on or about 15 Nov 2004, will be a Request for Proposal (RFP) with a draft statement of work (SOW). A best value source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection. The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hours-a-day,       7 days-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group. The contractor shall be responsible for the Sea Launch Ballistic Missile Warning System (SLBMWS) and Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) at the following locations; Cape Cod AS, MA (SLBMWS), Beale AFB, CA (SLBMWS 2), Thule AB, GL (BMEWS Site 1), Clear AS, AK (BMEWS Site II) and RAF Fylingdales UK (BMEWS Site III).  The mission for SSPARS provides early warning and attack assessment of a sea-launched ballistic missile, and/or medium range ballistic missile attack against the Continental United States (CONUS) and Southern Canada.  The secondary mission is to provide space surveillance, tracking and reporting of Earth orbiting satellite vehicles. The subsequent contract will include a projected sixty-day phase-in period (30 Jul 2006-30 Sep 2006). It is anticipated that the contract performance period could be greater than 7 years.  The contract type has not been determined but the current contract type is  (FPIF/AF). The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is currently 517910. We anticipate that this will be a full and open competition. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement. All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.eps.gov. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.

<DESC>This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources interested in performing a pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis) inventory in sagebrush habitats of eastern Oregon for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Inventory will involve following transect lines through tall and dense sagebrush habitats on foot or on horseback to locate pygmy rabbit burrows, small rabbit pellets and visual identification of the rabbits themselves.  Inventory area will cover approximately 60,000 acres in two areas of eastern Oregon (approximately 30,000 acres each).  The first area is centered in the vicinity of Wagontire, OR which is located 45 miles southwest of Burns, OR.  The second area is in the vicinity of Sourdough Mountain, located 30 miles southwest of Vale, OR.  Inventory units will vary in size from 50 to 1000 acres and will be scattered over several townships.  Transects shall be approximately 0.25 miles apart, distributed across potential habitats.  Estimated start work date is July 2004.   PROJECT FUNDING: Due to the nature of the federal funding available for this project, the firm conducting the inventory must provide a 1:1 match of the federal funds.  The BLM will pay the contractor half the contract price for the contract.  The firm's matching contribution may be cash, in-kind services or use of equipment or vehicles provided directly by the contractor or a third party, as long as the contribution is not federally-derived.  The estimated total dollar range for this project is $100,000 to $200,000. INTERESTED PARTIES: Interested parties may submit their name, contact information and a brief resume covering experience in inventorying pygmy rabbits and knowledge of this species to any of the following:  via email to or952mb@or.blm.gov, via fax to 503-808-6312 or mail to Bureau of Land Management, Branch of Procurement Management (OR952), PO Box 2965, Portland, OR 97208 or handcarried or express package to Bureau of Land Management, Branch of Procurement Management (OR952), 333 SW First Ave., First Floor, Portland, OR, 97204.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) wishes to identify potential sources to provide services to research and determine what construction issues may arise in the use of a cementitious group in the entombment of a nuclear concrete structure.*****The Government anticipates that capable vendors/parties will possess the following technical expertise: (i) previous expertise/experience in the construction and use of cementitious grouts in the entombment of a large-scale nuclear concrete structure; (ii) previous expertise/experience in materials selection for cementitious grouts to be used in the entombment of a large-scale nuclear concrete structure; (iii) previous experience in reporting results obtained; and (iv) previous experience in collaborating with scientific personnel within a federal research agency.*****THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE  IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IN NO WAY COMMITS THE GOVERNMENT.** This is not a solicitation for proposals, nor will a contract/order be awarded in response to this notice.** Costs associated with vendors’ providing information in response to this announcement and any additional requests for information and/or materials will NOT be reimbursed.*****Interested, capable vendors/parties shall submit a capability statement in response to this Sources Sought Notice, including, at a minimum, the following: * (a) Technical discussion of vendor’s ability to perform the draft Statement of Work (which follows); (b) Name of Company-include a contact person's name, telephone number, and email address; (c) Company Address; (d) Company Size (please specify as either-Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), or Hubzone Small Business); (e) Identify whether you are interested in this acquisition as a prime contractor or a subcontractor; (f) Identify whether the services identified in the Draft Statement of  Work (which follows) are of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace based on established catalog or market prices and whether these services are exclusively provided to the Government; (g) Identify standard commercial terms and conditions typically associated with these services; (h) Describe experience and past performance with similar types of requirements of similar scope and magnitude and whether they were performance-based (with contract number, Government agency name and address and contract funded amount; (i) Identify existing or potential pricing structure in support of this type of work; (j) Identify qualifications of technical and management personnel; and (k) Identify and clearly mark any proprietary processes or data.***DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK: Introduction- Entombment may be considered as an option for decommissioning nuclear concrete structures so that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) may issue termination licenses for facilities on which these structures reside. Prior to entombment, the nuclear facility permanently ceases operations and spent fuel is removed. After preliminary decommissioning activities are completed, some radioactively contaminated components would be left in an existing structure on the site. The radioactive materials are then entombed with an engineered barrier system that could include filling the structure with a grout or infill. In the process, various construction issues must be addressed to assure the desired facility performance. The NRC has asked NIST to coordinate a preliminary overview of the needs specific to cementitious grouts. Cementitious grouts are a viable candidate for entombment because they may provide both a physical and a chemical barrier to radionuclide transport. The difficulties in using cementitious grouts are the potential materials selection, material properties, and constructability issues that might arise. Depending upon the entombment scenario, the design
may require the grout to completely fill all the available space. To achieve this, the grout must have certain rheological properties that will likely require adding chemical admixtures
that may interfere with other grout properties. In addition, other desirable material properties might require increased cement contents. Unfortunately, increasing the cement content
can lead to heat production issues that may affect overall constructibility.  Moreover, although each of these issues has been addressed individually, achieving all these requirements
simultaneously will require careful materials selection and proportioning.  This work will be performed as part of a larger project that includes NIST personnel and other contractors. Other groups will be working on separate issues regarding the use of grouts: rheology, radionuclide leaching, modeling and testing. Although separate tasks, each must be performed in collaboration with others working on the project. Purpose and Objectives- The primary purpose of the overall project is the creation of guidelines for materials selection and use of cementitious grouts. This subcontract shall address all the following topics as they relate to this purpose: Materials Selection: proportioning guidelines and testing protocols. Cement Interactions: radionuclides and heavy metal. Material Properties: diffusivity, permeability, pH, and Eh. 1 Constructibility: placement, setting characteristics, curing, heat production and dissipation, volume changes, and monitoring. Design Criteria: design life, structural integrity, long-term warnings. Relevant Projects: examples and summaries.  Work Requirement- Task 1: Analysis, and Summary: The contractor shall enumerate and describe in detail construction issues that may arise in
the use of a cementitious grout in the entombment of a nuclear concrete structure. These issues, listed in the Purpose and Objectives section, include, but are not limited to, materials
selection, mixing, transport, heat production, and mechanical stability. These issues shall be addressed in the context of achieving an overall entombment design goal. (The issue of
grout rheology will be addressed by NIST personnel.)  The contractor shall discuss relevant construction projects that have employed cementitious grouts in the entombment of nuclear concrete structures. The contractor shall discuss the most advanced field knowledge on the selection of materials for the grouts. The materials considered shall include both supplemental pozzolanic materials and chemical admixtures. The contractor shall discuss available tools and guidelines for the selection of these materials.  Task 2: Reporting Results- The contractor shall summarize the findings in Task 1 into a report that will be incorporated into the final report. The contractor is expected to collaborate on the final document assembly. 2 Travel-
NIST will pay travel expenses for contractor travel to NIST for periodic meetings with the entire project staff, in accordance with Government-allowable rates and prior approval by the Technical Contact and the Contracting Officer.  The contractor shall budget for anticipated travel expenses to one nuclear facility, at a location not determined, within the continental United States. NIST will accept travel cost invoices for pre-approved travel at allowable rates, on a as needed basis. Deliverables: extended outline for final report; final report.  Expected Effort-NIST expects the total effort for Task 1 and Task 2 combined to be less than 2 man-months. Timetable-The contractor shall complete Task 2 prior to Aug 1, 2004.*****Vendors/parties shall submit response, to National Institute of Standards and Technology, ATTN Tamara Grinspon, Acquisition and Logistics Division/Contracts, 100 Bureau Drive—STOP 3571, Gaithersburg, MD  20899-3571, via email (tamara.grinspon@nist.gov )AND facsimile (FAX: (301) 975-6273) on or before 3:00PM EST, April 5, 2004.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) wishes to identify potential sources to provide services to research and develop a fundamental theoretical model for prediction of the compressive strength of cement-based materials, such as cement paste, mortar and concrete, from the multi-phase, multi-scale microstructure.*****The Government anticipates that capable vendors/parties will possess the following technical expertise: (i) be a world-class mechanician; (ii) be a concrete microstructure expert; (iii) be a multi-scale mechanical theorist.

The VCCTL industrial consortium consists of nine companies, including leading cement, chemical admixtures, and aggregate companies. The set of models, embodied in software, will have reached version 4.0 at the end of calendar year 2003. One of the most important properties of concrete is the compressive strength. To be able to properly predict this property from fundamental knowledge of materials and the multi-scale microstructure of concrete is crucial to the success of the consortium. The theory to do this has not been carried out, at present, and needs to be done. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE WORK:  Research is needed to develop a theoretical model that predicts the strength properties of a cement paste based on the intrinsic strength properties of the phases in cement-based materials (measured by nanoindentation), and the digital microstructure of the material (which is already available at NIST).  The result is expected to improve current prediction models of the cement paste strength. This theoretical model will also predict the strength properties of mortar and concrete based on the strength properties of the cement paste, and the strength properties of aggregates and eventually of the Interfacial Transition Zone. Publication of results in the open literature is strongly encouraged.  CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS: The focus of the proposed research is the prediction of strength properties of cement-based materials: cement paste, mortar and concrete. The following tasks should be completed: Task 1 Cement paste: The first task will be devoted to cement paste, composed of a C-S-H matrix, Portlandite crystals, micro-porosity and other relevant solid material components. This microstructure is available in NIST’s Virtual Cement and Concrete Testing Laboratory, and is currently in use for finite element predictions of the elastic properties. The same geometrical representation of the microstructure will be used as a starting point for the implementation of yield design limit theorems, which will be implemented as a minimization problem of the maximum dissipation capacity: (a) The different phases in the cement paste will be assumed to obey a Mohr-Coulomb friction material, characterized by the cohesion and the friction angle. These values are currently under investigation at MIT by means of nanoindentation of C-S-H and Portlandite, and will be made available for model testing. (b) In the upper bound limit analysis approach, kinematically admissible velocity fields at failure will replace the displacement field currently used in the finite element analysis. These velocity fields will serve (1) to calculate the dissipation capacity in the heterogeneous material system as a sum of the dissipation in the bulk material and along interfaces, and (2) the dissipation associated with the compressive force applied to the material at failure. Yield design states that the second is always smaller than or equal to the first. This requires minimizing the first quantity (very similar to finite element analysis) to come the closest to the actual failure load (and associated macroscopic strength). It will be necessary to adapt this computational environment to the 3-D geometrical representation (mesh) of the microstructure developed at NIST.  Task 2- Validation of cement paste approach: To validate the approach of Task 1, the contractor will compute both the elastic properties and the compressive strength of digitized material samples of NIST, and compare the results with empirical formulas (such as the ACI formulas) that were fitted on the basis of a large experimental data base. This will allow not only validation of the approach, but will contribute to the physics background of these empirical relations. Ultimately, it should then be possible to determine, purely numerically, the fitting coefficient for a certain range of concrete materials.  Task 3 Extension to mortar and concrete -Contractor will explain how the ideas developed in Tasks 1 and 2 for cement paste could be extended to mortar and concrete, using the concept of the Interfacial Transition Zone.  Deliverables: A monthly progress report shall be submitted to NIST.  The work shall be completed with a final report delivered 12 months from date of award. GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS:  NIST will provide the contractor with digital images of model concrete microstructure as needed to develop the research. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: The results of the multi-scale model analysis will be reviewed by NIST Technical Contact for completeness. The written final report will be approved and accepted based on thoroughness in describing the multi-scale strength model and the method to predict strength, along adequate documentation.*****Vendors/parties shall submit response to: National Institute of Standards and Technology, ATTN Tamara Grinspon, Acquisition and Logistics Division/Contracts, 100 Bureau Drive—STOP 3571, Gaithersburg, MD  20899-3571, via email (tamara.grinspon@nist.gov ) AND facsimile (FAX: (301) 975-6273), on or before 3:00PM EST, April 5, 2004.

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is seeking to sign a Letter of Agreement (LOA) to work with an aerial lift manufacturer to conduct applied research on aerial lift safety. The goal of this project is to improve the safety of aerial lift operators and ground personnel by conducting applied research on the mechanisms of fall/collapse/tipover incidents related to this equipment while in operation.  This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner selected will share in the research and engineering findings with NIOSH researchers 

Between 1992-99, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics identified 341 deaths in construction related to the use of personnel lifts. An investigation of occupational aerial lift fatalities (McCann, 2003) showed that aerial lift operators are at risk of falls from elevation from tip-over events and from other failure modes related to the operation of this equipment. Tipovers of scissor lifts involved 30% of vertical lift deaths, mostly while the lifts were elevated at least 15 feet; hitting a hole or driving over the edge of elevation changes accounted for one-quarter of tipovers.

The project is currently in the study protocol phase.  NIOSH has conducted a surveillance study of fatal and nonfatal injuries related to the operation of aerial lifts, and is about to move into a second phase of the study, which will focus on engineering analysis of various factors such as the center of mass and loading conditions of aerial lifts, and the design of safety features that will affect operator safety. Prior to finalization of the research protocol, NIOSH wishes to solicit input from industry partners on the overall focus and direction of the research, so as to incorporate expert counsel from manufacturers of this equipment, as to the leading causes of injury-producing events, and most effective safety controls that can be incorporated into equipment design. 

Candidate companies which appear to possess the greatest capacity to meet the requirements listed below, will be evaluated based on their capability to successfully perform the following tasks: Perform engineering analysis of aerial lift components and systems, as well as perform modeling, simulation, design and associated research and engineering tasks needed to assess and modify design and operational characteristics of aerial lift equipment. This announcement does not obligate NIOSH to sign an LOA with any presented company.  NIOSH reserves the right to establish a partnership based on engineering analysis/evaluation capabilities found under this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the government. 

Collaborative Capabilities Parameters: (Companies should try to meet as many of these requirements as possible, but highly innovative solutions without testing are not discouraged from presentation or response.) 

(A) Providing significant engineering and technical expertise in manufacturing aerial lift equipment or safety control equipment for aerial lifts.   - Required; 

(B) Fabricating prototypes incorporating enhanced safety features or safety control equipment for test and evaluation - Required; 

(C) Providing expertise to NIOSH in designing and conducting field evaluations  - Required; 

(D) Reviewing test results and recommending design modifications; 

(E) Reviewing testing methods and recommending appropriate, new testing criteria. 

NIOSH is seeking an innovative partner to address these safety issues.  A company that is qualified and currently manufacturing or fabricating aerial lifts or safety control devices for aerial lifts is highly desired.  However, past testing and design of similar equipment is not required.  If prior testing has been performed the test information and results should be provided.  Interested parties responding to this request should provide detailed information regarding capabilities, test results, and cost data.  Presentation material may consist of literature, electronic presentation, or video. (Samples and data provided to the government as part of this solicitation will not be returned to vendors following the completion of this project.)  Vendors may be offered the opportunity to meet with representatives of the project team following a review of all submitted data. Data and/or product samples must be delivered to NIOSH by May 7, 2004  Although every effort will be made to consider all information received, the government will not be obligated to evaluate information received after May 7, 2004.  Vendors should note any proprietary data as such. If any data is to be excluded from exchange with any of the project participants, a statement of that fact shall be included with the statement of propriety.  Presentations from interested vendors are optional but encouraged. The government has identified  May 26 & 27, 2004, for these presentations to be conducted.  The Government reserves the right to identify an alternate meeting date if those identified are not viable for one or more interested vendors.

<SUBJECT>A -- J-UCAS COMMON OPERATING SYSTEM INDUSTRY DAY
<DESC>The DARPA Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) Office is hosting an Industry Day on April 20, 2004.  This forum will present an overview of a proposed consortium business arrangement for the development of the J-UCAS ?Common Operating System? (COS) and specifically a solicitation for the role of integrator/broker.  J-UCAS Overview:  The Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program is a joint DARPA/Air Force/Navy effort to demonstrate the technical feasibility, military utility and operational value for a networked system of high performance, weaponized unmanned air vehicles to effectively and affordably prosecute 21st century combat missions, including Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), surveillance, and precision strike within the emerging global command and control architecture. The J-UCAS office is currently managing two air vehicle development programs, the X-45 (Boeing), and the X-47 (Northrop Grumman).  The newest piece to the J-UCAS program structure is the Common Systems and Technologies (CST) organization.  CST is responsible for all aspects of the system that reach beyond the individual platforms.  Common Systems & Technologies Overview:  The J-UCAS CST organization?s primary charter is to develop a Common Operating System to facilitate the integration of subsystems such as sensors, weapons, and communications.  The COS is the software and the algorithms that provide for command and control, communications management, mission planning, much of the interactive autonomy, the human systems interface and the many other qualities associated with each of these.  In addition, CST will develop a system architecture to ensure intra-operability between the internal components of J-UCAS and inter-operability with external elements such as manned aircraft, command and control centers, and space assets.  Furthermore, CST will develop a single suite of sensors accompanied by common mission avionics, and software applications.  Proposed Consortium Overview:  In order to accomplish the development of the COS, the J-UCAS program office is seeking to foster a new business agreement.  This proposed agreement will form a consortium among the program primes (Boeing and Northrop Grumman), technology contributors, and an integrator/broker.  Program primes are key stakeholders that directly contribute software functionality to the COS and are exclusively responsible for integrating the COS onto their own platform.  Technology contributors provide ?best of breed? algorithms to the COS.  Their involvement in the consortium is based on the specific potential contributions that may enhance the COS functionality.  Technology providers can include small developers, other large defense contractors, as well as traditional sub-contractors.  The integrator/broker role is intended to facilitate the COS integration process among the other potential consortium members.  The integrator/broker is not envisioned to be a large scale integrator or a Lead System Integrator (LSI), and can have no other role in the consortium.  Integrator/broker Overview:  A solicitation for the integrator/broker role will be released on or about 1 May 2004.  A successful offeror in this role would consist of either a single organization or a teaming of organizations that are capable of the following:  Acting as an honest broker within the consortium; Facilitating, coordinating, and (if necessary) completing the development of the J-UCAS enterprise architecture; Facilitating, coordinating, and (if necessary) completing development and integration of the COS; Developing and maintaining an executable J-UCAS architectural model; Providing available infrastructure to support technology identification and evaluation (e.g., Simulation, labs, etc.); Maintaining configuration control of Interface Control Documents (ICDs), executable models, and COS releases; Exhibiting domain knowledge expertise in the areas of sensors, communications, and real-time embedded systems; Applying their experience from developing and integrating large-scale, complex systems to support J-UCAS Common Operating System technical activities.  The COS Industry Day will take place at the Executive Conference Center, Sixth Floor, One Virginia Square, 3601 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA.  Attendance is limited to two (2) representatives per company.  Registration for the Industry Day can be made on-line at http://www.eventmakeronline.com/j-ucas/industryday/index.asp.  A $35 registration fee will be required.  On or about 12 Apr 04, the CST will post a draft copy of the Statement of Objectives associated with the COS effort.  Please visit the following URL for that information:  http://www.darpa.mil/baa/.  Technical questions can be directed to Marc Pitarys, COS Program Manager, at mpitarys@darpa.mil.  Business questions can be directed to Mark Bennington, J-UCAS Agreements Officer at mbennington@darpa.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- IRIA 2-Month Extension
<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) plans to award a sole source modification for a two-month extension to Veridan Systems Division, Inc. (Veridan) in support of the Infrared Information Analysis Center (IRIA) under contract SPO900-96-D-0080. Veridan is the only source to provide IRIA services within the required timeframe. This action represents a bridge extension until a competitive follow-on acquisition is awarded. Veridan has the operational capability in place for continuous DoD-wide demand for technical support in the area of Infrared Technology. Award to any other source would require transition and start-up time that would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling ongoing critical agency requirements. This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and should not be a request for competitive proposals. The determination of the Government not to open subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304 ©(1).

<DESC>Holloman AFB seeks proposals for a flashover fire training unit with educational program. The contractor is to furnish all labor, parts, facilities, and transportation necessary to deliver and install the unit at Holloman AFB, NM, and conduct training in its operation, maintenance, and use. Holloman will purchase the system based on a best value determination. Selection criteria and factors follow. 
   The unit is to be equal to that manufactured by Flashover Systems Inc., of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and all submissions must be accompanied by technical specifications regarding selection factors 1, 2, and 4. Selection of best value will be made by comparing submitted (and documented) technical specifications to those of the unit specified as the standard for selection factors 1 and 2. Any technical specification pertaining to Safety or Durability not matching or exceeding those of the standard will automatically disqualify the proposed unit. Selection factor 3 will be judged by the customer (Holloman AFB Fire Department) based on their professional experience and expertise, and is necessarily a subjective comparison. Selection factor 4 is part of the basic requirement of this solicitation. If it is quoted as an accessory or extra cost, the submitted unit will be disqualified. This does not, however, preclude itemizing of the various items of the proposal. Selection factors 5 and 6 will be used as a last resort in the event of a tie among submitted units.
   Selection factors, in descending order of importance, are:
1.	Safety Compliance – at minimum, NFPA standards 1001, 1403, 1500, and OSHA standards 1910.23, and 1910.134.
2.	Durability – the unit should be reasonably expected to last 10 years, assuming usage is not excessive and a regular periodic maintenance program with minor touch up painting. A warranty will suffice as documentation for this factor.
3.	Ease of operation and maintenance – primarily a subjective judgment. See above.
4.	Training program – standard with the unit. Content and methodology are required documentation for this factor.
5.	Stationary unit – preferred, but trailer-mounted is acceptable.
6.	Price – absolutely the least important factor.

<DESC>The US Army Special Operations Command, Fort Bragg North Carolina has a requirement to provide a Language Training Program Analysis and Long-Range Surveying Device for the Special Operations Forces Language Office at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials and transportation unless stated in the specifications.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. All quotes shall reference the Request for Quotation number H92239-04-R-0002. Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2001-20. It is the Contractor's responsibility to be familiar with all applicable clauses and provisions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990. The size standard is $6,000,000. This requirement is a total 100% set-aside for small business.  A firm fixed price contract will be issued with a base period and four option periods. A Pre-proposal Conference is scheduled for Thursday, 8 April 2004, 1:00 p.m., HQ USASOC, Bldg E-2929, DCSRM Conference Room 252, Fort Bragg, NC. The contractor shall provide the following:  All personnel and services necessary to conduct the survey program of research analysis of the current Special Operations Forces (SOF) language training programs.  Ensure that SOF personnel receive effective language training to achieve the language skill levels necessary to effectively meet the requirements of their missions.  Design an integrated program which means a program that addresses all needs start to finish to provide SOF personnel effective language training.  This would integrate initial, sustainment, and enhancement training for all flavors of SOF (Army/Navy/AF) and all components (AC/RC).  Currently some SOF receive institutional training in their qualification courses and then sustainment and enhancement training at the unit.  Most SOF get 100% of their training at the unit.  So, the integrated program would take into account all other (non-language) SOF training requirements and propose a solution that is integrated both in terms of initial, sustainment and enhancement language training and in terms of the qualification and at unit training that SOF go through. The contractor shall provide a survey process that will utilize commonly accepted industry methodologies and practices to conduct the survey, which will analyze, but not be limited to, such factors as initial acquisition, sustainment and enhancement language training programs throughout the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  As a minimum, the process will assess available historical data; the relationship between service member Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) and their subsequent language proficiency; instructor qualifications and training materials; instructional methodologies; a longitudinal study of factors effecting skills retention; utility of computer-based and Distributive Learning in language training; and initial acquisition training at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (JFKSWCS).  Results:  This work will create a systemic approach and data to aid in military decision making on the following:  a) best methodology for efficient and cost effective conduct of SOF Foreign Language acquisition and sustainment training, b) best way to select individuals for specific language to be taught, c) metrics required to effectively monitor and adjust training programs.  Note: all assertions/conclusions must be supported.

Projects:  (there may be separate projects, a single project or several-the vendor may determine that certain SOF can be "lumped" together:  Provide empirically based research that documents the effectiveness of existing and new techniques for providing initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement language training.  The research will analyze the total cost (instructors, materials, overhead, travel, training time, training development, etc.) of initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement language training used by USSOCOM.   This training is done through military institutions, unit language labs, academic institutions, distributed learning, one-on-one tutoring, and a host of other methods.   This information will then be used to compare results in terms of Defense Language Proficiency Tests (DLPT) scores, training time, DLAB scores and target scores.  All training methods and types considered must be feasible (e.g. very few SOF personnel can or will attend 4 hours of class after their normal duty day to acquire a new language).  We also need recommendations on what metrics are needed and when/where they should be measured.  Specifically, the final product should address the following:  1.What is (are) the most cost effective initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement language training method(s) or type(s) for RC Army SF?  AC Army SF? AC Navy SOF?  AC Air Force SOF?  RC Army CA?  AC Army CA?  RC Army PSYOP?  AC Army PSYOP?  The contractor shall provide a Statement of Work and a DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List with their proposal.  The contractor shall include their management and technical approach in achieving the objectives; an explanation of the labor mix proposed, as well explain their material and travel line. Standard two (2) page Resumes are required and will be reviewed along with cost proposals.

<DESC>Amendment 0001:  Questions and Answers: 1.What is the expected number of users and installation plan for those users? For example, total of 300 users with first 50 in the first quarter after installation, next hundred in the 2nd quarter, etc.  A - Initially, the expected number of users will be between 25-35 for a 12 month period.  2. What is the recommended/approved data source for 10K, 10Q, etc. reports: SEC's own database, Compustat, Edgar-Online. Are there any preferences?  A - No preferences.  We expect that the offeror will make a decision on what is the most complete data source in developing its proposal.  3. Where can one obtain "Historic coverage of data related to accounting and audit reports for publicly traded companies. " Any preferred source?  A - This data is present in the filings on EDGAR.  There is nothing beyond the reports that are part of a registrant’s filings.   We would also expect vendor to have developed sources to enhance the product. 4. Evaluation against what objectives with respect to the following statement in the solicitation "Evaluation of a company’s present and past financial data"  A  This is intended to describe a trend analysis (i.e., year-over-year comparisons of balances, ratios, metrics, etc.)  5. Since details of accounting opinions and accounting reports are not disclosed in public except based on SEC's request, is the expectation that this information will be available to SEC from the companies  A There is nothing beyond the reports that are part of a registrant’s filings.  6. Is this sentence referring to XBRL: "especially at a point where there are data content tags for the reports filed with the Commission" in section C.4  A - Not necessarily XBRL.  Most certainly XML in some form.  7. What are the expected integration requirements across tools, platforms, and technologies listed in C.4.1  A - We would expect that output from this product or service would interface with Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word, or is compatible with Sybase or Microsoft Access databases. While intermediate load files would suffice, direct interface capabilities are desirable. Other possible integration alternatives include SAS or Business Objects.  8.  What type of integration is required with PVCS Tracker and PVCS Version Manager? These tools are typically used for source code management in software development. Does SEC use it in a different way? For example to manage the audit process?  A - There is no specific integration requirement with PVCS.  9. If PVCS is used for software development, then is the expectation that SEC wants source code to the system offered to SEC?  A – No  10. Can SEC provide an enterprise architecture diagram to show how the computers, application servers, and other systems described in the solicitation are deployed and used in day-to-day work at SEC?  A – No  11. Is the SEC-Washington, DC interested in acquiring these types of investigative services as an agency?  A -  This requirement is agency-wide. 12. Is this a service that a company can provide on a case-by-case basis in a no bid program either to NY or the agency?  If so, what is the maximum amount of the contract that can be awarded on that basis.  A - As stated in the Combination Solicitation/Synopsis SECHQ1-04-Q-0028 this contract action may result in multiple awards, or one single award.  SEC is unable to predict the number of multiple awards or the likelihood of one single award at this time.  13. If you desire these services and they must go out for bid, what is the exact procedure you required for us to submit a formal proposal for consideration?  A - - As stated in the Combination Solicitation/Synopsis SECHQ1-04-Q-0028, please refer to FAR 52.212-1 and FAR 52.212-2 for information concerning response to this notice.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) may be accessed at http://www.acqnet.gov/  14.  First, I would just like to confirm that this opportunity is in fact, a new requirement and that there are no incumbents. A - This is a new requirement.  15.  Second, is it at all possible to inquire about the maximum possible awarded value of this contract; that is the total funding available?  A - The total estimated dollar amount will vary based on the number and types of contracts awarded.  16. An initial question that I had was whether or not there is a web site where previous commercial offers to SEC RFQs have been posted as examples or as part of the bid process.  A - No  17.  Also, do you recommend using the SF1449 letterhead stationery as apposed to a company's personalized letterhead when submitting the offer?  A - SEC has no requirement as to what type of stationary is used.  The  SF1449 is not being used for this requirement per FAR 12.603 (b).          This synopsis/solicitation is for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.603, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement requests a detailed capabilities statement (technical quote) in addition to a price quote and constitutes the only solicitation; a paper solicitation will not be issued. Request for Quotation number SECHQ1-04-Q-0028 shall be referenced on any capabilities statement (technical quote) and price quote.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC-20 for full and open competition (this competition is unrestricted). All future information about this acquisition including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This contract action may result in multiple awards, or one single award.  Contracts shall be Firm Fixed Price commercial item Purchase Orders, and may be awarded as a Base Year plus 4 option years.  The Government's requirement is for the following commercially available services:  C.1  Background  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is creating and staffing a new Office of Risk Assessment.  One responsibility of this office is providing means and mechanisms for early and focused identification of companies engaged in fraudulent, illegal or inappropriate (including misleading, opaque, or incomplete) financial reporting.  A companion interest in this objective will be to use risk assessment services or products to identify anomalies in disclosure or financial reporting by public companies subject to the SEC’s disclosure program.  For this purpose, the SEC is seeking computer-based products, services, or software.  Offerors are requested to provide a detailed Capabilities Statement for a commercial product capable of achieving some or all of these objectives. C.2 Scope Commercial products shall be used to identify companies requiring additional inquiry and investigation.  These products shall assist the SEC in identifying changes in financial position or operational results in financial statement presentations not evident in a routine reading of disclosure that may represent material deficiencies in the documents filed by public companies.  C.2.1  The initial focus of this analysis will initially be Forms 10-K (annual reports), 10-Q (quarterly reports), and possibly Form 20-F (foreign private issuers).  C.2.2  Offerors’ commercial products shall provide features such as historic coverage of data related to accounting and audit reports for publicly traded companies.  The commercial products shall have analytical capabilities that signal risk factors.  These tools may provide pre-selected criteria for risk analysis and/or allow for customized measures.  C.3  Objectives  Offerors shall provide commercial products having a flexible user interface and/or reporting capability.  An important performance objective is a high ratio of positive signals (problem companies or reports) to false signals (indications of problems that turn out to be incorrect).  More details in databases and computational platforms are provided in the next section.  C.3.1  Desired characteristics of commercial risk assessment products include the following kinds of evaluations and/or comparisons:  1)Evaluation of a company’s present and past financial data  2)Evaluation of a company’s financial ratios against parameters that may suggest inappropriate financial reporting exists  3)Evaluation of other performance measures that may suggest misleading, opaque or incomplete financial reporting  4)Comparison of a company with peers in an industry group  5)Comparison of a company’s risk evaluation with audit opinions  6)Comparison of a company’s accounting reports with other publicly available SEC information (e.g. litigation releases, accounting and auditing releases, EDGAR filings)  C.3.2  Offerors should address the extent to which financial statements conform to accounting standards, generally accepted industry practices, and the requirements of the federal securities laws and regulations.  C.4  Background and Current Environment  It is anticipated that specific risk assessment requirements and resulting objectives will evolve over time.  Consequently, the commercial products will also evolve in sophistication and complexity over time, especially at a point where there are data content tags for the reports filed with the Commission.  C.4.1 The commercial products shall initially provide for interoperability with respect to the SEC’s enterprise architecture.  The SEC’s current development environment includes 1) reporting tools such as Business Objects, Actuate, Crystal, and Brio; 2) databases such as Sybase ASE and Sybase IQ; 3) the Microsoft suite of tools (Access, Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, Visio); 4) development languages such as C, TCL, Java, J2EE, HTML, UML, XML, XSLT, JSP, Struts, and Servlets (used with TomCat as the JSP server for web development); 5) PureEdge to display internet forms; 6) web services technologies such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI; 7) Project Version Control System (PVCS) Tracker and PVCS Version Manager for configuration management of automated information systems; 8) Test Director for independent testing; 9) the search engine Autonomy; and 10) firewall and intrusion detection software.  The SEC’s current Technical Infrastructure standards include  A.  Application Servers such as Enterprise Systems:  Sun (Enterprise Servers 4000 series, 4500 series, V880 series, 280 series, E450 series)  Operating Environment:  Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u  Departmental Systems:  Sun (Ultra Sparc series, V120 series, 280 series) Operating Environment:  Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u   Workgroup Systems:  Compaq (File Servers - Proliant ML530, Other Compaq Special purpose servers).

Web Servers such as  Dell (Various Models), Sun (Enterprise Servers), Dell PowerEdge  Operating Environment:  Windows 2000, Solaris 2.8, Sun 4u  Software:  Netscape Suitespot 3.x, Apache, Microsoft IIS, Tomcat  C.  File Servers such as  Systems:  Dell 1650/2550/2650/6450/6650 (Dual Pentium III Processors)  (Migration):  Compliant Proliant ML360/560/580  Operating Environment: Microsoft NTS 4.0 Server/2000 (Migration):  Microsoft Windows 2003  C.4.2  Vendors shall be required to ensure confidentiality with respect to SEC queries of risk assessment services and the nature of the information derived from such queries and services.  Vendors shall ensure that no details of SEC usage are disclosed to the public, including possibly a prohibition against their disclosing that the SEC is a user of their product, service, or software.  Period of performance shall be for the period of 12 months.  Award is anticipated in May 2004.  The Government intends to issue one or more commercial item purchase orders for the above items to the responsible vendor whose Capabilities Statement /quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors which are in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate quotes: (1) technical acceptability (i.e., reliability and effectiveness of the product being proposed and its compatibility and interoperability with the SEC’s enterprise architecture),  (2) user training, (3) past performance for requirements that are similar to the SEC’s Statement of Objectives (offerors shall provide complete client contact information so that reference checks may be conducted), and (4)price.    If options are awarded, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price of all options to the total price of the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  This evaluation will be based on information provided by the contractor.  The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the Capabilities Statement or quotation, but may do so at its discretion. Only authorized representatives shall submit quotes. Please carefully review the commercial item clauses for information about requirements and instructions for submitting a quotation. Capabilities Statements that do not include prices for all items will not be considered. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.212.1, Instructions to Offeror- Commercial Items (OCT 2000); FAR provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer is considered to be most advantageous to the Government, considering technical acceptability, user training, past performance, and price.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions, therefore, it is critical that each quote be fully responsive.  However, the SEC also reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined to be necessary, with offerors making the competitive range (i.e., the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for the purposes of efficiency).  Only those offerors determined to be within the competitive range will be invited to present a demonstration of their product to the SEC and will be asked to provide 30 day access to their commercial item product, free of charge, for evaluation purposes.  FAR provision 52-212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) - all offerors shall include a completed copy of this provision with their quote; FAR clause 52-212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items (FEB 2002); FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (APR 2003) - in paragraph (b) the following clauses apply; 52.203-6 Alternate I, 52.222-3, 52.222-19,52.222.21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37,52.232-33,52.232-36, 52.239-1, 52.222-41,52.222-43, 52.222-44. 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) also applies.  Clauses incorporated by reference may be accessed in full text at www.arnet.gov. All Capabilities Statements (technical quotes)and price quotes from responsible sources will be considered. Questions may be submitted on or before 2:00 PM EST April 1, 2004.  The price quote shall be submitted as a completely separate document from the Capabilities Statement (technical quote).  Two (2) copies of each Capabilities Statement (technical quote) and two (2) copies of each price quote shall be submitted to Debra E. Chapman, clearly marked RFQ no. SECHQ1-04-Q-0028 either via hand delivery or U.S. Mail to Securities and Exchange Commission, MS-020, 6432 General Green Way, Alexandria VA 22312, or to chapmand@sec.gov, or faxed to (703) 914-9226 no later than 12:00 Noon EST, April 5, 2004.

<DESC>Questions and Answers for the commercial non-maneuverable troop personnel main parachute canopy AMENDMENT 001 This combined synopsis solicitation is hereby amended as follows: The number of days that offerors shall be in the test site at Yuma, AZ has changed from five (5) to twelve (12) work days as follows: Offerors shall be at the test site location at Yuma, AZ two (2) work days prior to the first test period and for two (2) test periods of five (5) consecutive work days, for a total of twelve (12) work days at the site location.  There will be a one (1) wee k break between test periods.   Q 1.  In the interest of providing multiple options to the Government, it is our intention to support the subject solicitation by providing responses for three different parachute systems.  We request an extension from April 8, 2004 to April 20, 2004 in or der to provide the U.S. Army with fully compliant proposals that fulfill the needs of the Government. A.

The Government will consider 1,000 hours billable labor rate to support Ã¢Â€Âœminor alterationsÃ¢Â€Â during testing if needed by the Government.  The work effort could involve labor for engineering, fabrication worker and draftsperson. Q 3. Can I make the assumption that as the Government desires some level of support from the contractor, that it will modify an awarded contract to reflect that level of effort at a specified cost?   A.  Yes.
