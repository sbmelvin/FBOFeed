300-FF-2 Operable Unit
West Side Remediation

As part of the ongoing effort to clean up the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Hanford site in Southeastern Washington State, the environmental restoration contractor (ERC) for the DOE, Bechtel Hanford, Inc., (BHI) is seeking qualified small business to perform remedial action activities.  The activities are associated with cleanup of certain solid waste sites in the 300-FF-2 Operable Unit near the 300 area reactor complex.  The work, regulated under CERCLA, is expected to commence in the summer of 2005, and required approximately 2 years to complete.  The estimated subcontract value is $6-10M.

The work involves excavation the 618-1, 618-7, 618-3, and 300 BTS sites to removed radiologically and/or chemically contaminated soils and debris.  Work may be performed in radiation areas (including High Radiation Areas and Airborne Radiation Areas) and in various levels of PPE (including supplied air).

618-1 Burial Ground
The 618-7 Burial Ground consists of two trenches and one V-shaped pit.  Each of the trenches is approximately 650 ft long, 100 ft wide, and 13-15 ft deep.  Miscellaneous contaminated equipment and hundreds of drums of Zircaloy-2 chips alloyed with beryllium and contaminated with uranium were buried the trenches.  The drums were filled with water to mitigate the pyrophoric property of the Zircaloy-2 chips.  Other low level materials that were slightly contaminated with uranium and thorium were also buried in the trenches.  The V-shaped pit is approximately 140 ft long and 20 ft wide and was used for disposal of thorium contaminated waste.  In 2004, a field investigation was conducted in the two main trenches to evaluate excavation and handling of drums containing Zircaloy-2 chips.  Material encountered during the investigation included bulk metal turnings (stainless steel, aluminum), process equipment, drums containing trash and miscellaneous debris.  Drums containing Zircaloy chips were not encountered during the investigation.

618-7 Burial Ground
The overall dimension of the burial ground is not known for certain.  However, it is known that the burial ground contains 2 trenches and a pit.  Each trench is 650 feet long, 100 feet wide and 13-15 feet deep.  The pit is 140 feet long and 20 feet wide. Drummed containers holding solvent with moderate amounts of uranium were buried in the trenches.  Other low-level material, slightly contaminated with uranium and thorium as well as hundreds of drums of zircaloy chips, slightly contaminated with beryllium, were also buried in the trenches.

618-13 Contaminated Soil Burial Site
The 618-13 site consists of a mound of soil approximately 15-20 feet high, 125 feet long, and 50 feet wide.  The site was originally a disposal area for uranium contaminated soil.  

300 Vitrification Test Site (VTS)
The VTS site is approximately 340 feet long and 250 feet wide.  The in-situ vitrification of radioactive and hazardous waste was performed at this location.  Tests using polychlorinated biphenols (PCBs) and limited tests with very low levels of radioactivity were conducted at the site.  Several in-situ monoliths, 900-6000 tons each, are believed to remain underground.

The contaminated materials will be size reduced as necessary, and loaded into 20-ton containers.  The containers will be staged and manifested for transport to Hanford’s Environmental Restoration disposal Facility (ERDF).  The work to be completed does not include the transportation to and disposal of the contaminated material at ERDF.

Pre-qualification is required to receive the request for proposal.  Please go to http://www.bhi-erc.com/Opportunities/DoingBus/90-day.htm to fill out the pre-qualification questionnaire.  For more information, e-mail supplierforum@bhi-erc.com

<SUBJECT>99--DON-SNOTE-041027-004 Modification: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR JOINT UNMANNED SYSTEMS COMMON CONTROL
<SOLNBR>041027004
<RESPDATE>111204
<ARCHDATE>12122004
<CONTACT>Allan Ziemba 850-235-5197 , or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>This modification provides directions to obtain the Attachments to this announcement.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY (RFI)!  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC-PC) at Panama City, FL is requesting information from industry for a new integrated capability to concurrently manage multiple unmanned systems of all types (air, sea surface, undersea, and ground), and to do so with an application of joint messaging standards that will help lead to the eventual state where most unmanned systems across all the services are truly interoperable.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, BUT RATHER A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY from industry on existent planning tools and other software or algorithm products that could potentially add functional value to a standards-based open architecture.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and NSWC-PC will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI.  Res! ponses to the RFI will not be returned. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  At present, a single architecture that allows for the concurrent management of large numbers of unmanned systems of all types using joint interoperability standards, is non-proprietary, scaleable and open to support expansion and affordable technology refresh does not exist. The primary goal of the NAVSURFWARCEN Panama City's Joint Unmanned Systems Common Control (JUSC2) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) is to integrate select Commercial and Government Off-the-Shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies, legacy systems, and emergent joint standards to provide a first spiral development of such an architecture, and to develop and demonstrate a Joint Concept of Operations that will enhance the joint force commander's ability to conduct effective joint and coalition operations.  The approach to this program is not an attempt to build a single com! mon control system, but to federate separate USV, UAV, USV, and UGV common control segments onto a common LAN with open architecture standards applied in two areas.  The first area is Joint interoperability messaging standards (Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems, or JAUS and NATO STANAGs for UAVs) being developed within DoD that will be applied to unmanned R&D systems currently in development.  Select systems are being modified to conform to the joint standards and inter-service operation and control hand-off will be demonstrated.  For select unmanned systems that are already in the acquisition program stage, plans and estimated cost & schedule for joint standards conversion will be developed.  The second area of standards application is within the local area network (LAN) that integrates the separate control segments into a common system.  Open Architecture (OA) standards will be applied to the processing segments to ensure that new capabilities or individual unmanned ! systems can be inserted into the architecture with a minimum of change required to the overall system to maintain affordability and configuration control.  The separate legacy control segments, once integrated, communicate with a higher level common unmanned systems management system/operator interface that applies the functions shown in the left column of Attachment 1 to produce a capability to concurrently manage large numbers of all types of unmanned systems.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information on technologies that could be relevant for consideration for technology refresh of this architecture beyond the ACTD, which has a near-term focus on the Littoral Combat ship.  The intent is to explore further development for broader joint unmanned systems applications across all services.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses. This RFI seeks descriptions of candidate techn! ologies that potentially offer one or more of the capabilities listed in Attachment 1 (Table 1).  Additionally, a synopsis should be included in the submission to include, but not be limited to the following: Conceptual Alternatives, Feasibility Assessment, Estimated Cost and Schedule Estimates, Corporate Expertise, and any other suggestions or discussion the respondent deems appropriate. In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, security requirements, security assurance processes, and any relevant lessons learned.  In addition to a synopsis, submissions must include the prescribed format in the attachment to this synopsis for ease of review and prioritization.  This is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.   Responders should indicate which portions of their res! ponse are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  NSWC-PC may hold an information exchange meeting to discuss this RFI with interested potential respondents.  Details about this meeting will be made available at a later date.  If you wish to attend such a meeting please notify the synopsis contact.   All correspondence related to this matter should be e-mailed (preferred) in Microsoft Office format to Allan.Ziemba@navy.mil, faxed to (850)234-4251, or mailed to arrive no later then  3:00 PM on 12 November 2004.  This synopsis may be found at  http://www.ncsc.navy.mil/Contracts/Ztables/syntable.htm.  The attachment is posted on the Synopses page.

<DESC>The Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 is seeking potential scientific partners to submit a proposal to the Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP).  The JFSP is a partnership of six Federal wildland and fire and research organizations, was established in 1998 to provide scientific information and support for fuel and fire management programs. All JFSP projects require scientist-manager partnerships along with strong emphasis on transferring research findings to the field.  Guidance for the program includes four original ?principal purposes? all related to wildland fuels: Fuels inventory and mapping, Evaluation of fuels treatments, Scheduling of fuels treatments, Development of protocols for monitoring and evaluation. In 2001, Congress further directed JFSP to expand its research efforts in post-fire rehabilitation and stabilization, local assistance, and aircraft-based remote sensing. JFSP research also examines air quality, smoke management and social aspects of fire and fuels management. In setting priorities for funding, the program responds to congressional direction, recommendations from advisory committees and member agencies, along with collective input from key agency personnel, workshops, and informational meetings. The program focus is on short-term, applied research that provides information and tools to specialists and managers, helping them make the best possible decisions and develop sound, scientifically valid plans. The JFSP encourages proposals from all interested parties.  However, because the focus of the JFSP is on wildland fire and fuels issues on Federal wildlands, evidence of direct involvement by Federal scientists or land managers in the development of proposals must be included in all proposals.  Proposals that do not have evidence of direct involvement by federal land managers or scientists will not be considered for funding.  Examples of documented involvement by land managers or scientists include participation as a Principal Investigator, cooperator, or collaborator; letters of commitment and support; and written evidence from the manager that the proposal is responding to an urgent fire or fuels problem related to the land manager?s unit."  Interested and capable parties with scientific proposal ideas for the undertaking of studies in Alaska who can demonstrate relevance to Alaska?s National Wildlife Refuge System are encouraged to contact us to discuss a possible partnership.  There is no Region 7 specific soliciation packet, nor is there a "bidder's list" to get on.  This is an opportunity for you to come to us with competitive ideas that fit within the programmatic description. A "twin" posting of this announcement # 701815R009 is posted to http://fedgrants.gov/Applicants/DOI/FWS/FWS_R7/701815R009/Grant.html. Interested parties must contact Karen A.

The location will be at the P.V. McNamara Federal Building in Room 1540.  Any further announcements regarding this solicitation will be posted in FedBizzOpps at www.eps.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center,  Panama City (NSWC –PC) intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to Vehicle Control Technologies (VCT) to investigate the accuracy of the AN/AQS-20A localizer, trailback algorithm.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  Vehicle Control Technologies (VCT) has performed all of the mathematic modeling for the AN/AQS-20/A tow body.  VCT is the company that created and owns the localizer algorithm.  To accurately correlate and validate the AN/AQS-20A model is critical to the operation of the AN/AQS-20A.  Use of another company to modify the algorithm may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable error into the AN/AQS-20A system.  Failure to have an accurate model could result in significant damage to the AN/AQS-20A tow body and maybe even loss of U. S. Navy vessels.  Therefore, this acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity P! anama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL  32407-7018.  NAICS Code 541330 applies.

The resulting contract is expected to have a Base Year (beginning on or about July 01, 2005) and four single year option periods (continuing through June 30, 2010 if all options are exercised).  The associated NAICS Code is 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This procurement will not be made under FAR Part 12 provisions.  This effort will support the NERL/ORD's broad responsibilities in characterizing and quantifying the source, transport, transformation, fate and characterization of a wide variety of toxic pollutants across the human exposure and ecological paradigm.  It will also include determinations of the physical, chemical, and other characteristics of aerosol pollutants which include particulate matter (PM) and gases, and how these characteristics affect the entry of the pollutants into humans and the environment.  This will be NERL/ORD's leading research vehicle for the following research responsibilities:  (1) develop and validate instrumentation, (2) methodologies (including U.S. EPA reference Methods), (3) manuals, (4) guidelines, (5) Standard Operating Procedures, and (6) Quality Assurance Procedures (QAP) for the measurement of ambient levels fo pollutants of concern to the U.S. EPA.  These resultant instruments, methods, QAP, etc., will be used by the U.S. EPA as it's major basis of validating measurements of ambient levels of pollutants that are of concern to the U.S. EPA.  The U.S. EPA relies on the validated instrumentation methodology and QAP as it is the main source of support in determining the validity of it's ambient pollutant determinations.  The U.S. EPA's ambient pollutant data is an essential part of the basis for the U.S. EPA's regulatory ambient air standards for enforcement of the standards.  A pre-proposal conference will be held in association with this procurement.  Interested parties should monitor the U.S. EPA's website shown at the end of this announcement for further details.  It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on or about November 30, 2004.  Proposals will be due approximately 45 days after the Request for Proposals (RFP) issuance date.  This acquisition represents a follow-on to contract 68-D-00-206.  A copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) for contract 68-D-00-206 is posted for review, at the internet site listed below.  The solicitation and all amendments for this procurement will be available via the internet at the following URL:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) executes the mission and functions of the Missile Defense Data Center (MDDC) under an agreement with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA).  The contractor will be expected to provide MDDC mission support to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) in developing and fielding an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) by managing past, present and future MDA-related data products from Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) technology research, developmen t, testing, and evaluation, M&S and service specific Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence data facilitating access to MDA-related data products across the MDA enterprise; and producing MDA-related data products to support MDA technology, devel opment, testing and evaluation.  The MDDC program will evolve around executing the following four key functional areas:   1) Core Functions  2) Disaster Recovery   3) Legacy Data  4)  Non-Core Functions.  In general, the contractor selected for award will be expected to provide support as set forth in the Scope of Work (SOW).  These areas are not meant to be definitive, but rather represent in summary form, the general areas to be supported.  Therefore, the SOW is deemed to be a basic expression of the over all contract requirement.  Specific performance requirements will be set forth in the Task Orders (T/Os) issued under the contract.  The T/Os may be issued in support of any area of the current MDA Data Centers Program Management Plan (MDA DCP MP), as ame nded.  The MDDC contract will be managed by SMDC via a contract-level Technical Monitor (TM)  and Task Order Monitor (T/OM) assigned to each specific Task Order. In general, the contractor will be expected to: 1) collaborate with the government and work to gether to provide the vision, direction, plans and execution to increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the MDDC Program and its processes; 2) collaborate and interface with the other MDA Data Centers and contractor(s) of similar organizations  to share information and best practices; 3) monitor other data centers development, processes and results as well as those of current industry leaders to identify and recommend best practices that may be adopted or adapted to improve the overall efficien cy and effectiveness of the MDDC.  Stake holder and customer satisfaction, cost control, and technical performance shall be considered during the process; 4) procure hardware and software as required per T/O requirements; 5) maintain government-furnished p roperty/government furnished equipment (GFP/GFE); maintain and operate the MDDC during government business hours and, upon special request, 24/7, on weekends, and government holidays; 6) maintain the GFP/GFE to provide data access and analysis capability t o government-designated users during government business hours; 7) track and identify the GFP/GFE as required to pass inspections; 8) support the MDDC by publicizing the MDDC to the MDA Community, its potential users and programs by way of sending MDDC rep resentatives to exhibits, symposiums, conferences and participating contractor sites (with proper approvals). It has been determined that the resultant contract will not contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause.  All effort under the res ultant contract will be performed at the MDDC Facility (currently located at 106 Wynn Drive, Huntsville, AL).  All contractor personnel working at the government location must have at least a secret security clearance and at least 25% of the contractor per sonnel working at the government location must possess a top secret security clearnance.   Small Businesses should note the FAR 19 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and size standard is 541710/1000 employees. This acquisition is no t open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The MDDC will be located in a government facility in Huntsville, Al for the duration of the contract.  The resultant contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract and set aside for small business.  It will consist of a one-year basic and four (4) one-year options.  The Government does not intend to li mit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams). Further, we do no t intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award.

<DESC>THIS FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TO INFORM PROSPECTIVE DEVELOPERS THAT THE SCOTT AFB, IL, MFH PRIVATIZATION PROJECT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) IS ANTICIPATED TO BE RELEASED ON OR ABOUT 29 NOVEMBER 2004.  THE INDUSTRY FORUM HAS ALREADY BEEN HELD.  Jones Lang LaSalle Privatization Support Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) and the Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) anticipates the release of its Request for Proposal for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Scott AFB, IL on or about 29 November 2004.  Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a two-step RFP process.  In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Scott AFB project.  The Air Force  will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Scott AFB project.  In the second step, up to three qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals.  The Air Force will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and select a Successful Offeror (SO) on the basis of the most advantageous proposal to the Air Force.  The Scott AFB Housing Privatization Project will be initiated with a real estate transaction. The objective of the transaction is to provide quality homes for Military Families and management of a 1,593-unit housing community for a period of at least 50 years. The existing 1,430 housing units, secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will be conveyed to the SO.  The Government will lease its land. The SO will be responsible for providing additional new land to satisfy the requirements of the RFP.  The Government may provide the SO a loan, secured by a second mortgage, for a portion of the project’s development costs. The SO will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Scott AFB family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Statement of Need is available at http://www.jllpsc.com.

<DESC>NOTE: All Prospective Offerors:  Please review all updated attached files below and provide your comments and questions by 3 December 2004.  It is  important that you provide your comments and questions because they will be  used in developing the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  There are two areas  of particular interest we would like to hear from industry.  First, is how to  handle Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) after contract completion.  Secondly,  some of the foreign PROS users would like the ability to return material  purchased through the PROS program, for any reason, within 90 days of  receipt.  This does not include requirements submitted for investigation under  the Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process.  Foreign customer SDRs will be  processed through the standard SDR process.   SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III)  ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought Parts and Repair  Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and  operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently  active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some  customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives  more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material  (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is  not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for  supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However,  the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD  approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of  the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized)  sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award  fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy  Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised  to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of  contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.   SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested and qualified sources are requested to provide a  statement of current capability and past performance information no later than  27 August 2004.

<DESC>Chemical and Biological (CB) Protective Footwear THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL NOR DOES THE GOVERNMENT INTEND TO PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.   On behalf of the Marine Corps Systems Command, the Contracts Department are seeking to obtain CB protective footwear information and product samples, and to examine that information and test those items that involve innovative, emerging technologies.  The results will be used for developing future acquisition strategies and approaches in moving towards the desired end state of CB footwear protection.  That desired end state is CB protection integrated within the standard combat uniform; such as use of a standard combat boot and/or sock that provides adequate CB protection.  The final product, or treatment, may become a component of the Joint Protective Aircrew Ensemble (JPACE), Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST) and/or the then-current CB protective ensembles.  The Joint Project Management Office for Individual Protection (JPMO-IP) is seeking potential sources for such a product.  For reference purposes only, the estimated procurement potential is ! in the range of 4 to 7 million pairs of the final product.  This is an open search, and not limited to the current CB footwear solution that requires the use of overboots.  Responses to this solicitation may involve material or products that are in any stage of development.  Performance areas of particular interest that may be tested on samples submitted include, but are not limited to: CB protection (vapor, liquid and aerosol), traction, heat stress, mobility, packaged weight and volume, melting, and flame resistance, integration with CB ensembles, durability, comfort, etc.   Responders should include a description of all their technologies, commercialized or in development, which address CB protective footwear.  Responders are invited and encouraged to submit product samples for evaluation at no cost to the Government.  If a product of the nature described is already available, we request submittal of a sample size of 30 pairs for preliminary evaluations at the Government’s discretion.  The samples should be provided in a representative tariff of sizes that fit a standard population along with care and use instructions.   Also, all samples shall be clearly labeled as being submitted in response to this RFI.  If the submission of materials only is deemed appropriate at this time, material samples should be provided at a quantity of two (2) square yards.  The material sides should be clearly labeled inside and outside or state there is no difference if appropriate. To the extent possible, product samples should be accompanied by the appropriate Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), Safety Assessment Report in accordance with DI-SAFT-80102B, and a Health Hazard Analysis Report in accordance with DI-SAFT-80106B.  These items will allow the Government to readily obtain a safety release prior to testing, if determined necessary.  This RFI action is separate and distinct from the Alternative Footwear Solutions (AFS) and Integrated Footwear System (IFS) program solicitations that are currently under review or in process.  Nevertheless, testing may be done concurrently with these programs at the Government’s discretion.  Any additional information deemed beneficial to providing the Government a better understanding of your company’s capabilities or uniqueness as related to CB protective footwear should also be provided. DISCLAIMER This RFI is issued solely for market research, information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  No solicitation exists at this time.  The information received in response to this RFI may be used for developing an acquisition strategy and any resultant solicitation that may occur.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  It is noted, however, that the information submitted may be made available to non-competing, other than Government personnel to assist in the review process.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Submission of material, samples or information in response to this RFI shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items/services, or for the Government to pay for the information or samples received.

This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2).  Technical POC:  Dr. Raymond Meilunas, (301) 342-8064.  
I.  INTRODUCTION:  
The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR) and the Polymers/Composites Branch of the Aerospace Materials Division under the Air Vehicle Department (AIR 4.3) is soliciting proposals for research and development (R&D) concepts in the area of polymers and composite materials and structures to support current and future Naval Aviation needs.  Concepts proposed may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology.  

II.	BACKGROUND.  
The mission of the Polymers & Composites Branch of the NAVAIR Aerospace Materials Division is to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop, evaluate, and transition those technologies into NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS to impart new military capabilities.  To this end, NAVAIR is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below.  Proposal may be either basic or applied research.  Proposals that are not within the topical areas described below may be considered out of scope and not evaluated.  Proposals that are not research, but rather integration considered out of scope and not evaluated.  Proposals that are not research, but rather integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.  While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposers included a Phase I of no more than 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success.  This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded. 

III.	SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST.  
New Materials, Material Concepts, Materials Processing applied to polymers and composites.  Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:  development and application of new and improved resins, structural reinforcing fibers, core and foam materials, adhesives, and sealants/coatings for naval aviation composite applications; new and/or lower cost manufacturing processes for structural composites (including applications; new and/or lower cost manufacturing processes for structural composites (including tooling); process modeling; engineered materials for LO applications; high temperature resins/adhesives; structural and non-structural adhesives; Nanomaterials and structural nanocomposites, including carbon nanotubes; composites; galvanic corrosion; Optical materials and coatings for aircraft transparencies and their repair; self-healing, -sensing and –adapting polymers and composites; smart and adaptive (morphing) materials and structures; and structural and multifunctional (structure + function) materials; repair technologies, biomaterials and biomimetic materials.  Ideas outside of the advertised focused areas will be considered in scope provided they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the interest of the office.  

IV.	CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE.  
NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Grants, Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions).  Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other_trans.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research, or by contacting Julie A. Blew at (301) 757-8955 or by email at julie.blew@navy.mil.  Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government.  NOTE:  Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project.  Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal).  In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.   THERE IS NO SOLLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  I. INTRODUCTION:   This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government  WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this request for information nor will the Government compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information for the Government.  Any request for copies of solicitations will not be addressed since this is a request for information, not a request for proposal.  It is requested that information in response to paragraphs I-IV of this RFI be submitted NO LATER THAN October 15, 2004 to Ms. Alice Tornquist, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25222B562-1, Highway 547, Lakehurst NJ 08733 or by email at alice.tornquist@navy.mil . Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. The RFI process will be conducted as follows: (a) The information received in response to this RFI will be used for market research purposes; (b) Also, the Government will host two Industry Days on November 16-17, 2004 as detailed in Paragraph (V) below. 

II. PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this RFI is to gather information on available and emerging Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Non-Developmental test and measurement products/technologies that may potentially enable the objectives stated in paragraph (4) below.  Those responding to this request may categorize responses by identifying candidate products/technologies that currently exist, those currently under development, and those that can be planned and scheduled.  Interested parties may provide any information (specifications, brochures, product application papers, etc) on current or emerging products that address the stated objectives to the above address. The information provided may or may not be used to assist the Government in formulating and refining its approach for addressing its needs.

III.  BACKGROUND: Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), and the Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) are working collectively to demonstrate the potential implementation of a suite of virtual and/or synthetic test instruments, currently referred to collectively as an Advanced Virtual Instrument Test System (AVITS) to provide a common Navy and Marine Corps platform for emulating General Purpose Electronic Test Equipment (GPETE) needed to satisfy a variety of electronic test applications at the Organizational Level (O-Level) of maintenance. It is envisioned that AVITS would provide a common hardware and software architecture that could be easily reconfigured into multiple packaging schemes to support specific O-Level maintenance test applications or to provide a required suite of GPETE.  Initial demonstration applications may include the following: (1) a GPETE emulator for use at organizational maintenance levels across the Navy and Marine Corps (Digital Multimeter, 100 MHz Oscilloscope, Frequency Counter, Signal Generator, & RF Power Meter, as a minimum), (2) the potential for automation of NAVSEA periodic maintenance procedures that traditionally require multiple manual measurements at various test points with conventional GPETE, and (3) an O-Level radio test application for support of the Navy Surface Fleet and Marine Corps Ground Forces.

IV. OBJECTIVES: The principal objectives of the AVITS concept of operations are to provide the Navy and USMC maintainer with the following:  (1) the capability to configure multiple, programmable virtual/synthetic instruments into a portable, light weight, single-standard, multiple protocol packaging scheme for use at O-Level, (2) a capability that provides an interface to distance support assistance and training applications, and (3) a system that reduces total ownership costs within the Navy and the USMC.  To further these objectives, AVITS should provide (a) “plug-and-play” instrument functionality along with self-test and self-system verification (calibration), one control/display with multiple virtual control/display panels,  (b) an integrated test executive engine that allows for automated Maintenance Requirement Card (MRC) applications, and (c) the ability to collect/transmit test data in a format and language compatible with legacy maintenance data management software currently in use.  In addition, AVITS should be software upgradeable to support the emerging Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) and the Automated Test Mark-up Language (ATML), based on the eXtensible Mark-up Language (XML).  These are emerging industry standards used to facilitate closed loop diagnostics by providing an interface control/data transfer standard between maintenance systems.   ATML will provide the standard software interfaces for emerging knowledge based maintenance data systems to enable integrated diagnostics.    Finally, AVITS should provide for reduced costs to outfit new construction ships sufficiently inherent configuration flexibility to allow for management of specific subsystem obsolescence, reduced personnel training costs on both the GPETE and the Prime Systems it services, reduced maintenance and calibration costs compared to the previously utilized discrete GPETE, and improved operational capability and system readiness.

V. INDUSTRY DAYS: The Government will host two industry days on November 16-17, 2004 at the Embassy Suites LAX South, 1440 E. Imperial Avenue, El Segundo, California, US, 90245.  (a) The purpose of these Industry Days is to provide interested parties a face-to-face opportunity to make the Navy and Marine Corps aware of their commercial products/technologies that they believe can potentially satisfy the objectives described in Paragraph (4) above. (b) One-hour meetings may be scheduled from 9:00 am – 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm – 4:00 pm each day.  Meetings will be held in a closed door, boardroom setting and government team members will sign non-disclosure agreements as required.  (c) Standard power, presentation boards, and a LCD projector will be provided.  Two rooms have been reserved, allowing presenters one-half hour each for set-up and tear-down.  (d) Hotel reservations may be made at the Embassy Suites by calling (310) 640-3600 and using the “AVT” reservation code. (e) Requests for participation should be emailed to alice.tornquist@navy.mil.  Requests are to include the following:  the name of the organization, perferred meeting day and time,  the technology that will briefed, point of contact, and list of  prospective attendees.  Any power or other special requirements to support a demonstration should also be identified in the request. Meeting times will be assigned on a first come, first served basis. Requests for participation must be received no later than one week prior to the date of the meeting.  (Fax number for Alice Tornquist below is corrected to read 732-323-2359.)

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested commercial sources by the U.S. Army Space & Missile Defense Command (SMDC), in conjunction with the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HEL JTO) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFR L), regarding the ability of firms to develop high-power, solid-state laser (SSL) technologies suitable for future military applications.  This sources-sought notice is published in accordance with FAR Part 15.201, and is a RFI for planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment by the U.S. Government, nor should it be construed as such.  Respondents are advised that SMDC is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback t o respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.  There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  The Government WILL NOT award a contract on the basis of t his RFI, and WILL NOT reimburse the costs incurred by providing the information requested under this notice.  This RFI is open to any capable and qualified commercial sources, and partnering is encouraged. Specifically, SMDC is seeking sources that are capable of developing diode-pumped SSL laboratory device(s) over a two to three year period of time, with measured laboratory performance that is traceable to weapon systems applications.  The three most criti cal performance goals are considered to be overall efficiency (greater than 20%), near diffraction-limited (DL) beam quality (1.1 x DL), and output power (greater than 100 kilowatts), with the objective being maturation of the technology to the point requi red for continued weapon system development.  Run time and output power-to-weight ratio are other performance parameters of interest, with goals of 300 seconds of continuous operation and 50 watts per kilogram (W/kg) desired, with thresholds of 100 seconds  and 20 W/kg. Instructions to Responders: Responders should provide a high-level description of their research capabilities in SSL technology and their capabilities for doing system-level trades and assessments for application of these technologies in integrated weapon system concepts for a broad spectrum of military operations.  The types of military operations of interest include ground-to-ground engagements of static targets such as unexploded ordnance; ground-to-air engagements of airborne and ballistic threats such as rockets, mortars, artille ry, and unmanned aerial vehicles; and air-to-ground precision strike engagements. Capabilities provided should be as specific as possible, and should identify unique technical development experience and qualifications in specific areas.  Responders should also provide comments on the feasibility of achieving the above laboratory perform ance goals with different types of SSLs, whether it be slab, disk, or fiber optic laser.  Information is requested in response to the following specific questions:      1) What are the current scaling issues associated with reaching significant powers (100kW) with near diffraction-limited output from both bulk (slab or disk) and fiber-based SSL systems?      2) Where do you consider investments are needed most (in priority) to achieve a high power SSL (bulk or fiber) system?      3) What are the primary risk issues that must be considered for your SSL concept that must be resolved in order to achieve the proposed SSL performance goals?      4) Are the proposed thresholds and goals for run time and output power per kilogram reasonable?  This must consider total system weight, including thermal management, electrical power, and power conditioning.      5) What maximum power do you feel is reasonably achievable in a fiber system within the next two to three years?      6) In your estimate, how long would it take to develop and demonstrate:  (A)  A laboratory-based 10 0kW bulk system?    (B)  A field demonstrator 100kW bulk system?    (C)  A laboratory-based 25kW fiber system?    (D)  A field demonstrator 25kW fiber system?  The responses should not exceed 10 pages in length, and should be delivered to Karen Parmenter, Contracting Officer, U.S. Army SMDC, SMDC-CM-CT, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801, no later than 30 days from the date of this notice.  Electronic submi ssion to karen.parmenter@us.army.mil is the preferred method of submission. All respondents shall include their assigned Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  Responders are further required to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees.

Documentation and technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company/team possess es the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.  Interested firms should submit an email and attach the capability statement within 15 days after the date of this announcement to nicole.meenen@smdc.army.mil (title email JIEDD-Task Force Spt).  Any questions can be directed to Ms. Meenen.  If a solicitation is issued it will be announced at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses t o this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.  Capability papers (no more than 5 pages) should address that the contractor or contractor team has the demonstrated ability to perform the entire task.   The current effort to be performed under this contract is in direct support of operational forces who are experiencing frequent attacks by hostile forces using Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED).  Rece ntly the Deputy Secretary of Defense ordered the JIEDD-TF, directed by a Flag Officer, to focus all available DOD resources to counter this threat.  Further, the Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) G3 is currently developing plans for the establishm ent of a new unit, The Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) to accept the hand off of a portion of the JIEDD-TF mission.  In addition to supporting the creation of a new unit, the JIEDD-TF must continue all assigned missions and tasks without interruption in ord er to support the needs of deployed forces in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Among Army responses to the problem will be the placement of field teams into the Theater of Operations to thoroughly investigate IED/VBIED attacks and provide informatio n to the Director of the JIEDD-TF on behalf of the Army and Central Command.  In particular, the Director, JIEDD-TF and Army G3 will require a high level of expertise in the areas of counter insurgency (CI) and counter terrorism (CT).  Specifically, the of feror must have extensive experience in advisement and support concerning Joint Special Operations, to include operational and developmental experience in the use of explosives and their initiation, and the tactics and techniques associated with the use of  explosives particularly as it relates to IED/VBIED devices.  Moreover, experience must include individuals with extensive backgrounds and established reputations in the developmen t, organization, preparation and leadership of teams formed to respond in direct support of the vital interests of the Nation.  Contracted effort requires Security Clearance Classification of Top Secret- Special Compartmentalized Information (TS-SCI).  Eff ort will consist of the following: Advisement Team with established expertise in terrorist, guerilla and insurgent operations, experience with Joint Special Operations Forces and its relation to the development, formation, preparation and staffing of speci al teams in direct support of National level objectives.  This team will have experience synchronizing the transition of major projects and programs from short life-cycle management to long term strategic efforts. This team will have demonstrated experienc e in recruitment, assessment, selection, and training procedure development.  Strategic Communications/Public affairs experience in information dissemination to the Soldier, the public, industry and other Government organizations is also required.  Support  Team will assist in coordinating, integrating, and synchronizing task force operations and shall serve as liaison between the G3 and eventual Asymmetric Warfare Group, facilitating eventual mission transfer to the AWG.  This team will have a demonstrated Operational capability to forecast, track, assess current operations and perform problem solving for the JIEDD-TF Operations Officer.  Team shall contain a research analyst and Program Coordinator for the Training Advisory Team.  Training Advisory Team wil l consist of certified explosive experts trained and qualified, at a minimum, to U.S. Army standards to advise and train units at major unit installations and Combat Training Centers throughout CONUS and other countries or locations at the direction of the  JIEDD-TF or HQDA G3 preparing them for combat operations and eventual deployment to any AOR. Field Investigative Teams will consist of multiple teams consisting of broadly gauged experts to perform the training of IED mitigation measures and counter IED t actics, techniques and procedures to forces committed and forces preparing for entry into regions of hostility.  The investigative teams could be directed to investigate IED incidents and technologies anywhere in the world.   Advisement, Support, Training Advisory and Field Investigative Teams will also possess the proven skills, abilities and cognitive traits for operating in highly stressful environments of Counter-Insurgency and Counter-Terrorism threats.  These teams will show demonstrated abilities for adaptation to meet mission requirements addressing undefined and evolving Asymmetric threats.   This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The proposed acquisition may involve a potential conflict of interest as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 9.5.

<SUBJECT>A--NASA ADVANCED PLANNING & INTEGRATION OFFICE (APIO) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<DESC>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Advanced Planning and Integration Office (APIO), NASA Headquarters, Code FA, 300 E Street S.W., Washington D.C. 20546-0001. INTRODUCTION: NASA is currently preparing a set of high-level national roadmaps that will form the foundation of the Agency’s strategic plan. “Strategic Roadmaps” will explore options and establish pathways for achievement of NASA’s strategic objectives.  “Capability Roadmaps” will recommend approaches for providing certain technical capabilities judged to be critical to NASA’s future programs. The purpose of this request is to solicit contributions to the roadmap development process, with the goal of ensuring that the best and widest possible set of ideas is considered in the formulation of NASA’s plans for the future. The information collected via this RFI will be supplied to Strategic and Capability Roadmap teams to inform their deliberations and discussions. It is anticipated that the final roadmaps and the integrated architecture may ultimately contribute to NASA strategic investment decisions, but this RFI in no way constitutes a promise or expectation of future funding opportunities from NASA.	 The requested information can be submitted to NASA in any of three different ways: 1. Participation in a NASA Capability Roadmap Public Workshop to be held on November 30, 2004. 2. Submission of capability concept papers for inclusion in the workshop documentation. 3. Submission of strategic concept papers that will be included in the Strategic Roadmap development process but that will not be associated with a general workshop. NASA’s key strategic and capability focus areas, which are the topics of the individual roadmaps. Roadmap teams will be formed to address each of these topic areas. The teams will be composed of representatives from NASA, JPL, other government agencies, academia, and private industry.  Therefore, DO NOT SUBMIT PROPRIETARY OR COMPETITION SENSITIVE INFORMATION in response to this RFI.   SUMMARY: With this RFI, NASA is seeking information regarding strategies, mission concepts, investigations, capabilities, and technologies that may enable or enhance NASA’s ability to carry out its mission for the nation.

<SUBJECT>Q -- TRICARE Healthcare for retired beneficiaries residing in the Philippines
<DESC>The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is seeking industry input for the provision of health care services to approximately 9,000 eligible beneficiaries in the Philippines.  The TMA is an activity within the Department of Defense with responsibility for delivering a health care benefit to eligible TRICARE beneficiaries.  These beneficiaries generally include dependents of active duty service members, retired service members and their dependents as well as survivors of active duty and retired military personnel.

	The overseas benefit available to TRICARE beneficiaries is similar to a broad spectrum indemnity program with cost shares from 20% to 25% and an annual deductible and catastrophic cap protection.  The details of the benefit may be found on the TMA web site at www.tricare.osd.mil.  The Department of Defense does not have the ability to provide the TRICARE benefit in the Philippines with military clinicians and hospitals.  As such, we are examining alternatives for purchasing the benefit.  The alternatives currently under consideration include, but are not limited to:

1.  Enrolled PPO.  In this option, the Government would solicit bids from a single contractor to whom beneficiaries may enroll.  The Government would specify the benefit, cost-share, and performance standards for access to care, claims processing, customer services, etc.  The Government could assume all risk for the actual cost of health care, share the risk with the contractor, or transfer the risk to the contractor in total.  In this option, the Government would likely require an interface with our eligibility system and submission of payment records in accordance with the TRICARE Systems Manual available on the TMA web site.

2.  Commercial Coverage.  In this option, the Government would purchase commercial coverage from a single carrier that is equivalent to the TRICARE overseas benefit.  The contractor would propose performance standards which would become factors in the Governments award decision.  In this option, the contractor is totally at risk as the Government is simply paying a premium.

3.  Multiple Awards.  Option 3 is similar in scope to option 2 with the difference being that the Government would award a contract to every insurer/health plan meeting the Government’s minimum requirements (an essentially equivalent benefit with reasonable access standards).  Insurers would be responsible for marketing their product to eligible beneficiaries and enrolling those who elect their coverage.  The Government will pay the premium for the essentially equivalent coverage.  Any enhancements the insurer elected to market would be the beneficiary’s fiscal responsibility.

4.  Beneficiary payments.  In option 4, the Government will provide monthly cash payments to eligible beneficiaries with which they may purchase any coverage they desire.

	TMA is very interested in any comments interested parties may have about each of the above options and any ideas that may exist for other options.  We are particularly interested in the anticipated monthly premium amount, performance standards that the Government must specify, time required to prepare proposals and time required post-award to deliver services, who should assume risk and if joint risk is proposed, the risk sharing proportions, and each responders desire to enter into a contract to provide care for TRICARE beneficiaries in the Philippines.

	Please submit your comments to Mike Carroll, TRICARE Management Activity, 16401 Centretech Parkway, Aurora, CO  80011 or by email at michael.carroll@tma.osd.mil.  Please feel free to telephone Mr. Carroll with any question at (303) 676-3646.  We will consider your comments whenever received; however, we plan to make a decision on the approach within the next 30 days.  Because of this, we request your comments as soon as possible.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI) for New Optical System Technologies
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Special Projects Office (DARPA/SPO) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) on technologies enabling a large-optical system with an electronically scanned instantaneous field-of-view (FOV) over a field-of-regard (FOR) many times greater. For traditional optical designs, the FOV is inversely proportional to the optic size given a constant focal plane array. As the optic size increases for better sensitivity and/or resolution, the FOV narrows and the increased optic weight severely impacts the mechanical slew rates—with a commensurate reduction in area coverage rate.

In a large-optic system, the average time per beam position is dominated by the time required to slew and settle the optic. The current state-of-the-art for a 0.5-m optic with a 4&#61616; FOV is approximately 0.5 seconds of average time per beam position – primarily slew/settle with negligible integration time and the focal plane array (FPA) read time occurring during repositioning. This number grows to 10 seconds or more as either the optic or the FOR grows. DARPA is looking for a 20dB improvement in the average time per beam position while maintaining the sensitivity and resolution of the large-optic with the affordability of a small EO/IR focal plane. Such a system would enable a &#8805;90° FOR day/night wide-area optical GMTI search-while-track design producing high-resolution images for target identification while providing high area coverage rates for search-while-track on thousands of targets and high-revisit rates for precision tracks on tens of targets. To achieve this performance, the average time per beam position falls to approximately 5 milliseconds and is now dominated by the integration and FPA read times.

Enabling technologies may include: innovative compact optical designs; light-weight mirrors; novel electronic shutters/baffles; high-lambda, wide-bandwidth deformable mirrors; electrically or optically addressed surface coatings (i.e. suspended particle devices or phase-change materials); large/curved/inexpensive focal plane arrays; micro-mechanical cryocoolers; and novel mechanically-steered optics (silicone elastomers, carbon nanotube “muscles.”)

DARPA/SPO requests potential performers submit concepts and technologies to be considered during the formulation of the planned solicitation. DARPA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to provide compensation for the information solicited. DARPA does intend to issue a formal solicitation in FY05. Responses should be concise and clearly describe the technologies as applied to this particular problem. All submissions should be clearly marked to ensure proprietary or competition sensitive information is appropriately identified. DARPA/SPO expects all responses to be unclassified, but will accept classified responses with prior coordination. All submissions should be provided in MSWord (.doc) or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format either by e-mail or CD-ROM to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203, Attn: Tim Clark, SPO, telephone: 703-812-1975, tclark@darpa.mil.

<SUBJECT>--Industry Day Announcement - The U S Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating the Turbine/Generator upgrade of Hydropower Units at Whitney Hydropower Plant near Laguna Park, Texas
<DESC>Industry Day Announcement:  No proposals are being requested with this synopsis.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating the Turbine/Generator upgrade of Hydropower Units at Whitney Hydropower Plant, Near Laguna Park, Texas.  North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this project is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.  Small Business Size Standard for this project is $28.5 Million.  Federal Supply Code is Z211, Maintenance, Repair or Altera tion, Dams.  Purpose:  The purpose of industry day is to partner with industry to allow for a pre-final specification review and a plant tour for the purpose of reviewing the contract specifications and providing feedback in order to obtain competitive, biddable contra ct specifications and proposals once advertised.  This forum will allow contractors an opportunity to review contract plans and specifications and ask for clarification.  A requirement exists to upgrade the generating capacity to 23.3 MVA.   Contract specifications to install an upgrade to meet our requirement will be distributed to all in attendance during this event. The Whitney Hydropower Units have been approved for major rehabilitation.  The Turbine/Generator upgrade will include new turbine runners, rewound generators and new governor. Schedule:  The day of the event is scheduled 17 November, 2004 from 8:00 am  4pm at the Whitney Hydropower Plant in Texas near Laguna Park just off HWY 22 approximately 20 miles west of I35 at Hillsboro (powerhouse entrance road on west end of dam). Background/history:  The Whitney powerhouse has been operating as a peaking plant for nearly 50 years.  The peaking operation results in an average of 200 start-stops per unit per year.  On both units, the cumulative effects of age and start-stops are show ing up as a pattern of generator failures thus indicating a declining reliability.  Both of the generators have been de-rated from a design overload capability of 17.2 MW down to a maximum of 15 MW due to cumulative problems.   Whitney powerhouse is a link in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).  The demand for ERCOT power has grown on average of 3.2 percent annually from 1990 to 1999.  The peak summer demand for power increased by 3.9 percent from 1999 to 2000.  ER COT has estimated an increase 2.35 percent annually through 2009.  Therefore the risk of continued brownout or blackout from insufficient total capacity and voltage stability is increased because of less reliable equipment. Who is authorized:  All interested contractors and subcontractors.  Please limit attendance to two persons per company.  Notification of intent to attend is required by 19 October 2004.

BACKGROUND 

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates six HU-25D model aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  The HU-25D uses the Telephonics APS143 Radar System.  These aircraft are used in surveillance missions that are performed mainly over water with aircraft and communication system components being exposed to salt-laden environments.  Line Replaceable Units (LRU’s) contained within each system are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking provides, but is not limited to: an individual LRU historical record of repair and/or overhaul; tracking of component time (time since new (TSN)/time in service (TIS), time since overhaul (TSO), and mean time between failure (MTBF); component status; and physical location.

OBJECTIVE

The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center, or equivalent, to effectively repair/overhaul and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 LRU’s.  Repaired/overhauled LRU’s must meet the OEM current specifications and must perform at the system level.  Each LRU when installed shall be required to operate/interact with the other LRU’s within the Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) and Over the Horizon Airborne Sensor Information System (OASIS) without need of adjustment or degradation of system operation.  The system is also comprised of many subcomponents that provide video and power distribution to operate these LRU’s. 

The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to: trained personnel, required tooling, calibrated test equipment, FAA and/or OEM approved replacement parts, publications and documents pertaining to the LRU, preservation and shipping.

The offeror’s responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins remain incorporated upon completion of work.

Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center’s (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the chosen offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  

To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives, the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 

1.	Technical:

a.	Provide detailed work specifications for baseline repair of LRU’s.

b.	Provide a written Performance Metrics plan.

d.	Possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling, and fixtures  to meet the OEM current specifications.

e.	Provide an incentive proposal. 

f.	Provide repercussions for failure to meet Turn-Around-Time (TAT).

2.	Past Performance:
a.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like 
	items.

b.	Provide points of contact for past performance documentation for the past two years.  Include reference’s name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.

3.	Pricing:

Provide a firm-fixed price for repair of the part numbers listed above for ALL years including both Level I and Level II Repairs.

4.	Definitions:

a.	Turn around Time (TAT):  Turn around time is defined as the time item is received at vendor’s facility until item is returned to ARSC or designated Air Station.

b.	Premature Failures:  Premature failures are identified as those failures which occur during testing prior to installation or within the first 250 hours of operation.  Note:  Premature failures found to be “No Fault Found” will not be considered in the premature failure penalty clause.

c.	Level I Repair:  Test/inspect/repair as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to service requirements.

d.	Level II Repair:  Over and above a Level I Repair for units showing excessive degradation.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
