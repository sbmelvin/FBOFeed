<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Gregory Oneal, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: gregory.oneal@us.af.mil.

<DESC>NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Proposal entailing the Stitching and Weavingof Ceramic Materials.The procurement contains opportunities for the weaving of ceramic fabrics and/orpreforms, and for stitching of layers of dissimilar materials prior to, and in support ofthermal testing and research efforts under the NASA Hypersonic Project being conducted atthe NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and Langley Research Center (LaRC).Hypersonic flight and planetary entry require the development of enabling hightemperature thermal protection systems.  Many of the proposed concepts will utilize wovenceramic fabrics, non-woven ceramic fibrous insulation, woven preforms, and stitching oflayered materials using ceramic fiber tow.  While some of these utilize existing state ofthe art methods, in other configurations some method and/or process development isanticipated in working with fragile ceramic fibers.It is anticipated that constituent layers may include materials from the followingcategories: silicon carbide and oxide ceramic fiber textiles, aerogel-impregnated ceramictextiles, polyimide aerogel films, alumina paper insulators, Saffil, PyrogelTM,KaptonTM, and Kevlar reinforced Kapton laminates.  Some manufacturing development may berequired for this area. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  It isanticipated that total funding for this contract will not exceed $150,000.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) intends to execute a contract action to Rockwell Collins, 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA 52498-0001, on an other than full and open competition basis for the effort associated with non-recurring software engineering required to upgrade the current VH-3D unique cockpit avionics system architecture to a Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) for eleven (11) VH-3D aircraft, also referred to as the VH-3D Cockpit Upgrade Program (CUP). A sole source acquisition will be procured under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements." As the original equipment manufacturer and system integrator of the Common Avionics Architecture System, Rockwell Collins is the only known source with the requisite knowledge, proprietary technical data, and expertise in the Common Avionics Architecture System design and operation to meet the Navy's requirements for a common, single cockpit across all VH aircraft (VH-60Ns and VH-3Ds). A common cockpit across both VH platforms will increase safety of flight by allowing pilots and aircrew to transition between aircraft in a seamless manner, and reduce the logistics footprint in the areas of training, materials management and maintenance responsiveness. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement. The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. No phone inquiries will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing by e-mail, U.S. mail or facsimile to the attention of Kathy Camm, using the contact information provided in this synopsis. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Rockwell Collins directly.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) intends to procure and award, on an other than full and open competition basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, a Fixed Price contract with Data Physics Corporation.

The requirement is for the disassembly, inspection, replacement, fabrication, and verification of performance to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specification for a damaged Electro-Dynamic (ED) 340/4022 shaker table. The component replacement requires fabrication to fit exactly into the system structure and function as originally designed for maximum performance. 

 The ED shaker table conducts vibration test sequence which simulates the dynamic environments weapon systems are exposed to during deployment, handling, and transportation.
  A test event in 2005 using the Data Physics Electro-Dynamic (ED) 340/4022 damaged the external wiring and internal components which need replacement. 

The Government will NOT be providing financing for this procurement. Anticipated award is June 2012 and required delivery will be 10 weeks after award. This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm believing they can fulfill the requirement of providing the parts and refurbishment of the ED 340/4022 shaker table may submit a written response, which will be considered by the agency. The written response shall reference solicitation number N68936-12-R-0074 and clearly show the firms capability, background, experience, financial capability, and assets necessary to perform the required work mentioned without compromising the quality, accuracy, reliability, and performance of the ED 340/4022 shaker table.
 Written responses shall be submitted by e-mail to sheena.tang@navy.mil within 15 days from the notice date. See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA, intends to modify on a sole source basis Contract N6893609C0125 with Energy Matter Conversion (EMC2), 1202 Parkway Drive, Suite A, Santa Fe, NM 87507, to extend the period of performance and add additional tasks.  An extension and increase funding for additional tasks on Contract N68936-09-C-0125 is necessary to provide continuation of research that is directly in scope with the current requirement and it will complete the concept exploration and technology demonstration of the Plasma Wiffleball 8.  During the course of the contracted study several anomalies related to how electrons were fed into the device were discovered.
  These anomalies must be characterized and solutions created if the device is to be made functional.  To solve these anomalies, the additional effort will require the incumbent contractor to further their studies by employing independently powered electron gun arrays operating at up to 10 kilovolt (kV) to inject high energy electrons onto the Plasma Wiffleball 8 core and control the WB formation process.  Additionally, a separate pulsed power system with minimum 100 amperes current rating will be utilized to power the electron gun arrays.  This sole source acquisition is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  EMC2 is the original developer of the Plasma Wiffleball approach.  EMC2 owns the intellectual property rights to the developmental device and possesses an existing body of experience on the Plasma Wiffleball 8 that makes them uniquely and solely capable of further investigative work on the device.
  EMC2 also has a unique body of knowledge regarding the operation and performance of the Plasma Wiffleball 8, which will allow them to continue the basic research to develop an operational Plasma Wiffleball 8 device.  Continued research is critical, as the long term goal is to achieve a clean nuclear energy source for the Navy and DoD.  Award of the contract modification is expected on or about 29 March 2012.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Written responses shall be submitted by e-mail to helen.xiong@navy.mil or mailed to Commander, Code 254300D (Helen Xiong), NAVAIRWARCENWPNSDIV, 429 E. Bowen Rd. Mail Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108 within 15 days from the Notice date.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, intends to purchase AN/USQ-82(V) Gigabit Ethernet Data Multiplex System (GEDMS) hardware and INCO repair from one of two qualified vendors:  The Boeing Company or DRS Defense Solutions, LLC.
 Boeings address is 5301Bolsa Ave, Huntington Beach, CA 92647-2048. DRS address is 7600 Wisconsin Ave, Ste 1000, Bethesda, MD 20814-3657. Competition is limited to these two qualified manufacturing sources as the time and expense to qualify additional vendors is too prohibitive. GEDMS is a Government Furnished Equipment build-to-print system, where no commercially adequate products satisfy the design requirements. It is not a performance-based militarized commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) system design, although there are performance based COTS components. All items shall be in compliance with NAVSEA system specifications DMS 500.7 and GEDMS 300.0 and will be listed in the solicitation that will follow this announcement.
 Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Boeing and DRS directly. Delivery, inspection, and acceptance shall likewise be identified in the solicitation. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or around 25 May 2012 and will be open for 30 business days. Contract award will be approximately 4 September 2012. Any questions regarding this synopsis should be addressed to Candi Thomas at Candice.Thomas@navy.mil.

<DESC>Solicitation Number:SOL-NC-12-00025Notice Type: Special Notice Synopsis:
US Environmental Protection Agency Research Triangle Park Procurement Operations Division intends to issue a sole source contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
The requirement consists of purchasing a Model 633 Aethalometer for the Ambient Air Monitoring Group (AAMG), a division of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards Radiation (OAR). The AAMG develops guidance and regulations for network design, air monitoring, and operation of samplers for all criteria and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).  Inherent in its mission is the development of monitoring networks to support the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). As part of this mission, the AAMG evaluates new and improved monitoring technologies, as they become available, for implementation by monitoring agencies in routine monitoring networks. The AAMG is evaluating new semi-continuous BC monitoring technologies at the EPA on-site air monitoring station for potential use in routine monitoring applications.  The Teledyne Advanced Pollution Instrumentation Model 633 Aethalometer is the next generation of Aethal ometer that incorporates improvements and technological advancements to address limitations inherent in the previous design. The government has determined that Teledyne Advanced Pollution Instrumentation is the only source that can satisfy this agency requirement.  
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE OFFERS and a solicitation will not be issued. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this requirement would be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the award will be made without further notice. Oral communication is not acceptable in response to this notice. RESPONSES ARE DUE NOT LATER THAN March 9, 2012, 3:00 PM EST at USEPA - RTPPOD, Rodney-Daryl Jones, email: jones.rodney-daryl@epa.gov, and Bridget Findley, email: findley.bridget@epa.gov.

<CONTACT>Michael Waidelich, Contract Specialist, Email waidelichmp@state.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide local guard services at the U.S. Mission Abidjan.
<p>The Mission requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in this Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a time and materials contract, with firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable elements, for local guard services, on behalf of the U.S. Mission Abidjan. The Government will solicit this requirement as a full and open competition using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The Government plans to award one contract as a result of this acquisition.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is 622,680 hours.<br /><br />All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. The Project Manager must possess a Level 3 language proficiency, which requires an ability to speak English with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical, social, and professional topics.</p>
<p>The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: the synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days. The Government plans to post the solicitation 15 days after the synopsis. No paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals. A contract is expected to be awarded within ninety (90) days of proposal submission. All dates are subject to change.</p>
<p>A site visit is tentatively scheduled at 10:00 on March 29, 2012 at the Embassy in Abidjan. Any changes to this date will be posted on this site. All interested parties must register in order to be granted access to the U.S. Mission Abidjan.</p>
<p>The Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period opens with the posting of the synopsis and end twenty-one (21) calendar days before proposals are due. Offerors may inquire about security risks by specific countries during this period. The solicitation, when finalized, will be available on the Internet at www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>
<p>All announcements and amendments made to the solicitation will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov. To receive updates, click on "Register to Receive Notification". Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Michael Waidelich at waidelichmp@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>All proposals from responsible vendors will be evaluated if received on time. All prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the offeror who submitted a technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<DESC>This DRAFT Statement of Objectives (SOO) is for informational purposes only.  The actual solicitation will be posted in approximately 90 days.



1.0   Background

The current commercial off the shelf (COTS) mobile devices that are available on or off the Nationwide-Department of the Navy Wireless Contracts (NDWC) or the Army Air Force Blanket Purchase Agreements do not provide an approved architecture for accessing multiple enclaves (e.g., internet, Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPR), Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPR), etc.) and processing and storing sensitive information which could adversely affect national security if compromised. The National Security Agency offers a procurement method to government entities via IDIQ contracts for purchasing mobile devices capable of accessing multiple domains.
 The devices offered by these contracts do not meet the requirements listed in this solicitation. For example, the devices contain various technologies (Controlled COMSEC Item, (CCI)) that preclude them from being sold commercially. 

2.0	Purpose. 

The purpose of this procurement is to advance the development of commercial mobile device technology, beneficial to the U.S. government (i.e., DoD) by providing a capability to access multiple security domains. After completion of the period of performance, it is planned that the devices will be commercially available to the general public and to the government. 

3.0	Program Goals/Scope

The scope of this solicitation covers the Marine Corps requirements for secure mobile handheld devices.
 At the conclusion of each period of performance the contractor must deliver a multiple domain capable architecture implemented on mobile devices including the deliverables listed in the CDRLs (See exhibits A0001 through A0009). 

The following paragraphs describe the basic objectives of the trusted handheld effort and are provided in lieu of a Government Statement of Work (SOW). This approach provides offerors the flexibility to develop cost effective solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives meeting the stated objectives. It also presents the Government with an opportunity to assess the offerors understanding of all aspects of the effort to be performed by eliminating unnecessary how to instructions historically contained in a Government provided SOW.
 The government assumes the offeror will leverage their internal research and development budgets with a common understanding that the resulting technology supports much larger interests. 

4.0  Objectives 

Proposed Program Implementation. The offerors shall propose their Performance-Based approach to achieve the requirements within the performance criteria listed in the minimum and optional requirements of the solicitation. The intent of the collaborative consortium between the government and industry is to establish clear requirements and collectively influence development of mobile devices towards including mutually beneficial security characteristics. The resulting framework should help reduce cost, speed time-to-market, and reduce complexity of the devices.
 Early collaboration in the development phases should help reduce the impact of long certification processes. The goal for the resulting technology is to become a standard commercial product offered by mobile device original equipment manufacturers using the same hardware and software technologies used in commercial enterprise devices. The resulting devices must support modular additions without re-engineering or re-architecting the solutions to meet the required security controls for the high security domains. The approach(es) shall:

4.0.1  Describe the offerors approach to continually evolve the initial proposed product line into the next set of mutually beneficial mobile devices. For example, how does the offeror propose to penetrate the mobile commercial market to support broader market adoption?

4.0.2  Explain in as much detail as possible how domain separation, process isolation, and resource encapsulation is provided for the mobile device components such as the human machine interface (e.g., display and keyboard), multi-core processor, graphics processing unit, baseband processor, and the shared hardware root of trust.

4.0.3  Describe how the mobile devices security architecture embodies the security principles of modularity and simplicity.

4.1.
 Strategic Sourcing has been identified in this requirement. During the performance of the contract(s), the Government and the contractor(s) will work together, much like in a partnership, towards shared goals and objectives. The goals and objectives include:

4.1.1 Securely send voice, video, and data across multiple security domains using mobile devices without perceived degradation.

4.1.2 Mobile communications across multiple wireless networks (e.g., Personal Area Network [PAN], Wireless Local Access Netwok [WLAN], Wide Area Network [WAN]).

4.1.3 Produce secure mobile COTS devices.

4.1.4 Mobile communication interoperability with international networks.

5.0 Minimum Requirements.
 

5.1 Description. 

Exhibit (1), represents a high level description of the governments desired device architecture. Use the reference architectures described in Exhibit (1) as the framework for proposing a solution to this solicitation. The following list of requirements represents the governments minimum device characteristics. The paragraphs provide the governments rationale behind each requirement. All proposed architectures must, at an absolute minimum, include all of the following characteristics. 

5.1.1 Isolation Technology (e.g.,  separation kernel, security kernel, etc.). The isolation technology shall isolate the software components, control the intra-domain access and isolate the other resources on the devices.
 This capability is expected to support a wide range of highly sensitive security domains. The isolation technology shall provide trustworthy data paths for the user interfaces and peripherals. The base isolation technology shall be read-only to restrict after OEM build time (i.e., following the OEMs initial build). However, this will not eliminate the enterprises ability to configure the isolation technologys policy enforcement (i.e., resource interaction). The isolation technology facilitates the ability for the user to securely access information residing on different domains within the device. 

5.1.2 Multi-personality. The devices must be capable of supporting multiple personalities on a single handset.
 These personalities may manifest carrier operating systems or enterprise owned operating system. The intent is to provide a handheld device architecture that will support unmodified user managers (i.e., guest mobile operating systems) and prevent the unnecessary consumption of valuable computing resources. Example methods for obtaining multiple personalities include the use of: Advanced Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) Machine [ARM] Virtual Extensions (VE), Intel Virtualization Technology (VT), etc.
	
5.1.3 Commercial Standards. All devices must leverage commercial standards for designs and documentation (e.g., device I/O). If the devices leverage commercial standards, then parallel developments are possible with minimal interoperability conflicts.

5.1.4 Common Product Line Architecture Across Multiple Platforms.
 The proposals must address how the proposed architecture will be developed for multiple handheld devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, etc.).

5.1.5 Access to security critical code and Configuration Management (CM) systems. The government requires access to security critical code and the developers CM systems for the purposes of conducting certifications and accreditation evaluations. If necessary, the government evaluators are willing to travel to vendor site for code review. The government requires access to the above mentioned security critical code and developers CM systems no later than the delivery of the initial devices. 


5.2 Optional Capabilities

5.2.0 Description. Submitted proposals are not required to meet any optional capabilities.
 However, the optional capabilities represent the governments desire for a more secure architecture. The requirements are divided in groups based on desirability.

5.2.1 Desirable Capabilities (Most Desired)

5.2.1.1  Hardware root of trust (e.g., Trusted Platform Module[TPM]). A hardware root of trust shall be provided to facilitate secure key storage.

5.2.1.2 Trusted Boot Loader. The boot loader architecture and implementation shall provide integrity for the boot sequence. For example, the boot loader should be resistant to software attacks (e.g. jail breaking).

5.2.1.3  Multiple Active User Domains . The devices shall execute multiple user domains simultaneously with each only having access to its assigned resources.
 If this optional requirement is chosen, the domain indicator option must be implemented (i.e.,  providing the user verification of the active domain.) 

5.2.1.4  Domain Indicator . The devices shall securely indicate which domain has focus. This may be provided using an indicator separate from the primary display (i.e. , touch screen) controlled by the supervisor domain. Alternately, reserved areas of the primary display (decoration) may be used to identify the domain with focus. The preferred indicator for screen decoration is a colored border outlining the visible screen of each domain. The color of the decoration associated with each domain shall be configurable.

5.2.1.5  Advanced Software Integrity Attestation.
 In addition to the device providing medium software integrity attestation, the measurement and attestation process shall be tied to a hardware root trust such as a TPM and have the ability to perform runtime measurement and attestation. 


5.2.2 Desirable Capabilities (More Desired)

5.2.2.1 Device variations. To receive credit for this capability, the offeror shall propose and deliver at least three variations of handheld devices (i.e., smartphones, tablets, etc.). The intent is to meet different users requirements with regards to size, weight, and form factor. The devices shall include at least one device with a physical keyboard and one device without a physical keyboard (i.e., leveraging only a virtual keyboard).
 

5.2.2.2  Medium Software Integrity Attestation. The devices shall be capable of basic software integrity attestation  in addition to providing manager and application attestation. ( i.e., the device shall verify the integrity of manager and applications.)

Since the application is critical for controlling the security policy, the application shall reside in the supervisor domain.

5.2.2.4  Multi-core Processor. The devices shall use a multi-core processor. As multiple core technology begins proliferating in mobile devices, special attention needs to be given to the implementation. If the proposed solutions leverage multi-core processing, the resulting technology should help establish a baseline approach for further development.

5.2.2.5 Personality Creation Flexibility.
 The devices shall support the creation of an arbitrary number of domains and the ability to populate those domains with enterprise security solutions. 

5.2.2.6  Fail Secure. The devices shall provide fail secure operation so that events that can result in unauthorized inter-domain data flows shall stop current operations and restart the devices or load a designated domain image. This must protect against unauthorized release of, or access to, sensitive information.

5.2.2.7 Fail for Availability. The devices shall provide fail for availability operation. The purpose is to allow corrupted virtual machines to restart. The devices shall have the ability to load master images when the guest images are corrupted.
 For example, if the environment within the guest image is corrupted and fails to operate,  the device will restart and load the master image. 

5.2.2.8 Memory Sanitization. The devices shall provide the ability to overwrite any physical location in flash memory. To meet this requirement the proposal must describe the overwrite capability and any involvement of bad block management and wear leveling mechanisms.

5.2.2.1.4 Domains other than the Supervisor Domain. Integrity checks shall be performed as those domains are loaded.

5.2.3.2 External Cryptography. The devices shall support external cryptography. For example, with external cryptography functionality, the user could insert a secure digital (SD) card with an embedded microprocessor to facilitate an encryption capability independent of the inherent processors. The intent of this requirement is to facilitate data-at-rest and data-in-transit encryption for access to highly sensitive networks.

5.2.3.3 Suite B Cryptography.
 The devices shall contain the ability to encrypt data with a FIPS 140-2 and NSA certified implementation. The intent is to enable the devices to process sensitive data on U.S. Government networks.

5.2.3.4 Protected Storage. The devices shall provide data-at rest-protection for the domains. This may be accomplished through whole disk encryption, file system encryption, and OS image encryption. The selection of key, algorithm, and storage location shall be selectable per domain (e.g., hardware root of trust, Suite B SD microprocessor, or installed SD card). 

5.2.3.5 Carrier aware dual personalities. The devices shall support multiple network personalities. The devices shall be configurable to assign the carrier identification information to different domains.
 For example, the devices could be equipped with a personal Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) and a business SIM where the personal SIM is paid for by the consumer, and the business SIM is paid for by the organization. Additionally, this facilitates the ability for the carrier identification information to support network authentication. For example, personal domain accesses network via personal SIM credentials and business domain access network via business SIM credentials).

5.2.3.6 Messaging . The devices shall provide message transport between supervisor and user domains. This shall include security relevant event messages  originating from the isolation technology layer . Any message presented to user must be capable of being stored and accessible within an audit log.

5.2.3.7  Sideloading.
 The devices shall be capable of loading software and data through external interfaces. This provides the capability of loading software and data locally vice over- the-air.

5.2.3.8  Auditing. The devices shall be capable of auditing security relevant events (e.g., boot events, fail secure events, configuration changes, etc.). The devices shall protect the audit trail, provide a means of exporting the audit trail from the devices, and a means of clearing the audit trail. Understanding comprehensive internal auditing can monopolize the devices resources, the offerors must distinguish where each audit function will occur (i.e., internal to the device or in the enterprise).

6.0 Definitions

<DESC>XM25 Individual Semi-Automatic Airburst System (ISAAS) Force on Force Training Simulation System<br><br>The US Army Product Manager Individual Weapons (PM IW) is conducting a market investigation to identify possible sources for a training simulation system. This system may be used in force on force training, and shall have the capability of simulating airburst effects of the XM25 ISAAS. <br><br>The XM25 weapon system enables the small unit and individual Soldier to engage defilade (protected position provided by an obstacle) targets by providing a 25mm air bursting capability that can be used in all operational environments. <br><br>The ISAAS is a direct-fire, semi-automatic, shoulder fired, man portable weapon system, which consists of three major subsystems:  <br><br>(1) Target Acquisition/Fire Control (TA/FC) <br>(2) weapon<br>(3) 25mm airburst ammunition. <br><br>An individual Soldier employing basic rifle marksmanship skills can effectively engage exposed or defilade targets in seconds. The system allows the individual Soldier to quickly and accurately engage targets by producing an adjusted aimpoint based on range, environmental factors, and user inputs. <br><br>The target acquisition/fire (TA/FC) control integrates thermal capability with direct -view optics, laser rangefinder, compass, fuze setter, ballistic computer, and an internal display. The TA/FC utilizes a full ballistic algorithm to calculate an adjusted aimpoint that facilitates accurate placement of the high explosive airburst (HEAB) ammunition on target.<br><br>The proposed force on force simulation training system must already be in production or consist of components that are NDI and/or COTS since this effort will only consist of integration and test phases It is anticipated that integration effort of the proposed training simulation system will take approximately nine (9) months and the test effort will take no more than six (6) months. <br><br>Two (2) sets of training simulation systems may be purchased for a government conducted test and evaluation program. The contractor is required to provide hardware support during the testing. The proposed training solution must be interoperable with the current Modular Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES).  <br><br>This market survey is a Request for Information (RFI) only; this is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), a Request for Proposal (RFP), or a solicitation. No solicitation document exists. <br><br>All interested firms, foreign and domestic, and regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this RFI. Any response to this market survey shall not exceed 20 pages. Interested firms should submit their information no later than 30 March 2012 to the either the following:<br><br>E-Mail Address: Andrew.C.Mitchell1.civ@mail.mil<br>                Andrew Mitchell, Army Contracting Command (ACC) Aberdeen Proving <br>                Ground (APG) Contract Specialist<br><br>Street Address: Army Contracting Command (ACC) Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG)<br>                4310 Boothby Hill Road, Bay 2<br>                Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD<br>                21015-3013<br><br>Any and all information submitted will be at no cost to the Government.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) pending the availability of funds for competitive proposals resulting in awards of separate contracts for Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), formerly known as Peer Review Organizations (PROs) for the States of Maine, Vermont, Idaho, Texas and the Territory of Virgin Islands. In order to be eligible to receive a QIO contract, an Offeror must: 1) satisfactorily demonstrate physician-sponsorship or physician access as defined in Sections 1152 and 1153 of the Act at the time its proposal is submitted; 2) must meet the definition of a utilization and quality control peer review organization as set forth in Section 1152 of the Social Security Act (the Act); and 3) be deemed a responsible entity in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 9.1. In addition, an Offeror must not be a health care facility, health care facility association, health care facility affiliate or payor organization; and must have a consumer representative on its governing board. QIOs are responsible for review of certain health care services furnished under Title XVIII of the Act in addition to working to improve the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Each QIO is responsible for meeting all requirements as defined in the RFP and resultant contract. The period of performance will be for three (3) years. The RFP is anticipated to be released on the Federal Business Opportunities website within the next two to three weeks. Telephone or facsimile requests for the RFP will not be honored. CMS will host a Conference on March 28, 2011 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (local prevailing time-Baltimore, MD) to discuss the recently released Draft 10th Statement of Work (Fed Biz Opps Special Notice Number CMS3411). The 10th Statement of Work Conference may be accessed by telephone, webinar, and in person. Further details concerning the Conference will be forthcoming in a separate posting on this website under this Solicitation Number. Offerors are further informed that in an earlier Federal Register announcement (FR Doc. 2010-28817 Filed 11-24-10; 8:45 am) published on November 24, 2010, CMS informed industry of the states in which there are no "In-State" QIOs. The current states where there are no "In-State" QIOs are: Maine, Vermont and Idaho. Offerors should note that the State of South Carolina was also named in this FR announcement but was included in error. To qualify as an "In-State" QIO, an organization must meet the definition of Section 1153(i)(3) of the Act which provides that an "In-State" organization is an organization that has its primary place of business in the State in which review will be conducted (or, which is owned by a parent corporation the headquarters of which is located in such state). In addition to meeting the previously stated eligibility requirements, Offerors electing to submit proposals for the States of Maine, Vermont and Idaho must also be deemed to have "In-State" status according to the Act. In the event there are no qualified "In-State" QIOs eligible to respond to the RFP for the States of Maine, Vermont and Idaho, CMS will only consider proposals from the QIOs who currently hold the 9th SOW contract for these states. For the State of Texas and the Territory of Virgin Islands, Offerors must meet the eligibility requirements of responsibility, physician-sponsorship or physician-access and may or may not be an "In-State" organization.

<SUBJECT>DTRA Agile Acquisition Framework (AAF) Development & Support

<RESPDATE>030812
<CONTACT>Eric M. Rode, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-767-3496, Email Eric.Rode@dtra.mil
<DESC><p>Synopsis: This is a sources sought notice and synopsis announcement. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this request for information (RFI). No response will be provided for requests for a solicitation. This sources sought notice is published to assist the Government for market research purposes only. The Government will not reimburse contractors for any costs associated with responding to this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>Description: The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) is seeking to transform elements of the legacy acquisition framework at the agency through a standardized solution architecture and an agile acquisition framework approach that will assist DTRA with critical infrastructure, mission, and modernization efforts. Currently within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), there is a lack of an integrated approach for Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) requirements, assessments, and acquisitions that results in large process, time, and cost overheads. The OCIO has determined that an Agile Acquisition Framework (AAF) will assist DTRA in consolidating duplicative infrastructure requirements, improving transparency in decision making, leveraging market innovations (Government Off The Shelf (GOTS)/COTS/Open-Source), providing traceability across the entire acquisition lifecycle, and by engaging external knowledge areas of expertise from partnerships with Industry and Academia.</p>
<p>DTRA is requesting expertise to leverage the communities of practice to improve the organization's long term information technology (IT) investment decisions through: a) consistent and responsible business &amp; mission case development for acquisitions; b) tracking and trending critical IT performance metrics and management for the acquisition life cycle; and c) the application of proven COTS/GOTS/Open-Source assessments, testing, implementation, and analytics.</p>
<p>DTRA is seeking a proven acquisition life cycle assessment framework to transform the current technical assessment and acquisition practices into repeatable, executable, and measurable disciplines that will result in objective outcomes based on strategic decision-making with regard to IT investment and integration.</p>
<p>Requirements:<br />1. Acquisition Agility: DTRA is seeking a streamline acquisition process to maximize the use of commercial enterprise innovation. This agile framework should provide a means for minimizing over specification, custom development, and proprietary infrastructure fabrics.<br />2. Increase Technical Innovation: DTRA would like to establish public/private information exchanges that enable greater access to non-traditional suppliers and innovations in the marketplace; while also leveraging existing sources of IT assessment evidence, testing, and implementation results.<br />3. Information Assurance (IA): DTRA needs to address security requirements at all stages of the acquisition lifecycle; to include, IA requirements, architecture engineering, technical assessments, and procurement processes.<br />4. Decision Analytics: DTRA needs to enable effective program management and Value Stream Analysis to address the human and cultural challenges inherent in government decision making. A valuable Decision Analytics system would enable DTRA to frame the essence and success criteria of each phase in the acquisition lifecycle to bring focus to high risk program areas and reduce analysis/paralysis.<br />5. Business/Mission Case Analysis: DTRA is seeking a more effective method to demonstrate the business/mission value of technology investments, based on evidence-based research and lifecycle costs, as required in the Clinger Cohen Act.<br />6. Portfolio Management: DTRA would like to assess to what degree existing infrastructure services, technologies and platforms can be reconfigured into new Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).</p>
<p>Scope and Timeframe: The estimated period of performance for the contract is approximately 6 months from contract award.</p>
<p>Location: Work will principally be performed at the Defense Threat Reduction Center at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia.</p>
<p>Capabilities Statement: Sources sought responses shall reflect corporate information and a capability summary reflecting experience related to the above areas. Responses are to be limited to a capabilities sheet of no more than 1 page. Company information should include qualifications and experience in work of this nature, point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, business size, and small business classification (8a, HUBZone, etc.) if applicable. Non-profit organizations must also indicate size (small business or large business). You should also indicate if your company is currently providing services under any DoD or federal contract including GSA Schedule for the services described above. If your company is currently performing similar services for the government, please include the applicable contract number. Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice is strictly voluntary. This synopsis is for information planning purposes only and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.</p>
<p>All documentation and statements received shall become the property of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available. Requests for the same will be disregarded. There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this Sources Sought Notice.

The term of the permit is five (5) years, with an additional five (5) years that may be awarded non-competitively upon satisfactory completion of the original term. At the end of the second 5-year period the permit will automatically terminate and a new permit may be issued through a competitive process. Additional revenue generating opportunities through the sale of specific items may be proposed.<br /><br />The prospectus includes 45 family campgrounds, two group loops in campgrounds, and four day use sites/areas located on Grand Valley, Gunnison, Ouray and Norwood Ranger Districts in west-central Colorado. The Forest Headquarters is located in Delta, Colorado with District offices in Grand Junction, Paonia, Gunnison, Montrose and Norwood.<br /><br />The Final Prospectus, Sample Operating Plan and other appendices are now available.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SEEKING POTENTIAL  INTEREST AND USE OF NASA LANGLEY RESEARCHCENTER UNIQUE CAPABILITIES IN STRUCTURES AND MATERIALS 1-PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE AND REQUEST: NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) seeks to enhance the use of the Centers distinctivelab and facility capabilities to support government and commercial aerospace activities. We believe the extraordinary resources available at NASA Langley, including facilities,labs and human capital, can be of great benefit to the nation and enhance technologydevelopment and infusion. The purpose of this RFI is to engage partners in dialogueleading to collaborative R&D efforts that enhance utilization of NASA Langleycapabilities by industry, universities and other government agencies.  The expectation isthat NASA LaRC will be reimbursed for all costs incurred.  Our first step inaccomplishing this purpose will be to  assess interest regarding the  LaRC labs andfacilities that have the greatest opportunities to expand partnerships, customer base andeconomic opportunities consistent with the NASA mission.We seek responses from organizations outlining potential collaborative efforts on areimbursable basis to utilize the Center expertise, labs and facilities, hereafterreferred to as capabilities in the area of Structures and Materials.	It is this areaof R&D where Langley leads NASA efforts in its various mission areas, especially indevelopment of advanced aircraft and space systems and vehicles. This capability hasbroad application within the aerospace industry, but also potentially in many other areasof commerce. 2-UNIQUE NASA CAPABILITIESLangleys Structures and Materials capabilities include a full range of aerospacematerials and structures research and development activities.  These capabilitiesinclude: -developing game changing new materials at the molecular level;-research into understanding the material properties; - integration of those materials into novel new structural designs such as inflatablestructures;- design of subsystems and complete systems for aircraft and space flight vehicles; -research and development of new advanced manufacturing techniques; - rapid prototyping and fabrication of components and systems for aircraft andspaceflight vehicles; -structural, thermal vacuum and environmental testing of those components and vehicles;-development of tools and techniques such as methods for advanced nondestructiveevaluation and health monitoring of flight systems during missions.	 The core capabilities/competencies managed at the Center that are essential to Structuresand Materials are: 2.1.	   Advanced materials synthesis and processing  the full range of materialsdevelopment, from developing revolutionary new multifunctional materials with superiorproperties to developing and employing new high tech manufacturing capabilities2.2.

Aeroelasticity and unsteady aerodynamics  understanding the inflight effectsof air flow on the structural aerospace systems2.7.	   Systems engineering and Integration (SE&I) - All aspects of SE&I such asrequirements definition, design, structural and thermal analysis, fabrication,integration, and environmental testing for ground and flight validation of advancedtechnologies and vehicle systems. Major physical assets and equipment required to provide Structures and Materials corecapabilities and services to meet mission requirements are: 	James H. Starnes  Structures and Material Lab	Materials Research Lab	Thermal Structure Lab	Subscale Impact Dynamics Lab	Structural Dynamics Lab	Landing and Impact Research (LandIR) Facility	Combined Loads Test System (COLTS) Facility	Nondestructive Evaluation Sciences Labs	Multiparameter Lab	Light Alloy Lab	Composites Processing Lab	Composites and Polymer Lab	Environmental Test Facilities (Clean Rooms, Thermal-Vac Chambers, VibrationTables, and Electromagnetic Interference and Compatibility)	Fabrication Facilities	Mid Range Computing Facilities   More details of each Structures and Material Capability are described in the NASALangley Research Center Capabilities of Structures, Materials, and Non-DestructiveEvaluation Facilities and Laboratories documents which are available at http://procurement.larc.nasa.gov/RFI.htmlOur intent is to engage with potential partners to make available, on a reimbursablebasis, NASA LaRCs facilities and expert NASA Science and Engineering staff tocollaboratively conduct work. We will jointly define potential R&D efforts, developmutually agreed to statements of work, cost, and schedule as defined in a reimbursableSpace Act Agreement (SAA).  See Section 4 for a description of Space Act Agreements.We anticipate some respondents may be interested in only one area or sub-area whileothers may be interested in broad efforts requiring more than one capability.	Someorganizations may want to partner because of their direct needs, or there may berespondents who wish to utilize LaRC support to meet needs of third parties.  Suchactivities can be accommodated utilizing the SAA vehicle, either for a single project(SAA) or for a group of projects (umbrella SAA), consistent with the NASA missionBased on the type and quality of responses, NASA Langley expects to engage selectedorganization(s) in further discussions regarding expanded partnerships, customer base and economic opportunities consistent with the NASA mission.  Although no site visits arecurrently planned, LaRC may consider scheduling a site visit to NASA LaRC Structures andMaterials related labs and facilities to foster additional dialog pertaining to anyproposed partnerships.	  3-INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM RESPONDENTSGiven the description of capabilities defined in the area of Structures and Materials, weare seeking information on potential partnership opportunities. As expressed earlier, weanticipate a range of responses from limited use to extensive use, and short duration tolong term use of NASA facilities and staff.  In either case, please provide summaries ofyour interest(s), assuming details would be further refined through discussions with NASAmanagers/technical staff.  Interested parties shall submit statements of interest electronically, via e-mail, to theRFI General Point of Contact (POC) listed below. The statement of interest should notexceed two (2) pages.  Responses should use a minimum font size of 12. To facilitate aprompt review, the statement of interest should clearly identify the specific LaRCcapability of interest and the following four (4) elements:1.  Provide a summary of your proposed R&D effort, including areas of capability needed.2.  Outline the responsibilities of each party (NASA and partners).  If you are proposinga broad use or long term use of capabilities, or work to satisfy third party needs,describe the volume of work (work years) expected and for whom, if 3rd parties areinvolved. If multiple projects are proposed, estimate the work volume per project (workyears) and the number of projects per year.  3.  Provide your desired schedule in terms of start date and duration of work.	4.  Identify that you are a U.S. domestic entity.  If not, identify the country in whichyour company or organization is incorporated or legally formed or organized. 4- NASAs REIMBURSABLE AGREEMENTS PROCESSUnder the authority of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (Space Act), 51 USC20113(e), NASA is authorized to enter into and perform contracts, leases cooperativeagreements or other transactions necessary in the conduct of its work  on such terms asit deems appropriate.	NASA engages in reimbursable work using Space Act Agreements(SAAs).  This authority is implemented by NASA Policy Directive (NPD) 1050.1 (availableat http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPD&c=1050&s=1I) , Authority to Enterinto Space Act Agreements, which identifies organizational responsibilities, mandatorylegal provisions, delegation of signatory authority and other requirements.  It can befound on the NASA website.  In addition, NASA Advisory Implementing Instruction (NAII)1050.1, Space Act Agreement Guide (available athttp://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/NPD_attachments/NAII_1050_1B.doc, contains detailedinstructions and clauses to be used in various types of SAAs, depending on the type ofpartner entering into the agreement with NASA, and the work to be performed.  It also islocated on the NASA website.  Generally, work under an SAA needs to align with the NASAmission unless the facilities being used are underutilized NASA resources.  In thosecases NASA goods, services and facilities that are not being fully used to accomplishmission requirements may be used by private firms.  However, such use is subordinate toNASA mission work, but that can usually be accommodated through scheduling.  In addition,it is Government policy that any private use of NASA resources will not compete withreasonably available U.S. private sector resources.  Work is performed on a reasonableefforts basis.  Each agreement will contain clear milestones, have defined financialcommitments, allocate intellectual property rights and address liability and risk ofloss, as well as containing a dispute resolution mechanism and a fixed end date for theSAA.  Agreements generally cannot exceed five years in duration.  They may be singleundertakings covering a specific task, or they may be Umbrella Agreements which spell outthe terms that will apply to Annexes.  Annexes address specific tasks to be performedthat are within the scope of the Umbrella SAA.If you desire to utilize NASA resources ona reimbursable basis, NASA assigns a point of contact to understand the work to beperformed and the schedule.  NASA will generate an estimate of the cost to be reimbursed,which is included in the SAA.  Payments are made in advance of work because NASA cannotperform reimbursable work in advance of funding.  The point of contact will generate theSAA document which will be provided to the partner for its review and comment.	Onceagreement is reached, the agreement is signed by authorized personnel for NASA and thepartner.  An agreements manager at LaRC retains the executed document for NASAs records,and the partner also retains a copy.  5- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The purposeof this RFI is to determine industrys level of interest in the LaRC capabilitiesaddressed above. Additional information, if forthcoming, will be synopsized in the NASAAcquisition Internet Service (NAIS) and FedBizOps. It is the responsibility of potentialusers to monitor NAIS for the release of any additional information or synopsis. This RFIis not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay forany information solicited. Since this is a RFI, no evaluation letters and/or results willbe issued to the respondents. 6- RESPONSE DATE:Responses are required no later than COB on the response date specified above. Information received after this date will only be considered if deemed in theGovernments best interest. Please reference this RFI, RFI-LARC-RLC-01, in anyresponse.

<DESC>Request for Information:
  
VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System (VASNHS) is implementing a model of patient-centered care.  At the core of patient-centered care is an entirely new approach to healthcare that shifts the current system, which is problem-based disease care, to one that is patient-centered health and healing.  It requires a process that is proactive rather than reactive, and engages the patient at the center of their care. There are three key components to this approach to healthcare: personalized health planning; whole person, integrative strategies; and behavior change and skill building that works.  This is accomplished by aligning and integrating ongoing initiatives, and building new skills and capacities within our existing work force.

VASNHS is seeking to implement a program that that provides various alternatives to patient-centered health and healing, such as, but is not limited to: acupuncture, chiropractic, tai chi, reiki, massage, other complementary therapies, etc.  

Any interested organization should submit a written capability statement to include its experience in developing and implementing a whole-person wellness program, an overview of the program, and any additional information on related services your organization may offer.  Please do not submit any proprietary information in your capability statement.

Capability statements shall not exceed 10 pages readable in Microsoft Word 2007 and must be submitted via e-mail to Tamara Feist-Hatfield, Contract Specialist, tamara.feist-hatfield@va.gov no later than Friday, March 2 2012. Only e-mail electronic submissions will be accepted.

Responses to this RFI will be treated as information only and will be considered as part of the Government's market research efforts.

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.

<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business concern; (2) whether they are small business; HUBZone small business; service-disabled, veteran-owned small business; 8(a) small business; veteran-owned small business; woman-owned small business; or small disadvantage business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this project is 541990.<br />The small business size standard is $7.0 million in annual receipts.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) began work in China because of the unparalleled scientific opportunity to study esophageal cancer. The extraordinary rates of disease in Linxian (20-25% of deaths are due to this disease) coupled with the numerous documented nutritional inadequacies made this an ideal place to test the hypothesis that nutritional supplements could prevent cancer. Both esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric cardia cancer (GCC) occur at epidemic rates in this population, share some etiologic risk factors, and prior to widespread use of endoscopy and biopsy, were diagnosed as a single disease referred to as "esophageal cancer" or "hard of swallowing disease".</p>
<p>Enabled by the establishment of a cancer field station in Linxian by the Chinese in the late 1950s and the opening of China to the West in the 1970s, NCI initiated collaborative studies of esophageal cancer with the Cancer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CICAMS) in 1982. Pilot studies were followed by a case-control study and the Nutrition Intervention Trials (NITs).</p>
<p>With the conclusion of the NIT interventions in 1991, attention turned to the etiology and the early detection of Upper Gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers, where studies were started in members of the trial cohorts as well as other high-risk and diseased subjects in Linxian. These studies have been conducted over the years through 2 separate but overlapping projects: the Nutrition Intervention Trials and Follow-up Study, and the Early Detection of Esophageal Cancer (EDEC) Project. These previously separate projects are now being combined into a single project to gather data and information related to participants of UGI cancer in Linxian.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The primary objective of this project is to identify and test strategies to reduce mortality from esophageal and gastric cancer in Linxian China.</p>
<p>Project requirements</p>
<p>Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following:</p>
<p>1. Continued follow-up of participants previously enrolled in Linxian studies: a) Follow-up the Nutrition Intervention Trials (NIT) participants (n=32,902) and all prior participants in the Early Detection of Esophageal Cancer (EDEC) Project (n=4000) cohorts for vital and cancer endpoints, b) Determine updated vital status and cancer status data on all NIT and EDEC by monthly checks of village doctor records and quarterly checks of Linxian Cancer Registry records; c) Identify, and store centrally all available diagnostic materials for NIT and EDEC participants identified as having developed cancer or died with cancer; d) Review diagnostic materials and summarize all causes of mortality and all incident and mortal cancers diagnosed; e) Quality control: Develop and implement, as a part of the project plan, quality control methods to assure high quality in the collection, preparation, and review of vital status and cancer status information.</p>
<p>2. Maintain biorepository of existing samples: a) Store biological samples at -85 degrees Centigrade or room temperature (as appropriate), all existing biologic samples collected during the NIT and EDEC projects in the Linxian biorepository, and monitor the freezer and ambient temperatures in the freezer storage room daily; b) Develop/maintain an inventory of biologic samples in the Linxian biorepository; c) From the Linxian biorepository, transport biologic samples, in accordance with appropriate regulations, as needed to NCI or other designated laboratory for specified laboratory analyses; e) Quality control: Develop and implement, as a part of the project plan, quality control methods to assure high quality in the processing and storage of biologic samples.</p>
<p>3. Initial and Final Transition Plan: a) Ensure the orderly, efficient and safe transition of all contract activities and biological materials within a pre-determined period of time.</p>
<p>As part of the work under this potential contract quarterly and final technical report are expected.</p>
<p>Other important considerations</p>
<p>This work requires the Contractor to provide responses to data inquiries generated by the COR in response to data received from China.</p>
<p>This work requires the Contractor to prepare, in collaboration with the COR, reports from study data for publication.</p>
<p>All biological materials delivered will need to be packaged in appropriate containers and delivered according to Department of Transportation regulations.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is one year, with four one-year options.</p>
<p>Capability statement/information sought.<br />Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability<br />statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all<br />attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space using a 12-point font<br />size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice<br />described above. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement, as well as the eligible small business concern's name, point of contact, address and DUNS number.</p>

Additional NAICS 237130  Power and Communication Line and Related Structures Construction, also applies to this REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.

AGENCY:  Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific

ACTION:  Issue a Request for Information (RFI) seeking renewable ocean energy technology providers to participate in a Renewable Ocean Energy Conference to be held at Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH), Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, to facilitate development of new energy technology resources for coastal Navy and Marine Corps installations.
 

SUMMARY:  Companies are invited to attend a two-day Renewable Ocean Energy Conference to be held at MCBH, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, on March 26, 2012 and March 28, 2012 at the Koa Malina Officers Club, from 7:00 a.m. HST to 4:30 p.m. HST.  The Conference will provide an opportunity for ocean energy technology developers/suppliers to discuss testing/installing/operating systems at coastal Navy and Marine Corps installations.  The first day of the conference will be the Wave Energy Test Site (WETS) Industry Forum and will focus on wave energy initiatives at MCBH, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.  The second day of the Conference will be for the Ocean Energy and Sea Water Air Conditioning (SWAC) Industry Forum and will cover the broad spectrum of renewable ocean energy technologies, including offshore wind, ocean thermal energy conversion, wave, tidal, current, and ocean compressed air energy storage, with an emphasis on implementing SWAC systems.
  
The RFI and Industry Forums will facilitate Department of Navy (DoN) market research for future energy projects.  Data and responses received will allow DoN to assess wave energy device company interest in testing wave energy conversion (WEC) systems at the Navys Wave Energy Test Site (WETS), located at MCBH, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.  It will solicit commercialization plans of ocean energy technology companies to assist DoN with resourcing potential future DoN energy suppliers and will explore the potential to incorporate SWAC systems at appropriate coastal Naval facilities.  The ultimate objective of this effort is to support development and utilization of ocean energy technologies as a means to reduce dependence on fossil fuel and associated emissions.

DAY 1.
 WAVE ENERGY TESTING.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Engineering Service Center (NAVFAC ESC) would like to assess interest in testing WEC devices at the Navys WETS located at MCBH, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.
 
This RFI is to initiate the process of examining and evaluating prospective developers interested in deploying prototype WEC devices at a 30m water depth site or one of the two future deep water sites at WETS. 
   
Each WEC device company responding to this RFI shall prepare a package that provides answers to the technical questions posed, and includes substantial additional detail regarding research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) efforts that have already been undertaken to support their path to successful commercialization.
  NAVFAC ESC will assess the technical maturity of various types of WEC devices based on these submittals (i.e., data and information regarding device suitability for WETS, power output, test history, technical approach to planning the deployment, operations, and maintenance scenarios, device interactions with the environment, technical publications and reports, and cost-sharing plans). At the industry forum, companies will receive additional WETS-specific data, and have the opportunity to participate in a question and answer session that will provide a more thorough understanding of the overall WETS framework and design efforts to date.
  
The Navy may choose to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) pursuant to 15 U.S.C.
 3710a with selected WEC developers authorizing the WEC developer to test its device at WETS.  The WEC developer will be required to secure financing for device planning, installation, maintenance, testing, removal and reporting.  The Navy will provide three mooring anchors, the subsea power cable to shore (with a dry mate-able end connector at sea), the shore station office space and grid connection.  Those companies not initially selected to participate in the first test round of CRADA testing may remain eligible for future testing.  For additional details see RFI paragraph 1.0, DON Wave Energy Test Site.

DAY 2. EMERGING OCEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES FOR NAVAL FACILITIES.
  
The Navy seeks to better understand the commercialization plans of all ocean energy technology developers and to evaluate the impact such systems may have on future DoN Energy usage.
  The Navy will gather data on projections, business plans, system readiness and energy costs from emerging technology.  The Navy seeks to understand the process required to prepare such systems for commercial application.

The Navy seeks to gather information from suppliers regarding the implementation of seawater air conditioning systems at coastal Naval facilities to help achieve Navy energy reduction and renewable energy goals.  The Navy desires projected cost and energy savings data using this technology.  For additional details see RFI paragraph 2.0, Ocean Energy for Naval Facilities.

<SOLNBR>W912DY-11-R-0036
<RESPDATE>072811
<CONTACT>Sarah M. Tierney, 256-895-1219

<a href="mailto:sarah.m.tierney@usace.army.mil">USACE HNC, Huntsville</a>
<DESC>In support of the Army Energy Initiatives Office, the U.S. Army Engineering & Support Center in Huntsville, Alabama seeks developers for large scale, renewable and alternative energy production on or near Army installations.  <br><br>1. Contract Information: The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville (CEHNC), Alabama intends to solicit and award multiple, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts for use in competing and awarding Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) task orders.  The product/service will be the delivery of renewable and alternative energy for Army use that is produced on or near Army installations by production facilities that are financed, constructed, operated and maintained by the contractor. The length of contract for the sale of the energy to the Army cannot exceed 30 years.  The task order and accompanying lease agreement will specify what is to become of the contractor-owned energy plant at the end of the contract term if no follow-on PPA or lease agreement extension. These contracts are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The task order awards in excess of 10 year terms are conditional to project approval by OSD in accordance with 10 U.S.C.   2922a- Procurement of energy systems using renewable forms of energy. The Government is performing market research in order to determine which businesses, large and small, possess the interest and capability to execute the requirements of this anticipated request for proposal (RFP).  <br><br>Interested sources should respond to the questions presented within this announcement in order to facilitate the Government's market research efforts.  The Government will analyze all responses and determine if the pool of qualified and interested small business firms is significant enough for a total set-aside competition restricted to small businesses or for a partial set-aside competition restricted to small businesses.  If the determination is made that there are not enough qualified and/or interested small business firms to perform this requirement, the Government may solicit the acquisition as an unrestricted full and open competition.  The Government does not intend to rank submittals or provide any reply to interested firms.  <br><br>The Army seeks to achieve energy security and meet its renewable energy mandates through the use of large scale renewable energy projects and the attainment of net zero energy status by its installations.  The Army must consume or produce 25% of the electric it purchases by 2025.  In addition it must attain a reduction of 34% of its green house gas emissions from 2008 levels by 2020.  In addition, the Net Zero Energy initiative challenges installations to produce more energy on the installation than they consume, with emphasis on the use of renewable energy and alternative fuels.  Since not all Army installations have the resources, land and availability to the national electrical grid to develop large scale renewable energy projects, some installations are challenged to develop more production capacity than they require in order to allow the Army to achieve its targets and mandates.<br><br>The planned contracts described in this announcement will not be the only contract vehicles utilized to achieve the net zero energy goal, but they are anticipated to be frequently used.  Multiple award ID/IQ contracts are anticipated to be awarded in 2013 with a minimum of one (1) year base period and a minimum of four (4) one-year option periods for a total ordering period of at least five (5) years during which to compete for PPA task orders. However, individual task orders awarded during that time frame may extend up to 30 years. The programmatic value of all task orders awarded under all of the ID/IQ contracts is $5 billion ($5B).  Individual task orders are anticipated to range from $50 million to $900 million each.  All of these dollar figures refer to the initial project investment cost to produce the renewable or alternative energy supply.      <br><br>2. Project Information: The requirements include solar, wind, geothermal and bio-mass renewable energy (RE) projects and may include alternative energy sources that do not qualify as renewable but offer improvements or benefits in terms of greenhouse gas reductions, reduced overall energy costs and/or improved energy security. The basic contracts will establish a pool of pre-qualified offerors to compete for PPA task orders. It is anticipated that this acquisition will consist of separate pools of ID/IQ awards, one for each of the four RE technology areas, i.e., solar, wind, geothermal and bio-mass. Firms will be able to compete and win contracts in multiple RE technology areas. The geographic scope of these contracts will be 50 states, District of Columbia, U.S. Territories and the Republic of Marshall Islands. The structure of the basic contract competitive pools may change when the Intent to Issue a Request for Proposal is published.     <br><br>3. Submission Requirements: This sources sought announcement is unrestricted to allow small and large businesses to respond. The Government is seeking to identify qualified sources either singularly or as part of an assembled team under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 22119 Electric power generation (except fossil fuel, hydroelectric, nuclear) and 237130, Alternative energy (e.g., geothermal, ocean wave, solar, wind) structure construction. NAICS 237130 also includes co-generation plant, nuclear plant and electric power transmission line and tower construction.<br><br>Interested firms should submit a document describing relevant demonstrated experience and qualifications via email to sarah.m.tierney@usace.army.mil and tonju.l.butler@usace.army.mil no later than 28 July 2011 in the following format:  Submissions should not exceed ten- 8.5 inches x 11 inches pages (five pages if printed two-sided).  The submission should address all questions in the sources sought questionnaire below and your ability to perform the work, obtain the necessary financing, etc., as stated in the contract information section of this sources sought.  <br><br>In addition to submitting a response to the sources sought questionnaire, interested firms are invited to review the attached draft scope of work and provide comments.  There is no specified page limit or format for feedback on the draft scope.<br><br>This synopsis is for market research purposes only and is not a request for proposal (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.  <br><br>No hard copy of facsimile submissions will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a sole-source synopsis that provides notification of the 30th Contracting Squadron's intent to extend contract FA4610-08-D-0004, 8(a) Grounds Maintenance, for a period of six months. The period of performance for this extension will be from 01 October 2012 through 31 March 2013. This extension is needed to satisfy the 30th Space Wing's (30SW) Grounds Maintenance requirement until award of Grounds Maintenance solicitation FA4610-12-R-0010 can be completed. Not awarding a six-month extension would cause serious injury to the Government. The extension will be performed by the incumbent contractor, Prestige Maintenance, 2350 S Midwest Blvd. Ste 4, Midwest City, OK 73110-5805. A competitive 8(a) set-aside was awarded on 01 January 2008 to provide Grounds Maintenance for the 30SW, Vandenberg AFB, CA. The 8(a) Grounds Maintenance contractor provides all management, tools, supplies, equipment, materials, and labor necessary to insure grounds maintenance services are properly performed on Vandenberg AFB in support of the 30th Civil Engineer Squadron (30 CES). The extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted services of the Vandenberg AFB operations described above. This six-month extension of services is accomplished pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements," as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This notice is being posted since this option under FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, was not previously evaluated as part of the initial contract award for FA4610-08-D-0004. This option exercise will be at the current rates specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8. This option exercise will further allow for the current procurement under FA4610-12-R-0010 to be accomplished and allow for a transition of services to a potential new contractor. Prestige Maintenance is the only responsible offeror for exercise of this option, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements if this option was not exercised before the current contract expiration date. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to exercise of this option under FAR 52.217-8 within 15 days of this notice. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this option exercise. A determination by the Government to exercise the aforementioned option clause and not compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to exercise the option. Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to Megan Ashley at e-mail address megan.ashley@vandenberg.af.mil

<a href="mailto:ilana.bohren@us.army.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) intends to modify a bridge contract to extend the period of performance of the Counterinsurgency Advisory and Assistance Teams (CAAT) services in the Afghanistan Theater of Operations (ATO).  This extension is due to a protest filed against the award made under full and open competition, RFP W52P1J-11-R-0071.  The CAAT requirement is to provide Logistical Specialist Services; Knowledge Management; Information Management; Intelligence, Operations, and Strategic Analysis; and various Advisory services.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The current contract is scheduled to expire on 14 March 2012.  The bridge contract will have an estimated period of performance of a two (2) month extension period of performance from 15 March 2012 through 14 May 2012 with a potential of three (3) one month option periods.  The extension will provide for continuation of uninterrupted services to the CAAT services described above until the protest is resolved.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Not awarding this extension would cause serious harm to the Government.  However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the date and time identified.  Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement in the timeframe required.  Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source extension described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of Jake Adrian, the Procuring Contracting Officer.  Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be emailed to Ms. Ilana Bohren at ilana.c.bohren.civ@mail.mil or Mr. Jake Adrian at jake.m.adrian@mail.mil.

Approximately 6 months ago the pump and motor failed and was taken bacj to K & N for warranty type work.

The proposed scope of work includes:Remove and replace fan support ringsRe-insulate fan support studsClean all rotor pole connections to bare metalRemove loose barsReinstall barsSwedge bars as needed to tighten in slotsWeld all pole bar connectionsPrep rotor components for reassemblyTreat RotorBalance rotorInstall venting on lower bearing capConduct final rotor testingThis notice is not a request for proposals, and no solicitation will be issued.

<DESC>The Governor of Fukushima, Yuhei Sato, has expressed an interest in learning more about U.S. environmental clean up and remediation technologies and experiences.  In particular, he has invited U.S. contractors with expertise in environmental remediation to brief his staff.   Governor Sato has requested U.S. contractors travel to Japan to conduct this briefing in mid to late March 2012.  The briefings should provide options to clean up the Fukushima Dai-ichi site as well as the surrounding areas.  Contractor capabilities in soil and groundwater remediation; radioactive waste storage, treatment, and disposal; retrieval of spent fuel and debris from storage pools; and deactivation and decommissioning should be identified.  All contractors would be required to pay for their travel.  All standard requirements for US citizen travel to Japan will apply.  This travel would not be reimbursable to any contract with the U.S. Government.  The purpose of this announcement is to faci litate the Japanese Government in identifying potential business sources interested in traveling to Japan to attend the briefing to Japanese Governor Sato in March 2012 with the capability to perform clean up activities in soil and groundwater remediation; radioactive waste storage, treatment, and disposal; retrieval of spent fuel and debris from storage pools; and deactivation and decommissioning.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Mission Support Division, Norfolk, VA is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Argo Turboserve Corporation for providing five (5) each Retrofit Kits for General Electric (GE) Electric Government Remote (EGR) Controls GE Part Number DS6820EGRB-SP. The EGR controls are direct replacements for the obsolete General Electric Monitoring Systems (GEMS) for the ship's service diesel generators (SSDGs) on NOAA class of T-AGOS ships. Attempting to substitute some other type of control for the EGR would result in a significantly higher cost to the Government as other type of control would have to be specifically designed for this application. In addition, type approval would have to be sought from the American Bureau of Shipping. The required delivery date is April 1, 2012. The statutory authority is 41 US 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. Argo Turboserve Corporation has provided retrofit kits for the NOAA Ship Gordon Gunter. The components of the EGRs are proprietary to General Electric and Argo Turboserve Corporation is the only know source. Any warranty or performance issues with these EGR controls would put the Government at a severe disadvantage if another contractor were to provide another type of control. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). The applicable NAICS code is 332999. Interested parties may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses shall be submitted by 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, March 9, 2012. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.
The National Park Service intends to award a sole source contract using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Biological Mediation Systems, LLC for two ADA-compliant Solar Voltaic Powered Comfort Stations with patented waste reduction systems delivered to Lake Meredith National Recreation Area, Fritch, Texas.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Only one contract will be awarded. 
Authority for this award is 41 U.S.C. 253(d)(1)(A), Unique Source.
Currently there are 26 comfort stations in use at Lake Meredith National Recreation Area manufactured by BMS with the patented waste reduction vault evaporator system (patent number 5573661).  Utilization of this patented waste reduction evaporator system contained in these units, decreases daily and monthly maintenance and eliminates frequent pumping and cleaning of the vault.  This patented technology moves a stream of air throughout the lower vault without batteries or energy from a utility company.  As the air flows through the vault, moisture is removed and vented.  As a result of this patented technology, solids in the vault dry out rapidly and decrease in size which reduces the need for frequent pumping and vault clean which is a regular activity of vault toilets that do not have this patented waste reduction evaporator system.   This patented waste reduction vault evaporator system also provides for a unit that does not stink and is pleasing to the visitors.  Maintenance employees at Lake Meredith National Recreation Area have been trained and are familiar with upkeep, repairs and maintenance of the patented waste reduction vault evaporator system that is manufactured by BMS.  Holding an extra inventory of parts for a different type of comfort station not manufactured by BMS would not be cost, space or time effective.  The item is a one of a kind product which has essential unique design/performance features providing superior utility not obtainable from similar products.
Interested parties may identify their capability to respond to this requirement for possible future solicitations.  All inquiries must be addressed in writing to Rosalind Sorrell, Contracting Officer to address below.  The determination not to complete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.  This notice may represent the only official notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.  Telephone request or inquiries will not be accepted.  Responses to this notice must by received no later than 4:00 pm CST, February 24, 2012.

7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair andreasonable and the basis for that determination.The proposed cost was researched. The purchase of these licenses allows us to maintain current with theapplication, MS Servers, OCIO requirements. It also negates the need for a separate re-purchase of thesoftware in order to maintain updates. This cost savings is estimated to be substantial, with newpurchase in the range of $880 K, an expense that would occur on at least a 5- year interval. The cost ofO&M is $141K annually which includes upgrades at no extra cost. With an anticipated upgrade of atleast once per 5 years, the cost savings is approximately $175K per every 5 years; more if the intervalbetween upgrades is less.

Gordian Group Job Order Contracting methods would alsorequire separate contracts for at least each region and in many cases each park. This latter researcheslocal costs for each instance of the application and the purchase and maintenance of such cost data for400 park units would be astronomical to develop and costly and impractical to maintain.

This announcement will remain open until March 29, 2012 or until replaced by a successor BAA. Concept papers must be submitted by March 29, 2012 for funding consideration during fiscal year 2012. <br />NIOSH will not issue paper copies of this announcement and reserves the right to select for award, all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement. NIOSH provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned. It is the policy of NIOSH to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation. <br />Awards under this BAA will consist of firm fixed price contracts. Therefore, proposals submitted as a result of this announcement will fall under the purview of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). <br />I. GENERAL INFORMATION <br />A. Agency Name &not;<br />Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <br />National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health <br />Office of Mine Safety and Health Research <br />Post Office Box 18070 <br />626 Cochrans Mill Road <br />Pittsburgh, PA 15236 <br />B. Research Opportunity Title - Development and Demonstration of Mine Safety and Health Technology, Office of Mine Safety and Health Research<br />C. Program Name - Office of Mine Safety and Health Research<br />D. Research Opportunity Number - 2012-N-14257 <br />E. Response Date - This announcement will remain open until March 29, 2012. Proposals may be submitted any time during this period; however, concept papers will be reviewed during the times specified later in this announcement. <br />F. Research Opportunity Description &not;<br />The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (MINER Act) permanently established the Office of Mine Safety and Health Research under the direction of an Associate Director, within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. One purpose of this office is to enhance the development of new technology and technological applications, and to expedite the commercial availability and implementation of such technology in mining environments. The MINER Act grants the Office of Mine Safety and Health Research the authority to (1) award competitive contracts and grants to institutions and private entities to encourage the development and manufacture of mine safety equipment and (2) award contracts to education institutions or private laboratories for the performance of product testing or related work with respect to new mine technology or equipment. This announcement is an opportunity for the award of contracts for enhancing safety in mines. <br />The Office of Mine Safety and Health Research, NIOSH, is soliciting proposals to conduct research, exploratory development, testing, or evaluations of new technologies to improve mine safety, or to adapt technologies from other industries for application in mining environments that could result in improved safety for mineworkers. <br />NIOSH considers the following six topics to be areas of elevated interest, but the BAA is not restrictive to concepts that directly support the program as detailed below. <br />1. Refuge Chamber Deployment and Occupancy Status during Mine Emergency Situations: Driven by the MINER Act, refuge alternatives are required for all underground coal mines at all working sections. In a post-accident environment, knowing whether or not mine refuge chambers have been deployed and occupied is a critical piece of information when deciding to risk additional lives by sending rescue teams to these locations or to explore dangerous areas of the mine in a post-accident environment. Given the large number of rescue chambers used in underground mines, it is highly desirable to have a low-cost means of transmitting a signal from a rescue chamber that indicates whether or not the chamber has been opened and if it is in use. Further, it is desirable that the communications to the surface is highly robust so that the information can be received even in the event of a complete failure of the mine's primary communications system. One potential concept is a low-cost sensor and transceiver that is placed in the chamber that sends a beacon-type, UHF/VHF radio signal once the chamber is opened. This radio beacon signal would be received by a nearby medium frequency (MF) or Through-the-Earth (TTE) repeater that would convert the signal to MF or TTE frequencies to transmit information to the surface. While the concept is relatively simple, there are many complicating factors: the requirement that the system be approved by MSHA as permissible, the desire, for storage reasons, to eliminate anything in the refuge chamber that requires batteries, the need for all components to be protected so they will survive a disaster, the variability in shelter design, and the desire to identify a particular shelter location among many locations on a non-interfering basis.
<p>NIOSH is interested in innovative, low-cost, and practical ways to reliably send a signal to/from a rescue chamber in an underground coal mine to validate whether or not the chamber has been deployed and if it is occupied with survivors after a mine disaster.</p>
<p>2. Technology for Detection of Hazardous Conditions: The mining environment must be properly maintained to provide safe working conditions. Monitoring control interventions, such as ventilation, and sensing unanticipated hazardous conditions, such as methane gas liberation, are critical to ensuring a safe working environment. Recently, regional or mine-wide monitoring of conditions pre- and post-accident has been enhanced through the data transmission capability provided by the communication and tracking infrastructure now mandated for mine use. While these enabling technologies are likely to spur the application of enhanced mine-wide monitoring systems, leveraging this technology for assessment of remote areas of the mine are of particular interest. One such example would be the measurement of conditions in longwall bleeder systems. Bleeder systems provide critical control of methane gas liberation from longwall mining and are required to be actively monitored. However, these bleeder entries do not have access to electrical power and are adjacent to mined-out areas of the mine, exposing personnel who must access these areas to potentially reduced ground stability conditions and a lack of communication. The use of a battery-powered, intrinsically safe, wireless monitoring system would provide the mine operator with the capability to continuously monitor gas in a near real time basis. It is thought that data from this system can be used in conjunction with barometric pressure information to make adjustments in the ventilation in order to maintain working conditions that are as safe as possible. <br />NIOSH is seeking innovative solutions for improving ventilation and gas monitoring in underground mines through the use of advanced mine wide monitoring systems.<br />3. Battery Technology: Batteries are a common source of power in mining. Applications range from small battery units used to power mine communication and tracking devices to large batteries designed to power large-scale mining equipment. When the mine conditions are compromised, it may become necessary to de-energize the battery to prevent it from serving as a potential ignition source.<br />NIOSH is seeking to identify practical concepts and determine their feasibility in de-energizing or otherwise rendering batteries safe following a catastrophic mining event.<br />4. Rock Dust Technology: Underground coal mining produces finely divided coal dust that deposits throughout an underground coal mine and serves as a source of combustible material for coal dust explosions. Limestone powder, known as rock dust, is spread throughout the mine workings on a regular basis to prevent explosions. This rock dust serves to inert the coal dust when applied in the proper proportion and it must be dispersed and mixed with the coal dust during the explosion disturbance. Technologies are needed to properly meter rock dust dispersion as an integral component of the coal production cycle to achieve this goal. Active dispersion during the mining cycle must also take into account the aerodynamics of the rock and coal dust dispersion to ensure adequate coverage is achieved. Once deposited, moisture or water can cake the rock dust and significantly degrade its ability to mix with coal dust and provide adequate inertization to prevent propagation of an explosion. To prevent caking, technologies are needed to transform rock dust into a more hydrophobic material that repels moisture instead of absorbing. <br />NIOSH is seeking technologies to enable proper dispersion and metering of rock dust as an integral component of the mining cycle as well as ways to prevent rock dust caking after it has been deposited to ensure explosion prevention is maintained. <br />5. Nondestructive Testing of In-Place Seals: Seals are a critical component of explosion prevention in underground coal mines because they are designed to contain any explosion that may develop in abandoned mine areas and prevent explosion propagation into the active mine workings. Recent changes in regulations have increased the design pressure requirements from 20 psi to 50 psi and 120 psi, which increased the thickness of the seals by an order of magnitude. In addition, new materials including cellular concrete have been developed. Although seal designs must be approved by MSHA prior to use in underground coal mines and are required to be examined periodically, there is no current process to conduct nondestructive testing of installed seals to identify anomalies and determine if the seal integrity has been degraded in any way. <br />NIOSH is seeking concepts for nondestructive testing of installed seals in underground coal mines to determine if their capacity to resist designed explosion pressures has been compromised in any way.<br />6. Roof and Rib Hazard Detection: A leading cause of ground fall accidents in mines is the failure to adequately assess ground conditions. Existing methods are generally subjective and include visual inspection, striking the ground with a scaling bar to qualitatively assess conditions by the sound produced, and gathering information obtained from drilling efforts. Laboratory studies in South Africa and Australia have suggested that commercially available infrared cameras could be used in metal mines to detect loose hazardous ground by the differential in the temperature of the loose rock compared to the intact rock areas.<br />NIOSH is seeking to adapt technologies that can provide improved capacity to identify unstable ground in the skin of the mine entry that requires removal or surface control to prevent injury to mine workers.<br />The primary interest of this broad agency announcement is to promote the modification or final development of practical technologies or systems that can be adopted by the mining community in a short period of time. Under this specific solicitation, proposals to conduct theoretical or basic research will not be considered. The following examples are presented to illustrate appropriate submissions under this solicitation. <br />1. A safety technology that is currently in a prototype stage, which will require funding for final development and adaptation to the underground coal mining environment. This could include modification of prototypes to account for operation in the challenging underground coal environment, modification to meet permissibility requirements, and/or demonstration of the technology at actual mine sites. <br />2. A safety technology that is currently being used in another industry and requires modification to be adapted to underground coal mines. This could include system redesign, modification to meet permissibility requirements, in-mine testing to establish the efficacy of the technology, and/or demonstration of the technology at mine sites. <br />3. Analysis of candidate technologies to establish their potential to improve safety, and/or analyses of barriers to technology application or means of overcoming such barriers. <br />G. NOTE DATES FOR SUBMISSION OF CONCEPT PAPERS <br />Concept papers will be accepted from the release of the solicitation through March 29, 2012. Full proposals for concept papers that are found to be technically acceptable will be due within 30 days after notification by the Contracting Officer. <br />Work that will be completed in 24 months or less is desired under this solicitation, but is not a requirement; projects requiring up to 48 months will be considered. <br />Additional Information: Information and specific questions of a technical business nature only will be accepted via e-mail to the following address: minesbaa@cdc.gov.

<p>V. EVALUATION INFORMATION <br />A. Evaluation Criteria<br />Concept Papers and full proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance: <br />1. The alignment of the proposed problem solution to the mine safety goals outlined in this solicitation or demonstrated impact of proposed work to resolve a significant mine safety issue (30%)<br />2. Clear description of how/why the proposed approach represents a new or improved solution (20%).<br />3. Consideration of the risk/reward of the proposed effort and assessment of the likelihood for practical or commercial success (20%).<br />4. The qualifications of the project team and Offeror's capabilities to achieve the proposal objectives (15%).<br />5. Realism of the proposed budgetary costs to complete all elements of the proposed work (15%).<br />6. Past performance. Offeror should supply a summary of several recent (no more than 5) projects completed, including where possible, customer name, timeframes for work, and level of success achieving outcome-Plus Ten (+10) to Minus (-10) Points<br />Industry Partnering - NIOSH encourages collaboration with mining industry partners who understand the reality of the mining environment and can provide insight into mine design requirements and potential commercialization of the technology.<br />Normally an entire proposed effort is funded; however, NIOSH may be interested in funding part or parts of a proposal. For this reason the government requires Offerors to write the SOW in the form of separate tasks. It facilitates evaluation and provides an easy way to select desired tasks. If NIOSH decides to fund only part or parts of a proposal, the notification letter may request the Offeror to revise the cost proposal to reflect only what will be funded. <br />B. Evaluation Panel<br />Technical and cost proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-5 and 15.207. The cognizant program officer and other government scientific experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals. Government business professionals will evaluate cost proposals. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter-expert technical consultants. Similarly, support contractors may be utilized to evaluate cost proposals. However, proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of government personnel. Each support contractor's employee who has access to technical and cost proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any proposal submissions. <br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION <br />A. Administrative Requirements<br />1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code - The NAICS code for this announcement is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. <br />2. Central Contractor Registry (CCR) - Successful Offerors not already registered in the CCR will be required to register prior to award of any grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other transaction agreement. Information on CCR registration is available at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />3. Certifications - Full Proposals should be accompanied by an Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA) certification package in accordance with FAR clause 4.1201. The certification package should be completed online with ORCA at https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx. For contract proposals, the certification package is entitled, "Representations and Certifications for Contracts." <br />B. Reporting &not;<br />The following is a sample of deliverables that could be required under a typical research effort: <br />&bull; Technical and Financial Progress Reports; <br />&bull; Presentation Material; <br />&bull; Other Documents or Reports, and/or; <br />&bull; Final Report.</p>
<p>At a minimum a final technical report is required and is to be delivered in both hard copy and electronic format. The final report must be 508 compliant. If the final report contains proprietary information, a second version of the report must be prepared and submitted that is suitable for public release. <br />However, please note that specific deliverables (that may include software and hardware deliverables) may be proposed by each Offeror and finalized during negotiations. <br />VII. OTHER INFORMATION <br />A. Government Property/Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and Facilities</p>
<p>Each proposer must provide a very specific description of any equipment/hardware that it needs to acquire to perform the work. This description should indicate whether or not each particular piece of equipment/hardware will be included as part of a deliverable item under the resulting award. Also, this description should identify the component, nomenclature, and configuration of the equipment/hardware that it proposes to purchase for this effort. It is the government's desire to have the contractor purchase the equipment/hardware for deliverable items under their contract. The purchase on a direct reimbursement basis of special test equipment or other equipment that is not included in a deliverable item will be evaluated for allowability on a case-by-case basis. Maximum use of government integration, test, and experiment facilities is encouraged in each of the Offeror's proposals. <br />B. Government research facilities may be available and could potentially be considered government furnished equipment/facilities. These facilities and resources are of high value and some are in constant demand by multiple programs. The use of these facilities and resources will be negotiated as the program unfolds. Offerors should not assume that government owned facilities, including Lake Lynn Lab, the Safety Research Coal Mine, or the Experimental Mine, are available for research ideas submitted under this announcement. If these facilities are essential to the research proposal, the Offeror needs to clearly identify the reasons for using these facilities. If the facilities are not available during the proposed time frame for the research described in the Concept Paper and there are no other field site options listed, the Concept Paper will be rejected.</p>

Contractors must be capable of accepting payment by either electronic funds transfer or government credit card for this procurement. <br /><br />The following FAR, DFARS and DLAD clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation. The complete text of any of the clauses and provisions may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.<br /><br />FAR 52.212-1: Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items Addenda to 52.212-1; the following paragraphs are hereby deleted from this provision: (d) product samples, (e) multiple offers, and (h) multiple awards. <br /><br />NOTE: To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104.

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />(End of Provision)<br /><br />DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES: AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) (JUN 2001)<br /><br />(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.<br /><br />(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.<br /><br />(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here ( ).

POC is CPT MICHAEL MIGNANO<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERFORMANCE BASED SERVICE CONTRACT</span></strong></p>
<p>This work is being solicited as Performance Based, Commercial Item contract. Performance Based means the Contractor is responsible for an end product. If an end product is not provided, an adjustment to the payment will be made. A Commercial Item contract streamlines the terms and conditions to resemble those already used in the everyday marketplace.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BASIS OF AWARD</strong></span></p>
<p>One award will be made. Offer of award will be made to the Quoter(s) whose quote, as determined by the Contracting Officer, provides the best value to the Government, considering but not limited to such factors as price, Contractor's experience with this type of work and past performance to accomplish this type of work. The Experience Questionnaire will be used as part of the evaluation and is found as an attachment to the combined solicitation/synopsis.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall institute a complete Quality Control Plan (QCP) to ensure the requirements of this contract are provided as specified. The goal of the QCP should be to identify and correct any problems that may arise before they are identified by the CO or his/her representative. A written Quality Control Plan must be submitted to the Government prior to commencement of work and will be incorporated into the resultant contract.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SCOPE OF CONTRACT</strong></span></p>
<p>It is the purpose of this contract to secure services for wrapping Government-furnished tree seedlings. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies (except those designated as Government-furnished) and incidentals to perform all work necessary to wrap trees at the location specified.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WRAPPING LOCATION </strong></span></p>
<p>The tree wrapping facility is located at the Hungry Horse Ranger District at the Administration Site, Hungry Horse, Montana.</p>
<p>Facilities to be used in the prosecution of the work are the Forest Service tree wrapping storage and compound area. The tree seedlings shall be wrapped at the tree wrapping compound and stored in the tree cooler or as otherwise directed by the Contracting Officers Representative, (COR).</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SITE VISIT (FAR 52.237-1) (APRIL 1984)</strong></span></p>
<p>Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable.

<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED PROPERTY</strong></span></p>

<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CONTRACT TIME</strong></span></p>
<p>The need for tree wrapping services may not be continuous. There may be periods of high activity around the dates that various planting units open. Likewise, there may be periods of inactivity when planting units have not opened, the number of wrapped trees exceeds the 3-day planting needs, or weather and ground conditions have closed the tree planting sites, etc. These periods of inactivity, which may be of several days duration, are considered normal to this type of work. The Contractor is expected to suspend operations during these periods of inactivity and to begin again promptly when additional trees are needed to be wrapped.</p>

<p>When weather and ground conditions are favorable for planting and tree survival, the Notice to proceed with the work will be issued. The effective date of the Notice to Proceed will be a few days before the tree planting begins. Because proper planting conditions prevail for a limited length of time, it is imperative that the Contractor begin work promptly once conditions are favorable and be able to respond to a varied number of requested trees to be wrapped.</p>
<p>For this Contract, all wrapping will be done at Hungry Horse Ranger Station. The Contractor shall generally be required to wrap trees from designated nursery lots at a rate of 7,000 to 30,000 trees per day.

The Government may also take the following actions:</p>
<p>a. Presentation of a Contract Discrepancy Report requiring a written explanation for substandard performance.<br />b. Payment deductions in accordance with the PRS.<br />c. Payment deductions in accordance with the applicable FAR clause(s).<br />d. Require correction or re-performance of the service.</p>

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
MEDICAL WASTE PICK UP, TRANSPORT AND DISPOSAL SERVICES
For Information Purposes Only
 This Performance Assessment Plan is furnished as information only, and will not be made part of any resulting contract.
1.	INTRODUCTION.  The purpose of Quality Assurance (QA) is to measure and determine contract compliance of the quality and quantity of goods and services purchased from a contractor.   A written Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) enables the Government to document Government evaluation of the contractor's work and draw conclusions about the contractor's overall performance.  This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been designed to aid the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) in providing effective and systematic surveillance of contract services for the pickup through the disposition of Medical Waste Pick Up, Transport, and Disposal at VAMC Lexington, Kentucky and five (5) additional locations per the Statement of Work.

1.1	Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) summarizes the contract requirements, their standards, Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL), the QA methods the activity plans to use to perform the evaluation of each contract requirement, and the deduct percentage.  

1.2	Contractor Responsibility.  This QASP is based on the premise that the contractor, not the Government, is responsible for the management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  The AQLs recognize that unforeseen and uncontrollable problems may occur.  Good management and use of an adequate quality control plan will allow the Contractor to operate within the allowable AQLs.  
2	DEVELOPMENT OF THE SURVEILLANCE SCHEDULE 
2.1	Surveillance Schedule.  It is the COR's responsibility to develop a schedule for inspection activities.  
3.	SURVEILLANCE.  Each inspection made by the COR will occur after the pickup of waste and will be documented and filed for further reference, audit, and proof of inspection.
3.1	100% Inspection.  100% Inspection is a QA method designed to evaluate all outputs of the contract requirement and will be used to determine payment authorization of invoices.
4.	SURVEILLANCE RESULTS SUMMARY
4.1	Performance Requirements Summary.  This summary will be used to record information on weights and counts of regulated medical waste containers.  These documents will then become a formal VAMC record for later reference.
5.	REVISIONS TO THE QASP:  This QASP was developed considering known factors at the time of its development.  It is understood that requirements for QA may change, e.g. modifications to the contract may add or delete service requirements; COR resources may change; changes may be made as a result of lessons learned, technological innovation and modifications made by the Contractor to his Quality Control Program.  Revisions to this surveillance plan are the joint responsibility of the EMS COR, Contractor, and the Contracting Officer.     

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY

1.	Contract Number:
2.	Activity:  Environmental Management Service (137-LD)
3.	Performance Period:  FY 12 and four (4) option years as if determined in the best interest of the Government. 
4.	Summary of Contractor's Performance:

PRS Item/Service	AQL	Pass	Fail	Comments
Pick-up of Regulated Medical Waste within prescribed time frames	100%			
Contractor 24/7 availability for emergency consults	100%			
Timely reporting of incidents	100%

<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. This solicitation requires offerors of such products to submit all drawings, specifications, or other data necessary to enable the government to determine whether the alternate product is either identical to or physically, mechanically, electronically, and functionally interchangeable with the product specified. This statement warns offerors that the failure to furnish all necessary information may preclude consideration of the offer, stating that the alternate product will be considered technically unacceptable, if acceptability cannot be determined before award. Newly-manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to a manufacturer, manufacturer's COC, FAA 8130, and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location. All parts shall be NEW approved parts. Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. Required delivery is 365 days after contract award. Deliver to USCG Aviation Logistics Center, Receiving Section, Bldg 63, Elizabeth City, NC. FOB Point - Destination.

Midgette, (252) 335-6943, Sheila.G.Midgette@uscg.mil.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U S Coast Guard, 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, D.

When any of the above holidays fall on a Sunday, the following Monday will be observed as the holiday; when a holiday falls on a Friday or Saturday the preceding Thursday is observed as the holiday.<BR><BR>Access to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) requires that Contractor employees voluntarily submit personal data (e.g., name, social security number, etc.) when applying for a DPG Identification Card or temporary access pass.  This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks.Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.Delays caused by any adverse employee information do not constitute a basis for claim by the Contractor.  It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds.<BR><BR>(a)	The Government and the contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the contractor to the Government are non-personal services and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee or master-servant relationships exist or will exist under the contract between the Government and the contractor and/or between the Government and the contractor?s employees.  It is therefore in the best interest of the Government to afford the parties a full and complete understanding of their respective obligations.(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:
(1)	be placed in a position where they are appointed or employed by a Federal Officer, or are under the supervision, direction, or evaluation of a Federal Officer, Military or Civilian.
(2)	be placed in a staff or policy making position.
(3)	be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration of control over DA Military or Civilian Personnel, or personnel of other contractors, or become a part of the Government organization.
(4)	be used for the purpose of avoiding manpower ceilings or other personnel rules and regulations of DA or the Civil Service Commission.
(5)	be used in administration or supervision of military procurement activities.(c)	Employee Relationship:
(1)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the contractor or his employees to exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the Government, but rather the contractor?s employees will act and exercise personal judgment and discretion on behalf of the contractor.
(2)	Rules, regulations, directions, and requirements which are issued by command authorities under their responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the installation, or who travel on Government transportation.  This stipulation is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control which is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.<BR><BR>U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground is located in a remote area.  The main gate is approximately 90 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah.  Contractors may be required to travel up to 150 miles one way from Salt Lake City to reach some work sites.<BR><BR>Contractors with valid U.S. government contracts will be allowed to hire non U.S. citizens to work at or visit U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) during performance of the contract.

A list of foreign national employees shall be provided to the DPG Counterintelligence, Law Enforcement, and Security Offices at least five (5) working days prior to arrival on post.  A copy of  the list shall also be submitted to the Contracting Officer or an appointed Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR).  The list will contain name, nationality, green card and social security number, date of birth, drivers license number and state where issued.The Contractor shall also list the date(s) foreign nationals will be on post.  If a sensitive test or visit is scheduled during the dates provided, the Counterintelligence Office will inform the Contractor whether the work/visit may take place.   Employees will not be allowed on Post until verification process is complete.  Once verification has been received, the Counterintelligence Office is responsible to provide the Protocol Office the following information for badge preparation:  Name, Company and Point-of-Contact.  The Contracting Officer or COR will be responsible to pick-up the badges and holders, issue them to the visitor and return them at the end of the visit.<BR><BR>Questions concerning this buy must be submitted at least 3 days prior to the established closing date to reasonably expect aresponse from the Government. Those questions not received within theproscribed date may not be considered.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended in an effort to answer questions proposed by interested offerors, and to specify the distance from the main facility.&nbsp; The time for submitting quotes SHALL NOT BE EXTENDED by issuing this amendment.<br />
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<p>1.	Where were your 9-10 spaces before/currently?<br />In the garage located at 409 3rd St. SW, Washington, DC 20024</p>
<p>2.	 How does the contractor submit the proposal?<br />The contractor shall demonstrate in its quote that it meets all of the minimum requirements listed in the RFQ (note: please see the clarification below on the distance from the facility), in addition to its price quote.  Additionally, provide at least 1 past performance reference.</p>
<p>3.	Garage shall operate with the hours of 5:00 am - 8:00 pm.  Does this require the proposed facility to be physically open and staffed during these times as opposed to the parkers simply having access during these timeframes.<br />Parkers shall have access during these timeframes.</p>
<p>4.	Do the end users need the ability to self-park or is valet and the need to potentially leave their key an option for this opportunity.<br />Self-parking only.</p>
<p>5.	Will these individuals be primarily parked for the day once they arrive or will they be entering/exiting multiple times a day.<br />Parkers shall be able to come and go as they please within the required timeframes.</p>
<p><strong>Clarification:</strong></p>
<p>The government feels as though 2 blocks is too broad an interpretation for the distance from the building requiring parking, and therefore is clarifying that any facility be within 0.2 miles of 409 3rd St. SW, Washington, DC 20024.  The government will use an online mapping tool to determine the distance from the facility to the address of the parking facility.</p>

<DESC>Below are the Q&amp;A for this action:<br /><br />What is the meaning of BPA? Would you explain it more?
<p>The Federal Acquisition defines a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) as follows:</p>
<p>A blanket purchase agreement (BPA) is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing "charge accounts" with qualified sources of supply.</p>
<p>It is a type of order the government uses when they have a requirement for a product or service, in this case light refreshment, and we do not know the exact quantity we need or when we need it. There is no minimum guaranteed funding on these BPAs.</p>
<p><br />- It is my understanding that there are approximately 1,500 meetings total in a calendar year with 20 participants at each meeting. However, in the document that you sent 50% of these meetings will be catered by a small business. Since our company does not fall into this category, does that mean that the maximum about of meetings that we could potentially cater would be 750 annually? <br />- Your document also states that you will be selecting a minimum of 3 vendors and a maximum of 10. Does that further mean that the maximum amount of meetings that our company could cater would be 250 annually?</p>
<p><br />NSF plans to set up blanket purchase agreements with multiple vendors. This is not a competed action where the winning bidder receives all of the business for this particular service. As stated there also is no guaranteed minimum made to winning bidders. Once these Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) are set up, members of our program staff would place orders under one of these BPAs for a particular meeting using their government credit card.</p>
<p>NSF intends to establish BPAs with multiple vendors and we have a goal of 50% of those vendors being small businesses. Once these multiple BPAs are established there will no percentage requirements on the actual purchasing.</p>

The ESIF-MSS-1 Resource will provide long-term data retention and backup for the ESIF HPC environment, and includes the following resources:</p>
<p>&bull; Near Line Storage (Tier1) Resource<br />&bull; Second Tier Storage (Tier2) Resource<br />&bull; Validation, Test, and Debugging Client (VTD) Resource,<br /><br />The ESIF-MSS-1 Resource is expected to be a tiered storage solution, with the Near Line Tier consisting of disk and the Second Tier consisting of tape, and will be capable of dynamically moving data to the most appropriate media type, migrating data to new media types as they become available, storing data in open formats, and being accessible by industry standard protocols. The HPC clients are expected to manually move their data to the Near Line storage with standard Linux commands or vendor supplied commands. The data migration is dynamically moved to the Second Tier Storage without client interaction or knowledge. The solution must be able to scale in both performance and capacity to support multiple petabytes (PB) of storage and be extremely cost-effective on the basis of cost-per-gigabyte, density, and operation for cooling and power. The solution must be fully protected without external backups and capable of providing reasonable performance for both ingest and later access.</p>

<DESC>All offerors, be advised that the Government has posted Questions & Answers for offerer review.
W15QKN-12-R-F003 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
23 FEBRUARY, 2012
1. Ref. Section B, Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs, Contract Minimum/Maximum
Question: We are recommending that the maximum required production rate be reduced to 75 per month, as being a significantly more cost effective rate while still meeting the maximum potential award of 1,970 units. Not to change the solicitation requirement of 150/mo. will result in idle costly capacity, a competitive disadvantage to small business offerors, and the potential for cycles of volatility in production workforce requirements resulting in the potential losses of skilled people.
Answer: The Government has reviewed the request to reduce the maximum required production rate per month on Solicitation W15QKN-12-R-F003. In response, the Government requires that production remain as stated in Solicitation W15QKN-12-R-F003.
2. Ref. Page 79 of Solicitation w15QKN-12-R-F003
Question: Page 79 of the subject solicitation contains the following requirement: (5) Past Performance Questionnaire. Where can this document be located?
Answer: Item (5) titled Past Performance Questionnaire on page 79 of Solicitation has been removed from solicitation W15QKN-12-R-F003. Potential Offerors do not need to complete the questionnaire. All other requirements in this section remain the same. Amendment 0001 to solicitation captures this change.
3. Ref. Section B-Contract Minimum/Maximum
Question: What was the previous price? What is the minimum quantity that Government will buy? What is the chance that the contract may be awarded to Small Business?
Answer: In accordance with Article A-4,52.224-4001 Disclosure of Unit Price Information, the Government has not released unit prices on past purchases of the MK19 GMG. Page 6 of solicitation W15QKN-12-R-F003 states that the minimum obligation quantity will be 73 units. Page 3 of solicitation W15QKN-12-R-F003, states that this procurement is unrestricted.
4.Question: What is the possibility of revising bid range quantities to add additional increments?
Answer: The Government has reviewed this request and will keep the existing quantity ranges as stated in solicitation W15QKN-12-R-F003.

S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form. JCP will return an approved and signed certified form within 5 days of receipt. Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect. Additionally, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems. o The CS/Vendors can check the following website to ensure their JCP status: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/search.aspx &bull; Once you receive the MPIN, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. o The MPIN number is a mandatory data element created by the CCR registrant and must have nine characters: at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number. No spaces or special characters are permitted. It allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also serves as a validation to access sensitive but unclassified documents associated with a notice posted to FedBizOpps. </span></p>

Once vendors request explicit access, the FBO system will send notification to the DESC personnel assigned to the procurement, who will approve the request in the system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DESC. o If a request for explicit access was previously submitted, and is pending review, the vendor will see a designation that explicit access was previously submitted. o If a request for explicit access was previously submitted, and granted, the vendor will see designation that explicit access was previously granted. o If you have not received notification from the FBO system that you have received explicit access, please contact the POCs assigned to the procurement you are interested in. &bull; Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents. Some important notes to keep in mind: Vendors MUST allow sufficient time for the submission and processing of the DD2345 request. Requests for extension of closing/due dates based upon lack of access to secured documents will not generally be considered without evidence of timely DD2345 submission. DLIS does not correlate a particular DD2345 to a specific procurement or to DESC. Your DLIS certification will be valid until the expiration date listed in block 7c of the DD2345, and can be used for any procurement in the FBO system. For any additional questions, there is a user guide for vendors located under the "Getting Started" tab of the FBO website. Information regarding access to secured documents can be found starting on page 44 of the Vendor user guide.</span></p>

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>This is a market survey for the procurement of 150 Encoders as required for support of the Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) 11 System.  The attached draft Statement of Work describes the acquisition of these ASR-11 Encoders, NSN 5865-01-512-6746, P/N 3708E8ZS-1.
The design of the ASR-11 Encoders is proprietary to Raytheon Canada Limited, and currently, the only known source for these Encoders is BEI Precision Systems, Inc. 
Interested vendors must have access to the original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) current specifications and drawings.  Potential sources must provide documentation to the FAA showing proof for rights to use the data from the OEM.  
Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.  Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further action by the FAA.
The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting proposals at this time.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the ASR-11 Encoders, per the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:        Type of services provided by your firm,         Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance),         Number of years in business
Please respond by reviewing the draft Statement of Work and submitting a filled-out and signed copy of the Declaration form (please submit electronically, email to address below).
All responses to this market survey must be received by Thursday, March 8, 2012, 3:00 CST (Oklahoma Time).   All submittals should be submitted by email to:

<DESC>This is modification 1 to the synopsis entitled "SAFETY AND MISSION ASSURANCEENGINEERING CONTRACT" which was posted on February 7, 2012 under the Reference NumberNNJ12424577L. You are notified that the following changes are made: NASA/JSC is requesting information from industry regarding potential organizationalconflicts of interest (OCI) arising from the Safety and Mission Assurance EngineeringContract (SMAEC).The nature of the work anticipated under the SMAEC may create a situation where therecould be the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each potentialofferor should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASAs anticipation of OCI issues andconsider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision tocompete for the SMAEC. Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the SMAEC will include the followingtypes of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive. Assessment of component and system designs, analysis, models developed for theOrion/Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV);  Assessment of component and system designs, analysis, models developed for theInternational Space Station (ISS) or Extravehicular Activities (EVA);  Assessment of component and system designs, analysis, models developed for thecommercial crew or cargo providers;  Assessment of hardware designs, analysis, and models developed for the JSC byContractors, and Space Act Agreement Participants;  Assessment of new technology disclosures (aka invention disclosures) including, forexample, new and novel hardware, software, and processes;  Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional informationassociated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitiveprocurements;  Access to a Contractor, or Space Act Agreement Participants proprietary informationwhere said Contractor, and Space Act Agreement Participant is not the SMAEC Contractor; Quality assurance oversight for fabrication of hardware by Contractors, other than theSMAEC contractor,  for flight hardware and software and quality and safety oversight fortest and evaluation of flight hardware.These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending onthe composition of the team selected for the SMAEC contract:  Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the SMAECContractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a governmentprocurement contract;  Potential impaired objectivity if the SMAEC contractor or its subcontractors areassessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, jointventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractors;  Potential impaired objectivity if the SMAEC contractor or its subcontractors or relatedcompanies are responsible for assessing or performing safety and mission assurance forhardware or data generated by the SMAEC contractor, its subcontractors, or relatedcompanies under another JSC contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or Space ActAgreement;  Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments and adviceto NASA personnel on specific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASAspreparation of a specification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASAsevaluation of proposals in a future competitive procurement. Potential offerors are requested to address the following questions: 1.  What type of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, shouldyou choose to propose on the SMAEC contract? 2.  What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that youidentified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience withother contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc.3.  Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed SMAEC that werenot identified in this RFI?4.  Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SMAEC that would causeyou to decide not to propose on the potential SMAEC RFP?A link to the NASA Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest has been posted to theSMAEC procurement website at:  http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/smaec/  .  Pleasereference this document for additional information about NASAs policies with respect toOCI issues.  You are requested to provide electronic responses via e-mail to the Contracting Officerlisted at the end of this synopsis.  Your response is requested by 4:00 p.m. local timeon March 9, 2012.  NASA intends to assess any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offerorsproposed OCI mitigation strategy, responding to each company who submits a mitigationstrategy in writing.  NASAs response will simply be an attempt to preliminarily examinepossible circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI.  It will not be aconfirmation that, in fact, an OCI will ultimately exist or that an offeror cansuccessfully eliminate or mitigate an OCI.  Furthermore, the response in no way alters orinterprets the application of FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or afinal proposal submission, should a potential offeror elect to submit a proposal inresponse to an RFP issued under a solicitation for SMAEC.  Subsequent to the initialsubmission and response, the Government will not consider further information as itrelates to this RFI.The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes,to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only.	NASA willnot affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public,but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy,and therefore such information may be recognizable to the potential offeror who submittedit.  Any information submitted in response to this RFI that is marked as ConfidentialCommercial or Financial Information will be considered as voluntarily submitted inaccordance with the Freedom of Information Act.The Government intends to release the names, addresses, and points of contact of allrespondents unless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent.  All questionsshould be directed to the point of contact identified below.  In accordance with FAR15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by theGovernment to form a binding contract.	The Government is under no obligation to issue asolicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI.  The Government will notpay for any information solicited under this RFI.  No solicitation exists; therefore, donot request a copy of a solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will besynopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.	It is thepotential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of anysolicitation or synopsis.

<DESC><p><br />AMENDMENT TO THE SYNOPSIS IS BEING ISSUED TO CLARIFY THAT THE SYNOPSIS&nbsp;CLOSE DATE&nbsp;WAS FEBRUARY 23, 2012 NOT 15-DAYS FROM THE PUBLICATION.<br /><br />AS A RESULT OF THE INCONSISTENCY, THE DATE IS BEING REESTABLSIHED TO READ FEBRUARY 24, 2012 12-NOON EST.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;The National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is conducting market research for the purposes of identifying sources who have demonstrated capabilities in the area of aeronautical and space systems engineering. No solicitation of offers is made by this synopsis.</p>
<p>NOAA/NESDIS is dedicated to providing timely access to global environmental data from satellites and other sources to promote, protect, and enhance the Nation's economy, security, environment, and quality of life. To fulfill its responsibilities, NESDIS acquires and manages the Nation's operational environmental satellites, provides data, and information services, and conducts related research.</p>
<p>NESDIS manages NOAA's operational polar-orbiting environmental satellite program. NOAA/NESDIS' objective is to provide the spacecraft, launch services, and ground systems necessary to maintain the uninterrupted flow of remotely-sensed environmental data required to promote, protect, and enhance the Nation's economy, security, environment, and quality of life. Further information regarding the requirements of this program can be found at the following web site: http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov.</p>
<p>NESDIS also organizationally houses the Technology, Planning and Integration for Observations (TPIO) program. TPIO functions as the analytical resource arm of the NOAA Observing Systems Council (NOSC), chaired by Dr. Kathryn Sullivan, NOAA's Assistant Secretary for Environmental Observation and Prediction, with vice chairs from three other NOAA Line Offices, National Weather Service, NESDIS, and Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. The program provides the assessments and analyses of NOAA's Observing System Portfolio resulting in data-driven, strategic investment recommendations for the NOSC. This support reaches the highest levels of NOAA's leadership and requires access to and assessment of very sensitive, government proprietary information on over 200 observing system technical capabilities, specific system costs, product impacts from each of these systems and very sensitive leadership-determined priorities/rankings of the over 65 Programs across NOAA. This assessment work leads to briefings and recommendations to NOAA senior leadership on observation system capabilities, budget issues, system utility and the best combination of observing systems in NOAA's portfolio. Our work in this area is considered "cutting edge" across Federal Government and our model is now being implemented by USGS and the National Earth Observations (NEO) task force under the President's Office of Science, Technology and Policy. TPIO has been designated to directly apply our analysis methodology and tools developed by MITRE to this high priority, federal level, Task Force. This assessment of critical observing systems, identified across over 17 federal agencies, is due Jul 01, 2012. This analysis is a direct deliverable to OSTP and OMB for impact to the FY13 and FY 14 President's Budget. Further information regarding the requirements of this program can be found at the following web site: http://www.tpio.nosc.noaa.gov/tpio/.</p>
<p>NESDIS needs an organization to provide independent and objective support over the next five years in architecture planning development for all of NOAA's observing systems, acquisition support, systems development, operations support, and assessments of technology opportunities and alternatives for future and current polar satellite programs as well as domestic and foreign commercial satellite technology and policy implementation. The primary tasks under the resultant contract would be for support of NOAA's largest Satellite Program (approximately 20% of NOAA's overall budget) and analytical assessments of all of NOAA's observing systems, their requirements and capabilities and how they affect NOAA's budget and effectiveness for the execution of NOAA's Mission, as well as the same kind of effort on a National level. Because of the sensitive nature of these services, we need an organization who will not experience significant organizational conflicts of interest from any analysis and recommendations in support of the agency mission.</p>
<p>Currently, NOAA/NESDIS is acquiring these services as the result of a sole source acquisition with the MITRE Corporation pursuant to 41 USC 253 (c)(1) and has done so for about seventeen years. MITRE possesses significant NOAA domain expertise and experience. This knowledge spans satellite programs, observing systems, observing requirements, societal benefits, environmental/weather knowledge, and significant analytic and economic skill sets which allow TPIO to produce recommendations, studies, assessments that are unbiased and free of organizational conflicts of interest. These activities look heavily into NOAA's budget and spending over future years and a Federally Funded Research and Development Center is the only entity capable of handling the job. FFRDCs are unique independent nonprofit entities sponsored and funded by the U.S. government to meet specific long-term technical needs that cannot be met by any other single organization. FFRDCs typically assist government agencies with scientific research and analysis, systems development, and systems acquisition. They bring together the expertise and outlook of government, industry, and academia to solve complex technical problems. TPIO is currently working on one such complex critical analysis and assessment that will influence the upcoming budget estimates for FY-13 and FY-14, any interruption in support would significantly impact the TIPO Program and NOAA. MITRE also led the development of the JPSS instruments to spacecraft interface requirements document. This document has been managed by MITRE for over a decade now, and MITRE employees have lead the negotiation of the interface agreements with each of the Ball, ITT, Raytheon, NGES, and NGAS instruments. Their knowledge of the history and rationale for the agreements would be extremely difficult and costly to replace, and would increase the difficulty risk of dealing with technical issues during JPSS-1 Spacecraft integration, test and operations. Recreating this knowledge within JPSS would jeopardize the improvement and updates to the ADL, significantly increasing JPSS costs for integrating science code into the operational baseline of the processing system and potentially causing an adverse impact to the Calibration and Validation activities. FFRDC work in the public interest and operate as strategic partners with their sponsoring government agencies to ensure the highest levels of objectivity and technical excellence. If based on the results of this description and the evaluation of any capability statement(s) submitted in response to this synopsis, it is determined that there are no other qualified sources, this synopsis will serve as the notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with the MITRE Corporation and will meet the publication requirements of a proposed sole source award.</p>
<p>The two primary tasks under any resultant contract would be for support of the Joint Polar Satellite System Program Office and the Technology, Planning and Integration for Observations Program. The Government estimates the following level of effort per year: 6816 senior professional hours and 384 technical and administrative for approximately 3 staff members per year to be provided on site and 0.75 reach-back support (based on an estimated 1,920 productive person year).&nbsp; Note the justification is for the proposed one-month interim.&nbsp; The information above, describes the full requirements over a fivce year period.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to provide qualified management, personnel, organizational structure, procedural and administration functions to effectively and efficiently manage the work performed under any contract. Interested offerors having the specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 15 pages or less within the publication closing dater of this announcement. In addition to addressing organizational conflicts of interest, the capability statement should address the organization's ability to support all aspects of the aforementioned technical capabilities, and specifically address the following:</p>
<p>Describe relevant organizational experiences in performance and management of Research and Development in the area of aeronautical, space systems engineering, defining and developing current and next generation operational environmental satellite systems. Experience with TPIO work, familiarity with all of NOAA observing systems and capabilities, the NOSIA and HIPOS tasks, and the tools used for those assessments and analyses. The contractor must possess knowledge of observation system capabilities, utilities, the CasaNOSA database, the NOAA requirements collection and validation process. The support provided must also have polar satellite experience, knowledge of DoD systems and procedures, working knowledge of JPSS instruments to spacecraft interface requirements, working knowledge of ADL and it's design and implementation, working knowledge of JPSS change control processes, conomic factors of our systems and how they relate to societal benefits. Recent work with cost benefit analysis, meteorology, oceanography, operations research, systems engineering are also needed. Reference and provide detailed examples of work in the technical areas listed above.</p>
<p>Detail relevant organizational experiences for contracts with multiple tasks and/or projects and include average number of tasks/year managed.</p>
<p>Identify the credentials of key staff members, their contributions on other similar projects, and their availability to any resultant contract.</p>
<p>Detail relevant organizational experience with confidential and sensitive information and the avoidance of conflicts of interests (as noted above).</p>
<p>In addition to addressing technical capabilities, responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business (i.e., large, small, small disadvantaged business, woman owned, etc.); average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partner's, prime contractor (if potential subcontractor) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; point of contact - address and phone number), and list any existing Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACS) for which you are currently qualified.</p>
<p>Telephone responses are NOT solicited. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract nor will the Government pay for information solicited.</p>
<p>Responses must be received in writing no later than by the date specified in the notice.</p>

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice Only and is for informational market research purposes only to determine the availability of potential qualified contractors.<br />Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. The NAICS code is 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.<br />NAICS code is 236220 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.<br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests interest from contractors interested in performing work on a potential design-bid-build construction solicitation for the estimated price range of more than $10,000,000. <br /><br /><br />"The sources sought notice (W912DR-12-S-0011) submitted on 23 Jan 2012 is hereby amended to change the estimated price range of more than "$10,000,000" to Between "$25,000,000 and $100,000,000". The deadline for accepting responses is hereby extended to 6 Mar 2012 @12 (noon). The point of contact is Karen L. Johnson (karen.l.johnson@usace.army.mil) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br /><br />National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Campus East (NCE) - Third Floor Build Out at the Tech Center<br />1.0 OBJECTIVE: The Issued-For-Construction (IFC) package for the NGA Third Floor Build Out of the Technology Center contains completed drawings and specifications for fitting out 29,500 SF room that currently has a bare concrete floor depressed 3' from grade, CMU walls and concrete ceiling with pendant industrial lights. The work will transform this space into a state of the art Data Center with Tier 2 plus reliability and concurrent maintainability with a power density of 150 watts/SF designed around a hot aisle/cold aisle cooling concept. This project will upgrade critical IT infrastructure for NGA, doubling the size of the data center in Springfield, VA. <br />2.0 SCOPE OF WORK: Provide and install a fully functional Data Center with Tier 2 plus reliability on the third floor of the NCE Technology Center. A Tier 2 Data Center guarantees 99.741% availability provided by redundant capacity components and single non-redundant distribution paths serving the site's equipment. The Data Center will have UPS and engine generators with a capacity design of Need plus One (N+1), with a single power path.<br />While this is not a complete listing of the scope requirements, following are some specific features of the Data Center further described within the IFC package:<br />2.1 Installation of a raised access floor with stringers grounded to form an equipotential reference plane for the IT racks (provided as GFE equipment) that the contractor will secure to and ground to this floor.<br /><br />2.2 Architectural work includes acoustic ceiling, furred gypsum drywall on existing CMU walls, demountable partitions with integral doors, painting, signage and a thorough cleaning after construction is complete to meet data center standards as specified by the International Organization for Standardization Class 8 in accordance with ISO 1466-1.<br /><br />2.3 Mechanical work consists of installation of 50+ Computer Room Air Conditioning (CRAC) units, chilled water distribution piping, pre-action sprinkler system, chilled water pumps, ductwork, fans and a hydrogen detection system (for UPS battery rooms) as well as a new cooling tower and chiller in the Central Utility Plant.<br /><br />2.4 Electrical work includes Power Distribution Units and Remote Power Panel installation in the new data center and all under floor receptacles to power the computer equipment. Due to the criticality of this facility each piece of computer equipment is fed from 2 different sources to provide redundancy in case of failure of one source. The electrical system must be installed with redundancy so that failure on any one component will not cause a failure of the IT equipment. Additionally, the electrical system involves installation of 2 large Uninterruptable Power System arrays of batteries, new rotary uninterruptable systems, new switchgear, new multi-ended unit substations and bus ducts, lighting and options for up to 3 backup diesel generators located outside the Central Utility Plant. There are options for Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems to be installed on up to 12 generators with a urea tank system to mitigate the waste from the SCR's. <br /><br />2.5 Controls systems work includes expansion of the existing photoelectric fire alarm system. There is an option to replace this with an aspirating laser scanner fire alarm system. Additionally, an expansion and tie in to the existing building automation system and power monitoring system are in the scope of this project. It is critical that this be done seamlessly to avoid losing any control and monitoring capability to the existing 24x7, 365 day/year data center. <br /><br />2.6 Telecom work includes installation of a multi level cable tray system and installation of telecom cabling from the existing operational computer room to the new data center. Access to the existing data center will be severely limited due to operations and all work must be done under security escort. <br /><br />2.7 Contractor will need to work in this space under a joint use arrangement with other follow on contractors specifically for IT and security installations.<br /><br />3.0 SCHEDULE: Upon award, the Contractor shall develop a proposed schedule for the completion of all work as described in Section 2.0 above and as further described in the IFC documents. The schedule shall be developed in accordance with all contract requirements and submitted for review and approval no later than thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the Notice to Proceed (NTP).<br />3.1 NGA desired BoD is April 2013. The performance duration will not exceed 14 months (426 calendar days) beyond NTP.<br /><br />4.0 SECURITY: <br />4.1 The existing data center is a secure facility located on the 4th floor of the Technology Center and must remain operational 24x7 hours/day, 365 days/year throughout the construction of this project. Routine outages impacting other areas of the Technology Center or elsewhere on the NGA Campus will NOT BE PERMITTED. Any outages that must occur will have to be coordinated through an agency outage control board. This process takes 1 month and is subject to last minute changes due to mission impacts.<br />4.2 This project occurs in an operational Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) so all activities in the project scope will be performed under the supervision of government provided escorts. Work hours, access to the NGA site, access to the work area will all be restricted and must be coordinated. These restrictions may include: US workers only, no cellular phones, no cameras, no recording devices, subject to search at any time, inspection of all materials/tools/equipment, pre-coordinated access and approval of any personnel. Utilization of the 'E-Verify' System will likely be required for all personnel &amp; workers accessing the site.<br />5.0 OTHER: The contractor shall conform with the installation policy regarding vehicle and personnel access and any special tenant security requirements. The contractor shall comply with all requirements for preparation of the Health and Safety plan, in particular, any confined space entry as required as part of this SOW will be conducted per the Health and Safety Plan and applicable Federal, State and Local requirements. <br />The Contractor shall submit documentation to the following office:<br />US Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District<br />Belvoir Integrated Program Office<br />6050 1st Street, Building 1444<br />ATTENTION : DREW WHITE<br />Fort Belvoir, VA 22060<br />All data, reports, submissions, and other materials under this delivery order are property of the US Government and shall not be released by the Contractor or his/her affiliates without written approval by the Contracting Officer. Upon completion of the contract, the Contractor shall provide copies of all documentation and unused project information to the Government for use or disposal as appropriate.<br />6.0 OPTIONS:<br />6.1 Aspirating Laser Scanner Fire Alarm System.<br />6.2 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Systems<br />7.0 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 14 months (426 calendar days) from award date.<br /><br /><br />NOTE: Please note that it is required that your company be registered in the Contractors Central Registration (CCR) System, please see www.ccr.gov for additional information. In addition, this sources sought is not to be construed as a commitment by the government, nor will the government pay for any information solicited or delivered. Responses are to be sent via email to karen.l.johnson@usace.army.mil no later than 12:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time), 6 February 2012.<br /><br />

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA) SEEKING 
EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST TO ACQUIRE VACANT LAND FOR 
CONSTRUCTION OF NATIONAL CEMETERY COLUMBARIUM

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is interested in acquiring vacant land on which it may construct a VA columbarium in Chicago, Illinois.  VA will also consider a donation of land or value.

A columbarium consists of a wall-like structure that contains individual niches designed to hold cremated remains.  The structure can be constructed outdoors, or an existing building may be fitted with prefabricated banks of niches to create an indoor memorial space.

<DESC>This project will construct an Entry Control Facility (ECF) at Gate 2 located at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY) to provide the appropriate Anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) measures meeting all applicable model building codes and Uniform Facility Criteria (UFC) requirements.  The ECF will have three inbound drive lanes for the screening of vehicles accessing the base and two outbound drive lanes for vehicles leaving the base.  One of the inbound lanes will be a commercial vehicle inspection lane which is segregated from the other lanes by a windscreen.  Sustainable principles have been integrated into the design and development of this project and will be implemented during construction of the project in accordance with Executive Order 13123 and other laws and Executive Orders.

The construction will also include four buildings: a gatehouse with overhead canopy, an overwatch tower, sentry/guard booths and a replacement for the quarters Y garage.
  A covered walkway will be constructed along the exterior of the commercial vehicle inspection lane to provide a sheltered passage way for pedestrians accessing the shipyard.  Construction will also consist of the following: swing gates; security fencing; snowmelt system; intrusion detection system (IDS), closed circuit television (CCTV), local area network (LAN), and base wide alarm duress system; security lighting and signage; elevated control lane island with bull nose protection; site lighting; rejection area for vehicles located before and after guard house; a vehicle inspection area with shelters equipped with CCTV; active vehicle barriers designed to facilitate snow, sand, and salt removal; raised traffic median; hardened back-up generator; a  pedestrian turnstile and a manually operated service gate to accommodate wheelchairs with ID card reader.
  The project will also construct an underground utility vault to house the water main meter and back flow preventer along with associated piping and fittings.

As part of this project, the following buildings will be demolished: building #161 (approximately 3,039 square feet), a guard house with canopy, an existing overwatch tower and the existing quarters Y garage.

The contractor shall provide all required design, engineering, labor, supervision, materials, equipment, tools, parts, supplies and transportation to perform all work described in the specifications.

The FEDS is a turbo-shaft engine test stand which uses automated data acquisition/instrumentation and air dynamometer technology to test and verify flight readiness of turbine engines removed from aircraft for maintenance.  A component of the FEDS is the VAROC 250 dynamometers.  The Army manages sixteen VAROC 250 Dynamometers required to test the Army's large helicopter engines.  Because of additional requirements for testing upgraded and new engines, the VAROC 250 needs to be upgraded to meet new capability requirements.
