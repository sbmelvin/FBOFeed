<DESC>Solicit comments on Potential Use of Project Labor Agreements for the Aircraft Apron and Airfield Improvements located at Ft Eustis, Virginia. <br />Source Sought for PLAs Regarding Solicitation: W91236-17-R-0001
<p>Description: The Norfolk District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for the Aircraft Apron and Airfield Improvements located at Ft. Eustis, Virginia. The project will relocate existing training facilities, construct all site infrastructure, entry control point, airfield pavements, Central Electrical Plants, ancillary supporting facilities and improve access road. Project will relocate existing training facilities and construction of new standard design urban assault course and covered bleacher in alternate location. Airfield pavements include taxiways, approximately 450 feet long taxiway bridge, taxiway lighting with controls, aircraft parking apron, and access apron. The new taxiway bridge will connect the project site to the existing operational runway. The supporting facilities include an entry control facility, aircraft ground support equipment storage, vehicle storage and covered parking, supporting facility Central Electrical Plant buildings and Fire Pump house and water storage tanks. Entry control facility includes entry control guard station. Access road improvement will ensure tractor trailer access to the project site following construction. Sustainability &amp; energy measures and building information systems are included. Supporting facilities include electric service; water, sewer, and gas; paving, walks, curbs, and gutters; storm drainage; site improvements; information systems; anti-terrorism measures and perimeter security fence; and emergency generators. The project site is remote, requiring long utility runs, surrounded by wetlands and has a stormwater management requirements, which contribute to unusually high supporting facilities cost. The end result will provide unit with a new 354,000SF aviation complex facility on approximately 45 acres currently used for aircraft sling load training.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: $50,000,000 - $100,000,000.</p>
<p>Period of Performance is approximately 22 months after Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:<br />a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br />b. The complexity of the project<br />c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region<br />d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.<br />f. The promotion of the Government's long term program interest such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />h. Additional costs form use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).<br />Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organization if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p>1. Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation.</p>
<p>2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project?

All questions shall be submitted in accordance with the instructions found under Section L of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The HELIOS SSD and select J-Attachment addendums are classified SECRET which precludes NAVSEA from posting the document on the FBO website (https://www.fbo.gov).

Upon receipt, the Contracting Officer will be able to provide the requested documents (classified documents will be mailed to the Contractor's Facility Security Officer). The Government will not provide sponsorship for new or upgraded personnel or facility clearances.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: In order to be considered for contract award, each company must be able to receive classified documents up to the SECRET level. Therefore, prime contractors interested in bidding under any subsequent solicitation must be able to receive classified documents up to the SECRET level and must be a United States (U.S.) company or an independent U.S. subsidiary. Offerors must be a United States (US) company or an independent US subsidiary, although foreign contractors may act as subcontractors to U.S. prime contractors. The export of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data is subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and requires the issuance of an export license by the U.S. Department of State.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This notice is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to award contracts. Future updates and information will be announced via FedBizOpps and interested parties must comply with those announcements. Interested parties are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for updates to this notice. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice.</p>

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.
