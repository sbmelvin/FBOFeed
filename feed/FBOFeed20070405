<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to implement a Targeted HIV Prevention Program for Most-At-Risk-Populations (MARPS) throughout Ethiopia in partnership with PEPFAR Ethiopia partners and the Government of Ethiopia.

Activities are expected to support targeted condom promotion services for and help increase condom availability to MARPS.  With the relatively limited level of anticipated funding, USAID foresees that technical assistance will be the primary type of intervention provided through the Contract.  The Contractor, therefore, will need to work with local and other PEPFAR partners to mobilize their resources to cover the operation of most of the necessary condom promotion, distribution and service-delivery functions that are envisioned.

The Contractor shall use existing behavioral and HIV prevalence information, market analyses, and assessments of specific MARPS to:  

-	develop and implement condom promotion activities for targeted MARPS; 
-	contribute to preventing new HIV infections by addressing important bridging populations; 
-	position, develop, promote and help distribute a selected condom product; 
-	support generic and product specific condom promotion efforts implemented by other USG partners contributing to the PEPFAR Ethiopia program and Non-USG partners operating in Ethiopia;
-	and, strengthen the capacity of Ethiopian organizations to accurately promote condoms in HIV prevention efforts for MARPS.  

In undertaking these tasks, the Contractor is expected to:  
-	conduct new market analyses and MARP assessments; 
-	produce and distribute new promotional materials (generic and brand-specific); 
-	provide technical leadership and technical assistance to the Ministry of Health (MOH) and USG partners on condom programming to reach targeted MARPS; 
-	monitor and analyze the effectiveness of interventions among MARPS; and 
-	develop condom promotion and product provision activities for specific high risk settings and geographic areas in several regions.  

To achieve the desired outcomes, intensive new promotion of condom information and product among specific MARPS will be necessary, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas as well as transportation corridors where HIV transmission and prevalence appears higher.  Close collaboration with USG and non-USG partners will be required to make condoms more accessible to MARPS, coordinate ABC messaging and establish linkages to other on-going HIV prevention, care and treatment activities.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Micro-Sensors for Imaging. The objective of this effort is to develop technologies for extremely light weight micro-cameras sensitive in the visible to short wave and in longer wave infrared; and to demonstrate such camera systems in micro-vehicles and head mounted applications.  The proposed research should investigate and exploit innovative approaches that will enable revolutionary advances in science, materials, detectors, focal plane arrays, micro-packaging, optics, electronics and signal processing leading to extremely light weight cameras.  Specifically excluded is research, which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice

The primary goal of this program is to establish the micro-systems technology for extremely light weight, low power cameras with the performance necessary for medium to short range applications.  The components comprising the light weight camera include the optics, packaged detector, electronics and camera housing. Innovations in optical and detecting materials; sensor design and fabrication, signal processing, and micro-packaging are necessary to achieve goals for extremely light weight.  

PROGRAM SCOPE   
 	
This program addresses development of sensor technology critical to micro-vehicle and head-mounted system applications, integration of sensor technology into a package consistent with the application, and demonstration of system prototypes.  Micro-air and micro-ground platforms and helmet mounted applications require:  sensor operation at room temperature or with extremely low power cooling and temperature stabilization, sensor micro-package with operational lifetime consistent with military operations, and optics and electronics consistent with the platform.  The first phase of the program shall demonstrate the feasibility of integrating an imaging array into a micro-package of the size and weight necessary for the application and with performance compatible with system goals.  This will include demonstration of the key attributes of the proposed approach, and paths to evaluate the risk.  The measured data shall be supported by models and calculations predicting performance.  Options may be exercised to continue the program after this initial demonstration.  

The second phase will consist of an integrated system feasibility demonstration for the proposed application. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled BAA 06-46, Micro-Sensors for Imaging Proposer Information Pamphlet which provides further information on Micro-Sensors for Imaging, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.

The Secretary of Education has waived this requirement to date for 57 LEAs in the State of Missouri and has arranged for third parties under contracts with the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to provide these required services.  All responsible sources must be aware of their duties for assuming the LEA's responsibility in meeting all statuatory and regulatory requirements for providing equitable services.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Northeast Caribbean Region, Public Buildings Service, Project Management Division, Room 1639, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY 10278 (212) 264-9491 announces an opportunity for Construction Manager as agent (CMa) Services to support GSA?s Design and Construction Excellence Programs.  The GSA seeks a Construction Manager as agent (CMa) Firm for Design Review Phase Services (base contract) and Construction Management Phase Services (option) for the Facade Repair and Slate Roof Replacement Project for the U.S. Post Office & Courthouse, 271 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, NY.  This work will be performed in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  Solicitation No.GS02P-07-DTC-0009(N), Project No. INY07001.

The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is a historic structure located in the Civic Center of the Borough of Brooklyn, New York.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City Landmark.     The 598,268 gross square foot building occupies an entire city block, fronting on Cadman Plaza, a major public space around which many federal, state and municipal buildings are organized.  The building houses the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the U.S. Trustee, the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Postal Service.  Originally constructed as a Post Office and Courthouse in 1892, the building was enlarged in 1933.  The earlier, four-story (plus attic) structure that occupies the southern end of the site was designed by Mifflin Bell, then Supervising Architect of the Treasury, and is Romanesque Revival in style.  The exterior facades are built of granite-faced masonry bearing walls, embellished with carved ornament, dormers and turrets.  The eight-story 1933 addition that occupies the balance of the site was undertaken under the direction of James Wetmore, Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury.  In designing the addition, great effort was made to emulate the appearance of the 1892 structure.  While many architectural details are shared by both structures, the 1933 structure incorporated the use of terra cotta cladding secured directly to masonry walls with ferrous anchors, in lieu of granite, above the first floor.  Above this level, the use of granite was limited to the stonework surrounding the second floor windows.

This project will involve the replacement of nearly all the deteriorated terra cotta cladding on the facades of the 1933 structure with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials, restoration of all existing granite cladding on both buildings, and replacement of the entire slate roofing system on both structures, including the tower on the 1892 building.   The entire complex will remain fully occupied throughout the construction period.  The Estimated Construction Cost Range for this project is between $45,000,000 and $55,000,000.

The Scope of Work will include, but may not necessarily be limited to, the following work items:

?	Replacement of nearly all of the existing deteriorated terra cotta cladding with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials and new non-ferrous supports and anchorage devices on the facades, dormers and light well of the 1933 structure.
?	Retention, repair, restoration, re-pointing and cleaning of existing terra cotta at window surrounds on the facades, dormers and light well of the 1933 structure wherever possible.
?	Repair, restoration, cleaning, and re-pointing of the existing granite cladding on the facades of both the 1892 and 1933 structures.
?	Repair of corroded perimeter structural steel elements.
?	Replacement of the entire slate roofing system on both structures, including the tower on the 1892 building,  to match the appearance and character of the existing slate roof, including associated wood decking and lead coated copper gutters, gutter boxes, flashing, valleys and ridges.
?	Redesign of flashing at the 7th floor cornice on the 1933 building to reduce the threat of falling ice to pedestrians below during the winter.
?	Installation of an access and fall protection/prevention system in compliance with all applicable OSHA regulations at the slate mansard roof on both structures to facilitate periodic maintenance of perimeter gutters and drains. 
?	Hazardous materials investigation and abatement associated with the above work items.

The design will follow the Secretary of Interior?s Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Historic Building Preservation Plan (HBPP) guidance, respecting the historic character of the building while accomplishing the project requirements to correct the deficiencies in the exterior envelope of the building and to preclude further fa?ade deterioration and damage to the structure and the recently renovated historic interior.  The Government will select one Construction Manager  as agent (CMa) via this solicitation and up to three (3) Construction Contractors via a separate solicitation to provide pre-construction services.  The Construction Contractors will provide design phase consultations evaluating costs, schedule, alternative design implications, building systems, construction materials and constructability.  The CMa will assist the GSA in managing the design and construction with an emphasis on meeting the project?s goals relating to schedule, budget, scope and quality.  At the conclusion of the Bid Phase, one (1) of the Construction Contractors will be selected to serve as the General Contractor providing construction services.  This selected Construction Contractor will serve as the single point of responsibility during construction, contracting directly with subcontractors.   The Government will solicit proposals under a source selection process for the Construction Contractor.  The CMa firm that will be selected via this solicitation will not have a contractual relationship with either the Construction Contractor or the subcontractors.

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of CMa Firms interested in contracting for this work.

  a.  Study Components
i.	Identification and Evaluation
1.	Historic Resources
Background research.   City, County and State surveys for historic resources shall be consulted in order to locate previously identified resources within the project APE.  Survey forms for any previously identified resources within the APE shall be copied and location of the resources located on the appropriate USGS topographic map.  Files of existing and proposed National Register properties shall be consulted in the City, County or SHPO offices.  A copy of each National Register Nomination Form and National Register Summary Form shall be copied for each listed and proposed National Register property located within the APE.
Field Survey.  A field survey shall be conducted in order to identify and locate all listed and eligible National Register properties (including those within historic districts or multiple resource areas).  State Survey Guidelines shall be followed.
Survey Form.  Appropriate State Survey Forms shall be completed for each previously unevaluated historic resource located within the APE which are 50 years or older.  State Survey Manual guidelines shall be used as the reference document for completing these forms.
Requests for Determinations of Eligibility.  In addition to the survey form, requests for Determinations of Eligibility (DOE) shall be prepared by performing all necessary primary and secondary source research.  DOE documentation shall include appropriate Historic Property Information Forms (HPIF) for each previously unevaluated historic resource.  Unless otherwise specified, the information shall include current 35mm color or black and white photographs of the existing historic resources and condition thereof, copies of historic photographs if available, and a sketch of the existing and original floor plans.  Current exterior and interior photographs of the existing historic resource(s) shall be numbered, labeled, and keyed to a sketch of the existing floor plan.  In addition, date of construction of the original building(s) and any additions which were added shall be noted.  Additions to historic resources shall be clearly marked on a location map showing the original building footprint.  State property information forms shall be used as the reference document for gathering the information.
National Register Evaluation.  Apply the National Register Criteria (36 CFR, Part 63) to each existing historic resource on and facing the site that is not already listed in the NRHP.  Provide GSA with recommendations as to the eligibility or ineligibility of each resource for inclusion in the NRHP individually and/or as part of a historic district, including a justification for recommendation.
For any historic resource recommended as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and for those already included in the NRHP, the Contractor shall identify those elements or characteristics of the resource that do and do not contribute to its eligibility, including a justification for each recommendation.
2.	Archaeological Resources
Conduct a Phase I archaeological survey of the project site, and provide GSA with recommendations concerning the probability that archaeological resources eligible for inclusion in the NRHP exist on the site.  An extensive background literature review shall be conducted to document previously identified archaeological sites and to delineate areas of high site potential within and adjacent to the project area, to develop prehistoric and historic contexts for the survey corridor.  Background research shall include review of relevant documents housed with the SHPO, Office of the State Archaeologist, State Site Files, State Department of Archives and History, and the Surveyor General?s Collections.  The States? preservation plan shall also be consulted.  The study must address the following:	
?	Is it likely that significant historic or prehistoric archaeological sites, if they exist, are preserved there in whole or in part?
?	What significance (research or other) would any such site have?
?	If there is significance, would such a site be eligible for inclusion on the NRHP?
?	Is Phase II archaeological study or site testing needed to clarify the presence/absence and/or significance of archaeological resources on the project site, and if so, why?
?	Provide scope of work for any recommended site testing or Phase II evaluation.
?	If archaeological monitoring is recommended for affected sites, these activities may be required as part of this project phase. 
b.	 Effect Determination
  1.     Historic Resources

The contractor shall determine the likely effects of the undertaking on all identified listed or eligible National Register historic resources.  The contractor shall provide GSA with a determination of effect for each historic resource (no historic properties affected, no adverse effect, or adverse effect).  The determination of effect documentation shall include a discussion of direct and indirect effects to the historic resources, a justification for the determination, alternatives to avoid adverse effects, plans to minimize harm and proposed mitigation, if applicable.

2.   Archaeological Resources

The Contractor shall provide GSA with a determination of effect for each National Register eligible archaeological resource which is likely to exist on the project site.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Govenrment personnel to a!  ccess your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to su bmit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for ass!  istance can be found on ORCA’s homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx.

<ARCHDATE>05302007
<CONTACT>Peggy Smith 703.432.0894
<DESC>The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) is soliciting proposals for research, development, integration, and demonstration of next-generation vessel stopping non-lethal weapons (NLW) and capabilities.  The objective of this BAA is to stimulate research, development, prototyping, testing, and maturation of NLW vessel stopping technologies in an attempt to address known NLW vessel stopping technology gaps. Proposals supported by this BAA should overcome the current limitations of existing vessel stopping NL systems.  These limitations generally include but are not limited to: 1)	Range, accuracy and precision. 2)	Effectiveness and the ability to quantify it. 3)	Providing a universal, repeatable and robust NL effect. 4)	Target safety, particularly across a wide-spectrum of the population. 5)	Deployability, to include weight and volume. 6)	Employability, to include use in complex maritime environments. 7)	High unit costs, non-reusable Submissions should specifically address technology and research objectives to: A)	Research and/or develop and/or test and/or improve design through innovative approaches in order to effectively demonstrate state-of-the art aerial deployed vessel stopping and/or entanglement approaches for port security, homeland defense, and maritime interdiction. The technical approach demonstrated should be effective in safely stopping/arresting or significantly impeding the movement of vessels while minimizing damage to the target vessel. EVALUATION CRITERIA: Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria in descending order of importance:  1)	Quality and Technical Merit.  2)	Contributions/Relevance to Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP) and Department of Defense (DoD).  3)	Capabilities, Experience, and past performance.  4)	Plans and Capabilities to Accomplish Technology Transfer. 5)	Total Cost and Cost Realism.  See attached Proposer Information Package (PIP) for a further explanation on specific evaluation criteria. All awards made in response to this BAA will be subject to availability of government funds. Evaluations and selection or non-selection of proposals for funding will be made on the basis of the evaluation criteria listed.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  The JNLWD has available approximately $1.1 million for this effort. Multiple awards typically of 12-36 month duration are possible. Offerors should prepare proposals with a baseline period of performance of 12 months and include one or two options each with a 12-month period of performance based on an anticipated contract award date of June 2007. The 12-month baseline or Phase I of the proposal shall have as a minimum two (2) system or NLW capability demonstrations or program milestones within the first 12 month period of performance so as to provide data/evidence/support for consideration for follow-on or year 2 funding.  This BAA will remain open for one (1) year after the release date. Technical proposals are not to exceed fifteen pages and must be accompanied by a full cost proposal valid until 31 December 2007 and include one “QUAD-Chart” (the cost proposal and the Quad-Chart are not part of the five page limit). The offer must be provided in electronic format commensurate with a Microsoft Office software product (e.g., Word, Excel, or PowerPoint).  Submission shall be via email to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Peggy Smith, peggy.l.smith1@usmc.mil .  Note:  Due to email server and pipeline limitations, please limit the size of each email with attachments to 3 megabytes.  It is the Offeror’s responsibility to 1) read the BAA and all related documents carefully and completely, 2) ensure/verify the Government receives their submission on or before the date/time specified, and 3) monitor NECO for any updates on the BAA on a regular basis. In order to be considered for FY2007 funding, technical and full cost proposals are due on or before 4:00 PM (EST) 30 April 2007. Similarly, proposals are due on or before 4:00 PM (EST) 30 November 2007 in order to be considered for FY08 funding.  It is the policy of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Nondisclosure notices notwithstanding, employees of JNLWD and support contractors, American Systems Corporation and Booz, Allen and Hamilton, may handle proposals for administrative and evaluation purposes; however, only Government evaluators will make final selections under this BAA. This announcement, in conjunction with the pamphlet BAA07 Vessel Stopping Proposer Information Package (PIP), constitutes the Broad Agency Announcement as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). Addresses for obtaining the PIP are provided at the end of this notice. A formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. In addition, the Government reserves the right to award multiple contracts, grants, or other instruments determined to be of benefit to the government in achieving the goals and objectives of this program.  Award(s) is/are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any other JNLWP and/or Marine Corps contracts through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number. Affirmation shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission.

The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit proposals, which will be evaluated. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research related to Non-Lethal Weapons developments.  ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION: Offerors are required to obtain the BAA Vessel Stopping Proposer Information Package (PIP) which will be made available to industry through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program website: https://JNLWP.com.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Micro-Sensors for Imaging. The objective of this effort is to develop technologies for extremely light weight micro-cameras sensitive in the visible to short wave and in longer wave infrared; and to demonstrate such camera systems in micro-vehicles and head mounted applications.  The proposed research should investigate and exploit innovative approaches that will enable revolutionary advances in science, materials, detectors, focal plane arrays, micro-packaging, optics, electronics and signal processing leading to extremely light weight cameras.  Specifically excluded is research, which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice

The primary goal of this program is to establish the micro-systems technology for extremely light weight, low power cameras with the performance necessary for medium to short range applications.  The components comprising the light weight camera include the optics, packaged detector, electronics and camera housing. Innovations in optical and detecting materials; sensor design and fabrication, signal processing, and micro-packaging are necessary to achieve goals for extremely light weight.  

PROGRAM SCOPE   
 	
This program addresses development of sensor technology critical to micro-vehicle and head-mounted system applications, integration of sensor technology into a package consistent with the application, and demonstration of system prototypes.  Micro-air and micro-ground platforms and helmet mounted applications require:  sensor operation at room temperature or with extremely low power cooling and temperature stabilization, sensor micro-package with operational lifetime consistent with military operations, and optics and electronics consistent with the platform.  The first phase of the program shall demonstrate the feasibility of integrating an imaging array into a micro-package of the size and weight necessary for the application and with performance compatible with system goals.  This will include demonstration of the key attributes of the proposed approach, and paths to evaluate the risk.  The measured data shall be supported by models and calculations predicting performance.  Options may be exercised to continue the program after this initial demonstration.  

The second phase will consist of an integrated system feasibility demonstration for the proposed application. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled BAA 06-46, Micro-Sensors for Imaging Proposer Information Pamphlet which provides further information on Micro-Sensors for Imaging, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: www.grants.gov, DARPA website: http://www.darpa.mil/ (go to "solicitations", "MTO"), or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.

Any questions regarding this  cancellation may be directed to Mr. Drew Titone at AFMC/A7CCI, telephone  (937) 656-2947 or email drew.titone@wpafb.af.mil" ASC/CVH, 1450 Littrell Road, Room 7, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 intends to negotiate with The Properties at Wright Field, LLC, 4334  Glendale- Milford Road, Cincinnati, OH 45242-3706 on a sole source basis for the privatization of an additional 496 units of military family housing at  Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, in a Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction.  The transaction will not be funded directly with appropriated funds, but  instead will be funded from tenant rental payments, including allotments from individual military service members’ monthly basic allowance for housing payments.  Such transactions require the developer to renovate, construct, maintain, repair, operate and manage for a period of approximately 50  years. Estimated Transaction Closing: 1 October 2004 THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE  FOLLOW-ON TO A PRIOR COMPETITIVELY-AWARDED NON-FAR REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION with The Properties at Wright Field, LLC, to privatize an initial quantity of 1536 residential units at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. NO  DATA/DRAWINGS AVAILABLE. The approximate solicitation issue date will be December 2003. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2872 et seq.  Justification:  The agency has  concluded that the follow-on real estate privatization functions required are  uniquely available from only one source, because only the current privatization developer is able to satisfy the agency’s needs to reduce the total number  of family housing units at Wright-Patterson AFB while maintaining units in  on-base locations, to assure that only military families reside in core security  areas of the base, and to assure that non-military families, if permitted to  rent under the tenant eligibility waterfall which is invoked in the event of  low military occupancy rates, can be diverted to remote/peripheral units where security is less a concern. An attempt to compete this requirement would  also result in substantial duplication of costs not recoverable through competition.  This synopsis is issued for information only and is not a  request for competitive proposals. Developers interested in providing an offer  must be able to demonstrate in writing, by two weeks from date this synopsis is published, their capability to privatize the required units despite lack  of priority referrals and despite lack of a waterfall permitting filling  vacancies in core base areas with non-military tenants.  Information received will  be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the agency not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within  the discretion of the agency. The agency will not pay for any information  received. A sole source, Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction RFP will be posted at www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil on or about 1 February 2004.    It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities  in connection with the described real estate transaction contact the  incumbent developer listed. The point of contact for this real estate transaction  and any submissions, is the Original Point of Contact listed below.

<SUBJECT>Z -- Construction Services Contract for the Facade Repair and Slate Roof Replacement of the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse, 271 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, NY
<SOLNBR>GS-02P-07-DTC-0017(N)

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Northeast and Caribbean Region is pleased to announce an opportunity for Construction Excellence for the Façade Repair and Slate Roof Replacement of the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse located at 271 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, NY.  GSA is seeking a Construction/General Contractor to perform both PreConstruction and Construction Services for this project. 

The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse is an historic structure located in the Civic Center of the Borough of Brooklyn, New York.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City Landmark.     The 575,000 gross square foot building occupies an entire city block, fronting on Cadman Plaza, a major public space around which many federal, state and municipal buildings are organized.  The building houses the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the U.S. Trustee, the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Postal Service.  Originally constructed as a Post Office and Courthouse in 1892, the building was enlarged in 1933.  The earlier, four-story (plus attic) structure that occupies the southern end of the site was designed by Mifflin Bell, then Supervising Architect of the Treasury, and is Romanesque Revival in style.  The exterior facades are built of granite-faced masonry bearing walls, embellished with carved ornament, dormers and turrets.  The eight-story 1933 addition that occupies the balance of the site was undertaken under the direction of James Wetmore, Acting Supervising Architect of the Treasury.  In designing the addition, great effort was made to emulate the appearance of the 1892 structure.  While many architectural details are shared by both structures, the 1933 structure incorporated the use of terra cotta cladding secured directly to masonry walls with ferrous anchors, in lieu of granite, above the first floor.  Above this level, the use of granite was limited to the stonework surrounding the second floor windows.

This project will involve the replacement of nearly all the deteriorated terra cotta cladding on the facades of the 1933 structure with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials, restoration of all existing granite cladding on both buildings, and replacement of the entire slate mansard roofing system on both structures.   The entire complex will remain fully occupied throughout the construction period.  The design will follow the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Historic Building Preservation Plan (HBPP) guidance, respecting the historic character of the building while accomplishing the project requirements to correct the deficiencies in the exterior envelope of the building and to preclude further façade deterioration and damage to the structure and the recently renovated historic interior.

Through the Construction Excellence program, GSA will employ the best practices that will result in the best project for the best value; procure the highest quality construction services as early as practical; and establish reliable budgets and the ability to manage them. 

The scope of services for this project will include providing design phase consultations evaluating costs, schedule, alternative design implications, building systems, construction materials and constructability. Optional services will include construction of the project. 

The Scope of Work for the Construction Services Option will include, but may not necessarily be limited to, the following work items:

•	Replacement of nearly all of the existing deteriorated terra cotta cladding with new terra cotta or approved alternate materials and new non-ferrous supports and anchorage devices on the facades, dormers and light well of the 1933 structure.
•	Retention, repair, restoration, re-pointing and cleaning of existing terra cotta at window surrounds on the facades, dormers and light well of the 1933 structure wherever possible.
•	Repair, restoration, cleaning, and re-pointing of the existing granite cladding on the facades of both the 1892 and 1933 structures.
•	Replacement of the entire slate roofing system on both structures, including the tower on the 1892 building,  to match the appearance and character of the existing slate roof, including associated wood decking and lead coated copper gutters, gutter boxes, flashing, valleys and ridges.
•	Installation of an access and fall protection/prevention system in compliance with all applicable OSHA regulations at the slate mansard roof on both structures to facilitate periodic maintenance of perimeter gutters and drains. 
•	Hazardous materials investigation and abatement associated with the above work items.

The Overall Estimated Construction Cost Range for this project is $45,000,000 to $55,000,000.

The procurement process will be performed in two (2) stages. The acquisition strategy for this project will be in accordance with Source Selection Processes and Techniques (FAR Part 15.1).  This will be a competitive acquisition, utilizing the tradeoff process approach under the Best Value Continuum (FAR 15.101).  This process permits tradeoffs among cost or price and technical factors and allows the government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal.  For this acquisition all technical evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. 

For Stage 1, offerors must submit a technical proposal responding to the following technical evaluation factors: 1) Experience on Similar Projects, 2) Past Performance on Similar Projects and 3) Qualifications of Key Personnel. The factors will be described in the solicitation. The Source Selection Evaluation Board will evaluate the technical proposals received against the factors identified for Stage I. Based on the evaluation of each proposal, a competitive range will be established in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(1). Then, in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(2), based on the results of the evaluation, the Contracting Officer will limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated offerors. For this procurement, the competition will be limited to the three (3) most highly rated offerors. 

The three most highly rated offerors found to be within the competitive range will EACH be issued a stipend in the amount of $120,000 and will proceed into Stage 2 of the procurement process. The stipend will be paid to each offeror for their total effort related to the services rendered during Stage 2. 

Those firms found to be within the competitive range will assist the GSA with the A-E’s Design by performing the review and evaluation of the design and construction documents.  The offerors will be required to work with GSA in a cooperative team effort to develop a quality design which is within budget. Each offeror will be required to notify GSA of all issues regarding design submissions that appear inadequate and which may have the potential to jeopardize the project’s goals relating to schedule, cost, quality or scope. 

The Stage 2 submission will include a Technical and Price proposal.  The Stage 2 technical proposal will include the following technical evaluation factors: 4) Design and Constructability Review and Oral Presentations; 5) Management Plan and Oral Presentations. 

At the conclusion of the design review services, the participating offerors will propose a Firm Fixed Price for the construction services option required under this acquisition.  Award of the required construction services option will be based on the evaluation of the offeror’s proposed Firm Fixed Price and a comparative assessment of the offerors’ technical proposals against the source selection evaluation criteria identified within the solicitation. Factors 4 and 5 are equal in importance to Factors 1 and 2, which are more important than Factor 3.  All the technical evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.

The offeror’s firm fixed price proposals for the Construction Services Option will not be assigned a numerical weight, point score or adjectival rating.  GSA will use price analysis to evaluate the price proposal, not only to determine whether it is fair and reasonable, but also to determine the offeror’s understanding of the work and their ability to perform the requirements stipulated within this acquisition.  Although the Government anticipates awarding the Construction Services Option without discussions, if discussions are conducted the competitive range will include all three offerors from Stage I, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency.  .

Stage 1 submissions (technical proposals) will be due by 1:30pm, May 16, 2007. The RFP will include all the submission requirements. This procurement is being issued under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program, and will be open to both large and small business concerns. Before award of the contract, the firm (if not a small business of $28,500,000 gross average sales/receipts for the past three years) shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507.

As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, GSA will establish subcontracting goals for Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Small Business, Hubzone Small Business and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns. In support of the agency’s effort, firms seeking consideration for this contract shall demonstrate a proactive effort in achieving these goals, and will place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent with the small business categories listed above. GSA anticipates hosting a Subcontracting Opportunities Networking session for this project.  The Networking session is intended to affirm GSA’s recognition of the talent that exists in the small business community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between the community and the firms which are considering submitting proposals on this project.  

The contract award or GSA exercise of any option is contingent upon the availability of funds.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about April 17, 2007. GSA will be holding a PreProposal conference for the Stage 1 submissions. The date and time for this conference will be issued under a separate announcement. If you are interested in submitting a proposal for this project, please contact Frank Cashman via email at francis.cashman@gsa.gov or call (212) 264-4234.

<SOLNBR>ICE2CEILING
<RESPDATE>041407
<ARCHDATE>04292007
<CONTACT>Cathy Schoonover, Supervisory Contract Specialist, Phone (478) 926-8374, Fax (478) 926-2842, Email Cathy.Schoonover@robins.af.mil
<DESC>PURPOSE:  The purpose of this posting is to announce the need to revise the contract ceiling on the Intelligence Information, Command & Control, Equipment & Enhancements (ICE2), Contract Number F09603-03-D-0095, and to determine if there are any contractors who possess the capability to assume this workload within the next twelve (12) to eighteen (18) months. 

DESCRIPTION:  The scope of the ICE2 effort is to provide worldwide sustainment, maintenance and technical support effort for Intelligence and Command and Control systems.  The equipment supported by this contract consists of commercial, modified-commercial, and specially designed equipment items.  Departments and agencies supported by this multi-service contract include, but are not limited to, the Departments of the Air Force, Army, Navy, State, Energy, Treasury, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Unified Commands, Coast Guard, Air National Guard, Special Operations Forces, Joint Reserve Intelligence Program, National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and the National Reconnaissance Office.  

The ICE2 contract was awarded on 11 June 2003 as an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to a single source, General Dynamics, Needham, MA, based upon full and open competition.  This contract contains a basic four-year ordering period with two, three-year incentive options making the potential length of the contract a maximum of ten years.  

ACTION REQUIRED:  Contractual action is required to increase the contract ceiling.  It is necessary to increase the ceiling due to unanticipated high level of support due to the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) as a result of the events of September 11, 2001 and the resulting mission requirement changes in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.  All work to be performed under the contract is considered to be in accordance with the original statement of requirements; however, GWOT increased the amount of work to be accomplished to an amount not contemplated in the original ceiling price.  As a result of the requirements placed against the contract supporting GWOT, the original established contract ceiling of $1.95B is expected to be reached in contract year five.  An increase in the ceiling will provide for continued critical support of various projects for all the services that are affected by this contract to include, but not limited to, the Departments of the Air Force, Army, Navy, State, Energy, Treasury, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Unified Commands, Coast Guard, Air National Guard, Special Operations Forces, Joint Reserve Intelligence Program, National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and the National Reconnaissance Office.  The increase will ensure sufficient contract ceiling is available for new tasks supporting the mission of the United States Government as a result of September 11.  

RESPONSE REQUIRED:  As stated above, one purpose of this posting is to determine if there are any contractors who possess the capability to assume this workload within the next twelve (12) to eighteen (18) months.  This would include the requirement for personnel (currently in excess of 2300 worldwide, performing in residential, deployed and per-call scenarios) who currently hold Top Secret / Secure Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) Clearances.  Responses should be submitted to Cathy Schoonover, 560 ACSG / GFKAB, 478-926-8374, cathy.schoonover@robins.af.mil, no later than     16 APRIL 2007.

FUTURE ACTION:  A competitive follow-on acquisition, similar in scope to this current requirement, is planned to replace this contract.  Acquisition planning has begun for the follow-on; award is contemplated in FY09.  It is anticipated that a synopsis regarding the follow-on will be posted on or about 01 Nov 07.

<DESC>1)  The technical issue is as follows: (The maximum flow rate is 750 ml/min, 50% higher than the essential requirement, for example.) However there is one exception: The system we sell to the Army, which is in use in combat support hospitals and forw ard surgical teams throughout the war zone, and elsewhere, weighs slightly more than the specified wt. in the essential requirements. The specified weight is 26 pounds, and the weight of the device is about 27.8 pounds. The system we ship has a battery bui lt into it, which is not in the essential requirements, and the unit will still operate without it, which would reduce the weight to under 26 pounds. However we recommend the battery because it keeps the system operating without heat, but with pumping and all alarms during a memomentary brownout or loss of power, and the system automatically resumes normal operation when line power is restored. The overall weight of the system with manuals, power cord, portable IV pole (an extra), and the waterproof shippin g case, accessories, etc. is under the 65 pound requirement, so that the overall shipping weight is not an issue, just the weight of the device itself. We would like to supply the device as it is used by the military throughout the world, which has the sli ghtly higher weight. Please advise. *****Yes, we prefer a militarily relevant product, even if it is beyond the listed weight/cube specified in the RFP. 2)  Regarding 3rd clarification bullet/question.  What we are trying to understand is how rates higher than 500 mL will be evaluated in connection with the best value determination. Similarly, in connection with our questions about set up time, priming, an d advanced capabilities, it is hard to understand how 'better' technical capabilities will be treated in connection with the best value determination. If you can clarify this, it would be a very great help to understanding what the Army really wants from c ompetitors.  *****This is a clinical determination.  We will have clinical input to the Source Selection Board providing guidance in this area during proposal evaluation.  The clinicians' input will help the contracting officer determine enhancements above the essentia l characteristics in the solicitation.   Due to the limited number of days remaining (04/16/07 by 2:00pm) before the solicitation closes; we request that you please do not submit any additional questions.

<ARCHDATE>04042008
<CONTACT>LYNDA MCCARTHY CONTRACT sPECIALIST 7036487394     ;
<DESC>In the mid 1990s, the USGS developed leading edge services including Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Mapping Services (WMS), map viewing, download, user defined clip and ship, and other capabilities into mechanisms at multiple locations including EROS Data Center's Seamless Server. The USGS now seeks information on industry capabilities, products, services and potential sources for components that might comprise Service/Server Mechanism(s) for the Rapid Loading and Dissemination (RL&D) of Vector data, Imagery and Gridded data, and associated Metadata.  While the initial focus is on raster and gridded data, as defined in ISO/TR 19121, Imagery and Gridded Data, to support the primary requirement of emergency operations, the USGS does not want to unnecessarily set architectural barriers or limitations upon the possible extension of the Mechanism to provide/accommodate/support all types of geospatial data: raster, gridded, vector, and feature data, and their associated metadata.  Technologies and capabilities that offer flexible expansibility/extensibility in their application are preferable. The USGS requests that interested vendors provide a written response providing the information requested in the Request for Information (RFI) which is located at http://www.usgs.gov/contracts/docs/RLD/RLDRFI.doc.  While not required, an indication of approximate one-time and recurring costs and resources investment level, in as much detail as the vendor is willing to provide, for establishing and operating the envisioned Mechanism(s). Vendors are encouraged to forward any questions in writing to Lynda L. McCarthy, Contract Specialist, at lmccarthy@usgs.gov by 2:00pm, EDT, April 17, 2007.   Vendors are required to word questions in such a way that the entire question can be publicized without concerns of releasing confidential or proprietary information.  Questions and answers will be publicly posted to a USGS web page established for this RFI.  Vendors will be notified of the web page through a modification to this synopsis on or about April 30, 2007.   DISCLAIMER:  THE RFI IS ISSUED SOLELY FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) 15.201(e), RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT.  RESPONDENTS ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO THIS RFI.  RESPONDENTS NEEDING CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT FOR ANY PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THEY FURNISH MUST COMPLY WITH THE USGS's CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REGULATIONS, 17 C.F.R. 200.83 (CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROCEDURES UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT).  RESPONSES TO THIS RFI WILL NOT BE RETURNED.  RESPONDENTS WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULT OF THE REVIEW.

The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the current baseline products – however, to support more users, additional licenses and support is needed.   Microstrategy software is the basis for measuring the performance of ILMS.  The software and support services needed to accomplish this task in ILMS include: MicroStrategy WebReporter, MicroStrategy Office,  MicroStrategy Web Professional,  MicroStrategy Intelligence Server,  MicroStrategy Report Services,  MicroStrategy OLAP Services,  MicroStrategy SDK, and MicroStrategy Bronze Technical Support A full description of the software and support services that are required can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for MicroStrategy.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the MicroStrategy software, the required software and support is available only from MicroStrategy.  The software and support described in paragraph 3 is crucial for measuring the performance of ILMS.   ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system.  ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000.  ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System.  In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc.  ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the MicroStrategy software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support.  Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure software and support from MicroStrategy would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the ability to measure the performance of ILMS.<BR><BR>

Includes tube, standard cap with clamshell cable clamp, instrument flange and collar for standard Nortek instrument and 316 instrument safety cable.  Color:  4 pipes in RED, 2 pipes in GREEN.  3)  Twelve (12) each u-Bolts and Washers for Clamparaatus.  4)  Thirty-two (32) each Shoulder Bushings for Clamparatus.  The delivery time for the items is 30 days after receipt of order.  Items to be delivered FOB Destination to NOAA/NOS, Requirements & Development Division, 808 Principal Court, Chesapeake, VA  23320l.  In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the central contractor registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract.  For information regarding registration in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.  Authority:  41 USC 253(c)(1).  The FSC for this is 2040 and the NAICS Code is 334511, small business size standard is 750 employees.  The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement.  Oceanscience Group is the only known source capable of providing the required equipment.  Oceansciences designed and built this mount prior to use by NOAA.  Oceanscience owns the design.  This is the only known design that has been accepted by the US Coast Guard for use on their Buoys.  The required mounting system specifications:  use of a multiple module design (ADCP, power pack, radio module) to ease installation; mount modules so as to minimize fasteners; eliminate corrosion (use non-metallic components or isolate dissimilar metals); make use of identical paints; have negligible effect on buoyancy.  The device doesn’t alter the form or function of a navigational buoy, while still providing current profiles from the buoy.  The ADCP and clamping mechanism are attached to the USCG aid to Navigation (buoy) after it is deployed and removed prior to buoy recovery for maintenance.  The battery operated device needs to be services only once a year to remove fouling and installation of new batteries.  A low powered radio link to a close point ashore provides data access..  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 4:00 P.M. April 11, 2007 will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Evidence must be provided of ability to perform the required analysis.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Linda.Mullen@noaa.gov.

STATEMENT OF WORK FOR 3 FOOT, 4 FOOT AND 5 FOOT MICROWAVE PYRAMIDAL FLAME-RETARDANT RADAR ABSORBING MATERIAL.

1.0 SCOPE: The 772nd Test Squadron of Edwards AFB, CA has a requirement to provide low frequency test capability in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF).  This low frequency capability requires the installation of large foam absorbers in order to eliminate multi-path reflections back to the System Under Test (SUT).  The purchase of 140 pieces of 60 inch pyramidal RAM, 140 pieces of 48 inch pyramidal RAM and 140 pieces of 36 inch pyramidal RAM, each with a base of 24 inches by 24 inches, is needed to provide the necessary attenuation at these frequencies.

2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:  1) IEEE Standard 1128 ? ?Recommended Practice for RF Absorber Performance Evaluation in the Range 30 MHz to 5Ghz.?  2) NRL Report 8093 ? ?Modified Smoldering Test of Urethane Foams Used in Anechoic Chambers.?

3.0 REQUIREMENTS:

   3.1 Testing for Frequency Performance.

3.1.1 Low Frequency Testing:  Each piece of RAM shall be uniquely numbered and tested.  Low frequency testing will be performed using a coaxial reflectometer according to IEEE Standard 1128.  The IEEE low frequency method requires RAM to be tested with eight 2 foot by 2 foot pieces at a time, which is acceptable to verify the low frequency performance.  The RAM must be tested from 80 Mhz to 500 Mhz and meet or exceed the stated attenuation values.  The required break points are listed in the table below: 

	Reflectivity Attenuation in dB @ Normal Incidence
for Various RAM Heights
Frequency (MHZ)	36 inch	48 inch	60 inch
80	N/A	15	15
120	N/A	20	20
200	N/A	30	30
300	30	35	35
500	40	40	40

Electronic and/or paper copies of the measured reflectivity data shall be delivered for each group of 8 pieces tested, indicating which serially numbered pieces were tested and whether or not they passed the reflection requirements defined in the table above.

3.1.2 High Frequency Testing:  High frequency reflectivity measurements are required for at least 10% of each sub-lot.  The frequency range required for this measurement is from 6 to 18 GHz at near normal incidence angle.  Test samples will be taken from sub-lots throughout all manufacturing runs.  Electronic and/or paper copies of the measured reflectivity data will be delivered for each set of RAM tested, indicating which serially numbered pieces were tested.

3.1.3  Data Delivery Requirements.  All data collected for low frequency and high frequency testing must be provided on or before date of RAM delivery.  The US Government will not accept any shipments of RAM which are not provided with the required associated data upon date of RAM delivery.  Each measurement plot must identify by serial number which pieces were tested for that plot.  Additionally, a table must be provided to show which serial numbers belong to which sub-lot.

   3.2 Manufacturing Constraints. 

3.2.1 Glue lines.  Due to the multi-use test nature of the BAF, glue lines are undesirable for high frequency BAF tests.  If any manufactured RAM will include any seams whatsoever, the seam location(s) must be provided and the RAM pieces with those seams must be identified by serial number.

3.2.2 Pyramid Design.  The RAM to be purchased for this SOW may be of either standard pyramid or twisted pyramid design.  In no case, however, should the manufacturer mix-and-match pyramid styles in the performance of this SOW.  All 36-inch, 48-inch and 60-inch RAM purchased under this SOW shall be of either standard pyramid or twisted pyramid design, but not both.

3.2.3 Footprint Size Tolerance.  Each piece must measure 24 inches square.  The BAF is marked with a 4 foot by 4 foot grid that has been permanently scored onto the entire concrete floor.  As such, RAM must fit onto that grid.  The RAM cannot be consistently oversized, but should instead be manufactured to a 24 inch by 24 inch base with a maximum size tolerance of +0.0 inch/-0.25 inch.

3.2.4 Cleanroom Requirement.  The RAM must not shed or leach carbon and/or fire retardants -- whether that is achieved by an inherent closed-cell design or a complete Latex-type coating over all surfaces -- including the bottom.  All RAM to be purchased as part of this SOW must not shed carbon particles during normal handling -- including dropping an upright piece of RAM from a height of 3 feet onto a concrete surface (with the bottom RAM surface impacting the concrete).  If used, the Latex-type coating on the bottom surface may be thicker than on other surfaces.

   3.3 Delivery Constraints. 
RAM delivery must be coordinated with the 772nd Test Squadron Director of Operations (772 TS/DO). The last delivery of the entire order should not exceed 4 weeks from the first delivery.

   3.4 Fire Retardancy
Independently test the flammability of the RAM?s manufacturing method to meet the fire retardancy required by NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3). 

   3.5 Physical Characteristics for RAM.
The physical description of the 36 inch, 48 inch and 60 inch pyramidal RAM is provided in the table below:
Overall Height	36, 48 and 60 inches +/-0.5 inch
Overall RAM Footprint	24 inches square +0.0/-0.25inch
Pyramids per piece	4 for 36 inch, 4 for 48 inch, 1 for 60 inch
Pyramid Shape	Conventional or twisted pyramid
Fire Retardancy	IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2 and 3)
Sealing (closed cell design or paint on all exposed surfaces must  prevent the release of carbon particles)	If paint is used, it must not degrade RAM performance below that required by paragraph 3.1
Color	If used, paint must be Light Blue (required on all surfaces including the bottom) ? otherwise, exposed RAM surfaces may be Black if closed cell design.
   3.6 Past Performance Requirements.
Provide evidence of previous contract success in meeting identical or similar requirements: 
a.	RAM manufactured to similar specifications (SOW Para 3.5).
b.	Meeting flammability testing requirements IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2 and 3).
c.	Ability to deliver a similar quantity of RAM within the time frame specified (SOW Para 3.3).

   3.7 Program Management.
The contractor shall notify the AFFTC Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR) in a timely manner concerning any issues that would adversely impact the contractor?s ability to meet and satisfy the performance or schedule requirements of this SOW.


Ship Date: 6 Months After Receipt of Order.  FOB: Destination Edwards AFB CA 93524.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS), Dissemination Systems Branch intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with International Radio & Electronics Corp. (IREC) (dba Crown Broadcast) of Elkhart IN 46515-2000 to provide ten (10) radio transmitters and spare parts to support the NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) Broadcast Network in Alaska and Puerto Rico.  These transmitters broadcast to the public critical issuances of watches, warnings and other emergency hazard information over the NOAA Weather Radio. Sustaining this service is critical for the prevention of loss of life and property. This action will replace older transmitters in the areas mentioned above which are failing and the availability of parts to maintain them is increasingly harder to acquire.  Crown Broadcast currently has hundreds of transmitters units already in use in association with the NWR program and is the sole manufacturer of these units. These units from Crown comply and conform to NOAA?s logistics, training, spare parts inventory and repair infrastructure currently in use in these remote sites. Selecting alternative models would result in significant costs for new training and logistical repair in these areas. In addition, these units must be in place in Alaska prior to the start of the start of the regions severe winter weather which begins in September. Vendors who believe that can satisfy the Government?s requirement are invited to submit an affirmative response. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to meet the existing training, and logistical requirements aforementioned. All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis. This is in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. A firm fixed-price delivery order is contemplated for this effort.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 27 April 2007.  Please submit any and all written responses to Mark Miller via e-mail at Mark.A.Miller@ noaa.gov  See Note 22.

This program will provide quality-assured reagents and resources to aid in the development, evaluation, validation and testing of influenza diagnostics and vaccines.  The Contractor who develops the Influenza Virus Library (IVL) under this potential contract will coordinate access to these reagents.  The potential IVL Contractor will acquire, propagate, characterize, provide quality control and store reference reagents; assemble standardized panels and establish and implement a system to oversee and manage the distribution of viruses and reagents to researchers and developers of influenza vaccines and influenza virus diagnostic products approved by the CDC Project Officer; and disseminate public information concerning reagent availability and technical assistance.  These reagents include human influenza, low and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and their derivatives, as well as other microbial respiratory pathogens associated with influenza-like illness.  Any work with live wild-type highly pathogenic influenza H5N1 viruses must be conducted in a USDA-approved Biosafety Level 3 -Enhanced containment facility.  

If your firm has the ability and interest to develop an Influenza Virus Library (IVL) such as described herein, please contact the contract specialist with your firm's name; address; voice and email contact information; alternate NAICS Code, if applicable; and business size.  If a small business, identify specific classification and basis for business size determination, annual revenue or number or employees.

<DESC>This announcement is a request for information. The Department of Defense (DOD),  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SSC) San Diego, is conducting market research and planning to determine the interest and capability of industry to participate in a competitive acquisition for detecting motion from a moving platform.  Motion Detection On-The- Move (M-DOTM) has been identified by the users of the Mobile Detection And Response Systems (MDARS) as one of their primary goals. The Mobile Detection Assessment Response System (MDARS) is a joint Army-Navy effort to field interior and exterior autonomous platforms for security and inventory assessment functions at DoD warehouses and storage sites. The program is managed by the Office of the Product Manager, Physical Security Equipment, (PM-PSE) at Ft. Belvoir, VA, with the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego) providing all technical direction and systems integration functions. Note: system must have the capability to operate without continuous monitoring or oversight. The responder needs to submit clear relevant information such as operating conditions, approximate false alarm rate, detection range, and technologies utilized. Relevant questions to be answered include but are not limited to: â€¢     What technologies are you employing? (Cameras, radars, lasers, sonars, etc.) â€¢     How far along is your development? Has it been tested in the field? Can it be demonstrated? Do you have any video? â€¢     What is the detection range? â€¢     What are the operational conditions (Day, night, clear, fog, rain, snow, desert, altitude, etc.) ? â€¢     What are the operational areas (urban, desert, clear of obstacles, bushes, trees, metal, etc.)? â€¢     What are the types of platform surface conditions (smooth road, maintained trail, unmaintained, etc.)? â€¢     What is the capability of detecting moving targets? At what platform operational speeds (min/max) ? â€¢     What is the capability of detecting moving targets? Moving at what speed (min/max)? â€¢     What is the target size? What is the number of pixels, cross- section? â€¢     Can the system handle multiple targets? â€¢     What is the false alarm rate? â€¢     What is the estimated probability of detection? â€¢     What is the number of sensors needed for 360 deg coverage? â€¢     What are systemâ€™s minimum and maximum operating ranges? â€¢     What is the resolution of the system at different detection ranges? â€¢     How are range, resolution and false alarm rates affected by environmental factors such as trees/plants, rain, snow, metal buildings, etc? â€¢     What are the maximum values of shock and vibration that the system can receive and still be functional (in terms of the system performance levels)? â€¢     What is the range of temperatures that the system can operation in? â€¢     What is the performance of the system when people are occluded by stationary objects or trees/plants? â€¢     Based on cost and performance is it better to use an array of stationary sensors or a rotating platform with a single sensor? â€¢     How many simultaneous targets can be tracked? â€¢     How is system performance affected as a function of the number of simultaneous targets being tracked? The planned procurement will include: (1) procurement and design of hardware suites; (2) integration and land based test site testing with government furnished application software; (3) systems and technical engineering services; (4) logistics support to include training,  training material development, technical data including test procedures, test reports, and drawings, spare parts procurement, installation labor, and testing.

<SUBJECT>D -- LabVIEW Enterprise Software License Support
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate a sole source award with National Instruments Corporation, Austin, Texas, under the authority of FAR SUBPART 13.5 – TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS (SEPT 2005) for “Enterprise Software License Support for the LabVIEW Full Development System for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux with the Standard Service Program.” National Instruments is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Agency requirements. The sole source determination is based on the unique capabilities of the proprietary software. Additionally, NIST currently maintains LabVIEW and this is an upgrade to the existing agreement. Some of the unique characteristics are as follows: It is intuitive, 100% compiled graphical programming language used for automating measurement and control systems; it has patented graphical dataflow language and block diagram approach naturally represent the flow of data and intuitively map user interface controls to data; the LabVIEW Express technology transforms common measurement and automation tasks into much higher-level, easy-to-use Virtual Instruments; it has the unique ability to develop once and deploy to a wide variety of computing targets - desktop computers, PDAs, real-time targets, arbitrary 32-bit processors, and more - for maximum flexibility in system design; and it has seamless integration with the NI Volume License Manager, for efficiently managing the LabVIEW user base across a computing network.

It is anticipated that a firm fixed price purchase order, utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, will be awarded for this requirement and the period of performance will include a base period of nine months and two twelve month option periods. No RFQ package is available. Any interested parties may submit in writing, a detailed capability statement to respond to this requirement; however, a determination by the Government to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for quotes. If no affirmative responses are received by April 11, 2007 at 10:00am, the Contracting Officer will proceed with the award to National Instruments Corporation.

BASIS FOR AWARD:  This procurement is being solicited, offered, evaluated, and awarded using simplified acquisition procedures.  The OCC will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible hotel (FAR Subpart 9.104) whose quote will be the most advantageous to the OCC using the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  

1.	Suitability encompasses the factors that contribute to the overall success of the conference and to the conference attendee's convenience, comfort and safety at the hotel.  Evaluation of suitability will be a subjective assessment of the features and services offered by the hotel and of other relevant facts and circumstances that are obtained by OCC from any source.  The suitability assessment will focus on, but not be limited to, the location of the hotel, the condition of the hotel facility (new, old, remodeled); condition of the guest rooms (designated non-smoking rooms; soft goods clean and in good condition, etc.); condition of the meeting rooms (size and shape, obstructions such as pillars, soundproofing, security, proximity of rooms to each other, etc.); hotel services; availability of on-premise outlets, such as restaurants, convenience store and fitness facility; proximity of the Metro to the hotel.  The OCC may base its rating solely on the information provided in the quote or, at OCC’s option, also on the findings gathered during a SITE VISIT.  
 

2.	Past performance is considered to be the hotel’s relevant work history and the OCC's assessment, with respect to such work history, of how well the hotel performed.  Especially relevant are a hotel's record of conforming to contract requirements; a hotel's commitment to customer satisfaction; and, generally, a hotel's reputation for demonstrating a business-like concern for the interests of its customers.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on OCC’s experience, if any, with the hotel; the experience of references submitted by the hotel; and a consideration of other relevant facts and circumstances that are obtained by OCC from any source.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.   

3.	Price.  Price is the total evaluated cost of a quote.  OCC will base total evaluated cost on the prices quoted for guest rooms, meeting rooms, food and beverages, and audio visual equipment.  OCC will not consider prices that are contingent, unreasonable or unbalanced.  OCC will use total evaluated cost as part of its best value analysis.

OCC anticipates awarding the contract in May 2007.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Assets available at DLA      The intent of this purchase is to upgrade the radio trunking System for the Provest Martial Office at Fort Carson, Colorado.  The system is not APCO 25 so only the Motorola XTS5000 radio components will work properly with all features of this network.   Fort Carson has IMRESS chargers and batteries.  At the present there are no batteries certified to work correctly in the chargers.  It is imperative that the requested radios and chargers be Motorola certified to meet the requirements and standards to op erate on the BSTRS radio system. The only alternative is to use non-proprietary components, but the resulting cost of support cannot be justified considering the overall cost of the existing system and support agreements with Motorola. This is a sole source brand name procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.320-1) and (FAR 13.501).  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES, however; any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 4 days from the date of the publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in SUFFICIENT detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requir ements listed above.  Responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.  If no responses are rece ived, the Government will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Legacy Communication, Inc.  Responses are due 12:01:00 PM (MST) 09 April 2007.

<DESC>04-5-2007,  9:07 a.m.
Response to questions submitted for RFP SECHQ1-07-R-0111:
Questions 26-35

Please note:  
(1)  Questions 1 through 5 have been asked and responded to via Amendment 4 on FEDBIZOPS.   Questions 6-17 have been answered via Amendment 5 on FEDBIZOPS. Questions 18-25  were  answered via Amendment 7 on FEDBIZOPS.  These questions are numbered to reflect a continuation of the questions asked and answered for this particular RFP.

(2)  Cut-off date for Questions for this Solicitation is 3:00 p.m. EST, April 5, 2007.

Question 26:  There are parts of the SEC response to questions in amendments 9 and 10 that imply the SEC is still reviewing the request and will respond via amendments to be issued.  See LINE ITEM 0007, question 36.  The due date is April 9 and with pending answers plus the questions herein, we request consideration for an additional delay which will allow adequate time to prepare a response.  

Response:    All previous questions have been answered via amendments to the Solicitation.  The revisions to the RFP have been posted and e-mailed to all that requested the information.  The due date of April 9, 2007 will stand.

Question 27:  Throughout the amendments there appears to be an SEC definition of CFMS relative to commercial practices and that the terms are interchangeable.  For example, the requirement for stating a bidders CFMS commercial revenue.  CFMS is a schedule and definition of the Federal Acquisition Service and really has no definition in the in the commercial marketplace.  As a contract office furniture dealer, what we do commercially every day is what CFMS is all about.

Response:  The SEC is seeking corporate experience in the business that is similar to what is being requested in the SOW.

Question 28:  Please provide additional definition for Section B and the use of, NTE __percentage of CLINs, and how Note 4 applies.  Is the $3,000,000 the fee or is that the planned expense for furniture items?

Response:  $3M is estimated not to exceed the pool of to be funding available for the purchase of furniture for Project No. 2.  The actual amount will be included in future task orders.  The percentage NTE was incorporated at the suggestion of many at the pre-proposal conference that is based on the total amount of furniture purchase funding.

Question 29:  The requirements of the Technical proposal for the furniture portion C.2 is virtually impossible to write since the SEC has provided no information regarding the furniture requirements, i.e. systems versus private office, etc., consequently we cannot see any how to structure a meaningful response.

Response:  This portion of the contract is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract.  We will need office furnishings as stated in the RFP.  We have provided information as to the square foot of each SEC location, and the number of employees that we have in each location.  We?ve chosen this type of contracting vehicle (IDIQ) to respond to office furnishing needs as required.

Question 30:  One of the additional examples of the confusion caused by the use of CFMS terminology is the requirement for CFMS experience for delivery personnel.  Once again, CFMS is just a schedule definition by the Federal Acquisition Service to define specific services relative to contract furniture.

Response:  The SEC is using the labor category descriptions from the GSA schedule that were suggested at the pre-proposal conference.  The SEC?s detailed requirements for CFMS services is explained in the RFP.

Question 31:  In one of the earlier amendments, you were kind enough to list those organizations that had requested the Solicitation.  Is it possible to receive an updated list and also a list of attendees at the pre-bid conference?

Response:  
Interested Contractors

Adelphia Steel Equipment Co. Inc.
All Native Systems
Financial and Realty Services, LLC
H&S Resources Corporation
Heery International, Inc.
Homeland Office Furniture
JIL Information Systems

Omnifics, Inc.

Quality Technical Services, Inc.

Dave Storey, Quality Technical Services, Inc.
Carolyn Simmons, Omnifics
Michael Wolf, Project Solutions Group
Craig Waddy, U.S. Business Interiors
Joyce Dawson, Heery International, Inc.
Paul Harbison, Heery International, Inc.

Question 32:  When asking for corporate experience in Section L it is consistently referred to a, commercial CFMS, rather than just CFMS experience.  Do you only want commercial experience or all CFMS experience that is equivalent to the work being proposed?

Response:  Yes, we would like all CFMS experience that is equivalent to the work being proposed.

Question 33:  How will travel costs be handled after contract award?  Will the individual task orders have a travel CLIN?

Response:    Travel is proposed consistent with the GSA travel regulations and will be funded via individual task orders when needed.

Question 34:  I am still concerned about the limitation on Corporate Experience to only commercial experience.  We were the first CFMS schedule holder for GSA and we have extensive experience of similar size and scope in the federal sector and would like to use this experience in our corporate experience section.  Please clarify if we can use federal CFMS experience.

Response:  Please see question 32.  The response is the same:  we would like all CFMS experience that is equivalent to the work being proposed.

Question 35:  For the newly proposed labor rates with the percentages attached to them, we believe that if we propose a NTE percentage of the previous line item, we may not make but a marginal profit.  For instance, if we order one chair for the UTAH office, and the chair costs $200, we will only make $20 if they use our plan for labor rates.  Are we correct in our understanding of this?

Response:  The revised price breakdown for the CLINs in question,newly pro posed labor rates, was a result of the Q& A section of the proposal conference.  Our response to the pricing of the administrative fee for Project  No. 2 tasks was to provide a cost breakdown that included hourly rates plus a percentage cap for the fee.  It is our understanding that this is industry standard.
