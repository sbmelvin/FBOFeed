<DESC>Introduction:
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for the development of therapeutic agents for select biodefense pathogens.
Description: 
Through this solicitation, the NIAID, is seeking to support projects to advance the development of promising candidate therapeutics with demonstrated in vivo activity against one or more of the following NIAID biodefense priority pathogens: Bacillus anthracis, Variola major, Filoviruses: Marburg and Ebola, Influenza, Gram negative biodefense bacteria.  Note: NIAID seeks to support the development of broad spectrum antimicrobials with activity against more than one NIAID Category A, B, or C priority biodefense Gram negative pathogen, (e.g. Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, B. mallei, Rickettsia prowazeki, Coxiella burnetti, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni). Antimicrobial resistant pathogens were recently added to the NIAID Category C priority biodefense pathogens list and are defined as pathogens, excluding sexually-transmitted organisms (see http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/anti_stis.htm for list of excluded organisms), resistant to antimicrobial agents.  Broad spectrum Gram negative candidate therapeutic agents proposed for advancement under this program should have demonstrated in vivo activity against at least one Gram negative Category A, B, or C pathogen; AND in vitro activity against at least three different genera of Gram negative Category A, B, or C pathogens.

The candidate therapeutic should be at a stage of development that is, at a minimum, within five (5) years of completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial. Support will be provided for non-clinical studies, medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and other Investigational New Drug (IND)-, New Drug Application (NDA)-, or Biologic License Application (BLA)-enabling studies. The NIAID is particularly interested in candidate therapeutics with broad spectrum activity and that are within the regulatory purview of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Contracts awarded under this solicitation will not support: The design and conduct of Phase 3 clinical trials, the development of vaccines (vaccine is defined as an intervention that directly elicits a pathogen specific immune response), and the development of polyclonal antibody blood-derived products.

It is anticipated that one or more cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a five-year period of performance beginning on or about July 31, 2008.  It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately 5 ? 8.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about July 11, 2007, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<SUBJECT>D -- Modification of the Credit Risk Assessment Framework & Support for the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program
<SOLNBR>DTFR53-06-R-00005
<RESPDATE>081806
<CONTACT>Susan  Bechtol, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-493-6154, Fax 202-493-6171, Email susan.bechtol@dot.gov - Desmond Brown, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-493-6152, Fax 202-493-6171, Email desmond.brown@fra.dot.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century established a new program of credit assistance, the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program.  Under this Program, loans and loan guarantees are available to acquire, improve or rehabilitate intermodal or rail equipment or facilities, including track, components of track, bridges, yards, buildings and shops, to refinance existing debt incurred for the previous purposes, and to develop or establish new intermodal or railroad facilities.  Eligible applicants include states, local governments, government sponsored authorities, and corporations, Amtrak and freight railroads.  There is a statutory maximum amount of outstanding unpaid principal at any point in time of $35 billion.  Of this, $7 billion is reserved for projects primarily benefiting shortline and regional railroads.  The Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires that funds be available to cover the subsidy cost before a direct loan or loan guarantee can be approved by any Federal agency under any program.   Generally, these costs are covered by appropriations from Congress.  However, unlike other federal credit programs, the RRIF program’s enabling legislation provides that such subsidy cost can be paid from appropriations, a “credit risk premium” paid by the borrow (CRP) or any combination of the two.  Since the RRIF program has not had any appropriations, all the loans previously approved and all that will be approved in the foreseeable future have required, and will require, the payment of a CRP.  

The calculation of the CRP depends on many factors, including the financial condition of the applicant, the amount of collateral offered to secure the loan and the financial strength of the applicant.  In order to calculate the CRP for each loan application, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has previously developed, through a contractor, a Credit Risk Assessment Framework (CRAF).   The CRAF, which has been approved by OMB, relies on the latest default experience available for corporations in the private sector.  Thus, the CRAF must be updated on a yearly basis.  The CRAF is also used to comply with OMB’s requirement to reestimate subsidy costs for each loan on a yearly basis.    The CRAF model has been used primarily to calculate the credit risk premium of corporate applicants from the private sector.

REQUIREMENT: The purpose of this acquisition is to procure services to maintain the CRAF and modify it as necessary, to assist FRA in generating yearly reestimates of subsidy costs for each outstanding loan in the portfolio, and to provide support for the FRA’s RRIF Program in connection with the CRAF model.
The specific requirements are to (1) annually analyze the historical default experience of at least 1000 companies with credit ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating agencies;  apply various statistical methods, such as logistic regression analysis, to explain differences in the ratings of the 1,000 companies analyzed; update the CRAF based on the results of the analysis of the historical default analysis and FRA’s own default experience for loans in the RRIF portfolio; and calculate reestimates of loans that have been made and provide supporting spreadsheets showing the calculations, and annual summary memorandum explaining the re-estimate methodology;  (2) assure that the CRAF is consistent with the Credit Subsidy Calculator required to be used by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), recommend procedures for calculating subsidy reestimates required by OMB and modify the CRAF to calculate the reestimates,  assure the error-free operation of the updated CRAF; modify the CRAF to run on new versions of Excel as needed,  revise the supporting documentation to explain the modifications and update the User’s Guide to be consistent with the modifications and to incorporate the subsidy reestimates procedures, and  work with RRIF and FRA IT staff to resolve any CRAF technical issues and make any changes to the CRAF model as requested or as necessary; (3)  modify the CRAF to accommodate public sector applicants whose financial qualifications vary significantly from private corporations; explore the possibility of incorporating FRA’s historical default experience into the CRAF default data base to more accurately reflect the default potential for RRIF applicants and provide a recommendation to the FRA, and explore the possibility of converting the CRAF model into a secure, Internet-based application enabling designated users to access the system using a browser, login ID and password and provide a recommendation to the FRA; and (4) Develop and provide training to the FRA on an as needed basis during the life of the contract.  The FRA anticipates that training may be required for up to 10 new and existing FRA staff when significant updates and enhancements are made to the CRAF.  Training shall be provided at the FRA’s site in Washington, D.C.  

The successful offeror shall have a minimum of five (5) years experience in implementing requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.  This includes calculating subsidy estimates and reestimates in accordance with OMB requirements, including the current OMB Credit Subsidy Calculator.  

The FRA intends to award a 5-year firm-fixed-priced contract, consisting of a base year and four 1-year option periods.  This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12.6 – Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solication for Commercial Items, and FAR Part 5.203(a) and (b).  The FRA intends to post the solicitation for this requirement by July 21, 2006 on FedBizOps.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT WILL BE THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement-type contract for the effort described herein.  This acquisition is set-aside 100% for small business.  The small business must qualify under NAICS Code 541990, "All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services," with the SBA's size standard of $6.5 million in annual receipts.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The Minerals Management Service intends to competitively award a contract for an approximate 18 month study to assist the MMS in developing information for the North and Mid-Atlantic regions in support of planning, decision-making, and environmental assessment related to the management of petroleum and alternative energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  It is expected that this study will (1) identify and locate existing onshore infrastructure that would potentially support OCS energy projects in the North and Mid-Atlantic regions; (2) collect a standard data set for each identified infrastructure facility that includes such information as location, construction date, capacity, and selected physical characteristics; (3)  develop, for each infrastructure type, a description of a typical facility that discusses issues of its physical characteristics (e.g., space used, environmental outputs), location (e.g., required physical inputs such as access), construction requirements (e.g., labor), and operational requirements (e.g., labor); and, (4)  develop, for each infrastructure type, a description of industry characteristics, survey of important regulations governing facility operations, Federal and State, and analyze historical data to identify past trends and possible future trends in the construction, use and retirement of facilities.  The study will focus on the onshore areas where existing infrastructure is likely to support both traditional and alternative energy development on the OCS in the North and Mid-Atlantic regions and where any new support infrastructure is likely to be built.  Generally, focus includes coastal areas of states from Maine through Virginia.  However, the geographical reach of support infrastructure varies by type.  The tasks include literature review of existing Gulf of Mexico Infrastructure Fact Book and MMS sponsored updates; Site Identification; Data Collection; Data Analysis and Development of a Fact Book.  HOW TO RESPOND:  For a full copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP), please contact Debra Bridge via email [debra.bridge@mms.gov].  Please include in your request the RFP No. M07RP13322 and title "Energy Related Infrastructure," your organization's name, point of contact, Dunn & Bradstreet number, address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address.  Requests must be made no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Wednesday, July 25, 2007.

Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.

Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:   •	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D. •	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof 	of insurance. •	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the 	prime contractor including contract number and term). •	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year 	covering the previous two years.

Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshal’s Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.

Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee: 	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List. 	b.    is illegally present in the United States. c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant. d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information. 	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations. 7.

Offerors shall submit past performance and experience information. The offeror must provide the information requested for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offeror’s submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offeror’s.  Past performance information shall demonstrates how well the Offeror satisfied its customers on previous contracts and shall  include name(s) for points of contact, telephone numbers, email address, contract number (if !  any), contract price, period of performance, years performed and any unique qualities of the contract.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Dowty Propellers-Americas, 114 Powers Court, Sterling, VA, 20166 for two (2) each Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Control Module Bench Testers, Part Number DE4180.  This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  Dowty Propellers  developed the control module bench tester to provide a troubleshooting capability for the LCAC.  This Control Module Bench Tester allows the ACU personnel to test a suspect control module prior to supply system turn-in to confirm the operability or inoperability of the module. The LCAC propeller system is a proprietary design, owned solely by Dowty Propellers.  No other manufacturers are permitted to develop components for the LCAC propeller system other than those identified by Dowty. The Control Module Bench Tester must interface with the electronic control boxes that operate the prop!  eller pitch system of LCAC.  This requires proprietary control software that is owned by Dowty. As the sole developer of this tester, Dowty Propellers is uniquely qualified to provide these items.  Award will be based on the written proposal. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity-Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. Anticipated award date will be on or about July 16, 2007.  NAICS Code 334515 applies. PSC is 6625. SBA Size Standard is 500 Employees.

<DESC>This is a source of sought announcement for written information only.  This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted.  In preparation for a future procurement, The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), Port Hueneme, CA is performing a ?market research? to determine potential firms that can demonstrate technology, equipment and software related to inspection of seafloor cables using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV?s). Underwater inspections provide valuable information in assessing cable condition and planning for cable maintenance or repair operations.  The ultimate program objective is to provide the Navy with a capability to use AUV?s to inspect underwater range cables which are laid ?proud? (exposed) on the seafloor. Seafloor types include sediment, gravel and rocky.   Locations for these cables are generally known within a radius of a few hundred yards and their heading is generally known within 20 degrees. Cables of interest may be 5 to 40 km (3 to 25 miles) long in water depths from 25 to 5,000 meter (80 to 16,500 ft).  Range cables are ?small cables? defined as approximately 1.6 to 3.2 cm (5/8 to 1 ? inch) diameter with internal steel strength member?s equivalent to a 0.6 cm (?-inch) diameter steel cable. The cables are typically covered with either a black or white colored polyethylene jacket or occasionally in shallow water with a black ?jute? wrapping.  AUV?s are potentially attractive platforms for cable following and inspection operations.  AUV?s can significantly reduce cable inspection costs by reducing the high costs associated with leasing and operating an ROV or manned submersible and support vessel.  The critical technology that is currently considered ?missing? for conducting an AUV cable inspection is the sensors, and the associated cable acquisition/following algorithms used to detect, identify and follow the ?small? cable.  Integration and operation of the equipment on an AUV is not a part of this phase of the demonstration, nor is it the intent of this effort to develop new sensors or AUV?s. Currently available AUV?s have suites of guidance and navigation software/hardware and are capable of hosting detection systems and fusing together guidance data from various sensors.  NFESC is interested in funding a demonstration(s) to establish the feasibility of using AUV?s (autonomously and using passive - non tone applied techniques) to locate, and follow small seafloor range cables laying ?proud? on the surface of the seafloor.  The intent of this effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of equipment (sensors) and methods (software) to autonomously detect and follow the cable. It is not the intent of this effort to demonstrate the performance of an AUV platform.  Thus, the demonstration might be accomplished by conducting a field test using a laboratory platform, ROV or AUV, or by other convenient laboratory demonstration or data simulation.  Demonstrations should as a minimum include all necessary software and hardware to autonomously accomplish the following:  Find and acquire a small diameter cable laying ?proud? on the seafloor given the general location (within a few hundred meters) and heading (within 20 degrees) of the cable; and specific cable properties (cable specifications) cited above.  Follow the cable, including determining the direction to follow the cable.   Resolve issues along route:  Reacquire the cable after losing the cable in short runs of sediment cover - Resolve issues related to crossing cables.  Notes:  (1) Techniques that allow for following a buried cable are not a part of this effort but are of potential future interest (2) Following must be accomplished in a manner that will allow the AUV to photo or video document the entire length of the cable.  Organizations that have all or some of these capabilities are invited to submit information on their related experience, technology available and proposed approach to demonstrate meeting the requirements.  A summary, citing related work demonstrating relevant experience should be included.  Responses to this announcement can include both off-the-shelf and developmental approaches.  Responses should include a technical description with characteristics of the proposed technology including for example:  the recommended demonstration approach; detection algorithms; sensors and expected detection resolution.   There should be sufficient detail to allow the government to determine the development state and suitability of the technology to meet the requirements and the value of a funded demonstration.  Organizations responding to this Sources Sought announcement should not include proprietary information in their responses.  Any responses that include information marked as proprietary will be returned unread.  Responses to this announcement will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives.  This announcement is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The government will assess the technology described in the submittals for potential application to AUV underwater cable following and inspection. Firms with technology assessed to provide significant value and potential for AUV underwater cable following and inspection may be provided an opportunity to demonstrate their technology.  Discuss the requirement and your firms, ability to provide the requested procurement.  The applicable NAICS code is 541330 with a size limitation standard of $20M.   Interested sources must submit any comments and information by via email to Hugh.Thomas@navy.mil and Richard.Camacho@navy.mil no later than 26 July 2007.  Responses received after this deadline may not be considered.  Since this is a sources of sought announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Program Executive Office Intelligence and Information Systems (PEO-IIS), located at MacDill Air Force Base, FL, is looking for companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide Commercial off the Shelf (COTS), Non-Developmental Items (NDI), or near NDI component technologies that can provide multiple levels of server hardware and software.

USSOCOM is interested in receiving information from vendors who are currently using the most advanced technologies in the design and fabrication of these component items.  

The Government may acquire for testing purposes one or more vendor products.

The vendor must be able to address how their solution will enhance USSOCOM ability to deploy a two node distributed data center (DDC).  This solution or group of solutions must provide capabilities such as Level 2 caching, hyperthreading of processes, resource redundancy and high availability, hardware configuration flexibility, remote management capabilities (both in-band and out-band), scalability (both vertical and horizontal), as well as provide processor speeds capable of handling high volume processing in an efficient manner.  The vendor must identify the form factor of their proposed solution, as well as power requirements and dissipation, cooling enhancements, security features, and should group server products into blade, entry level (1-2 processors/2-4-8 core); mid-level (2-4 processors/4-16 core); high-end (4+ processors/8+ core).  The vendor should also identify the number and types of management tools offered with their solution, as well as the complexity of the tools, any predictive diagnostic capabilities that can alert a management system, and identify whether the servers are engineered by the vendor or if components are integrated.  

The vendor should identify any cost advantages of their solution over that of another vendor, provide a price versus performance ratio, and identify any vendor relationships with Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and System Integrators (SIs).  Additionally, the vendor should identify any enhancements or capabilities that would distinguish them from another vendor, such as: direct attached storage enhancements, networking cards, memory enhancements, processor enhancements, virtualization advantages, and any supplementary capabilities worth noting, as well as keep customer aware of any new or emerging technologies of which they may not be aware.  Furthermore, the vendor must identify the following post-sale support information:  detailed warranty information, training provided (how many users, type of training), level of support, service level agreement for the stated level of support, and how many cleared personnel will be available to support their solution or group of solutions.

Proposed Solutions:  entry-level, mid range, and high-end servers.

Items to be addressed by vendor: 

1.	How will vendor server solutions enhance USSOCOM ability to deploy a two node distributed data center (DDC)?
2.	Cost advantages
3.	Hardware configuration flexibility (i.e. hot swapping, scaling vertically)
4.	New emerging technologies that a customer may or may not be aware of
5.	Number and type of management tools
6.	Predictive diagnostics that alert a management system
7.	Direct Attached Storage enhancements that distinguishes themselves from competitors
8.	Networking cards and other capabilities that distinguishes themselves from competitors
9.	Memory enhancements that distinguishes themselves from competitors
10.	Processor enhancements that distinguishes themselves from competitors
11.	Resource redundancy and high availability
12.	Vendor relationships with Independent Software Vendors (ISV) and System Integrators (SI)s
13.	Group server products into entry level (1-2 processors/2-4-8 core); mid-level (2-4 processors/4-16 core); high-end (4+ processors/8+ core)
14.	Form factor
15.	Type  number of Expansion Slots
16.	System I/O port configuration (type and number)
17.	Hard drive number, type, size and available configurations 
18.	Power requirements and dissipation
19.	Cooling enhancements
20.	Are the servers engineered by the vendor or are the components integrated
21.	Warranties
22.	Remote Management capabilities

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Contractor shall work with TARDECs own unique special based computer Onyx4 system. The Contractor shall continue its refinements of specialized advanced processes to the Onyx4 system to ascertain CTIS images i n real time processing. The Contractors algorithm reconstruction development shall enable visualization of larger more complex data sets with a higher rate of interactivity to improve productivity.  The Contractors research shall further define how to optimize this computational analysis, and the optical hardware layout, to determine changes to the current reconstruction algorithms that shall result in speedup and accuracy. This meets objectives for continued improvements in real time, to identify and e liminate design and performance issues prior to manufacturing the item.  See Numbered Notes: 22 & 26

<DESC>A critical success factor in FRA’s Human Capital Implementation Plan is developing and enhancing managerial/executive leadership skills.  Executive coaching is one tool to enhance a manager’s effectiveness by affecting a shift in the manager’s knowledge and behavior, using a structured process.

FRA has approximately 800 employees spread throughout the United States, of which, 75 are managers and executives.  To better prepare the managers and executives, FRA encourages these managers to pursue coaching.  Managers/executives range from 1st line supervisors over small organizations to executives overseeing large organizations.  However, only new supervisors are required to take coaching within 12 months of assuming a supervisory position.

The number of FRA managers who will be seeking coaches each year may range between 5-15.  FRA anticipates awarding more than one IDIQ contract with no guaranteed minimum.  The period of performance for this requirement is one base year and 4 one-year options.  The solicitation will be issued electronically using FedBizOpps on June 09, 2006.  No written copy will be available.

<CONTACT>Loni Chinn, (202) 385-8571
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source purchase order to lease a Pulsed Doppler Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) for Operational Evaluation for four months at Las Vegas (LAS) McCarran International Airport. Purpose of Announcement:  In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System Policy 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.   This specific requirement is to support the Office of Terminal Weather's mission to perform an operational evaluation and test of the performance of LIDAR at (LAS) McCarran International Airport.  The need for this requirement is to improve wind shear detection at LAS.  The Terminal Doppler Weather Radar does not provide good dry microburst detection, and the test and evaluation will determine if the LIDAR is the solution to complement the TDWR at airports in dry climate locations.  Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies' Wind Tracer is the LIDAR consisting of environmental equipment shelter, transceiver and electronics, scanner, signal processing system, air conditioner/heater, UPS Backup, system control and monitoring. The Wind Tracer is capable of providing air traffic with wind shear detection alerts in the format established by other FAA wind shear systems. The lease also will include site survey, logistics, planning, and installation, two graphic situational displays and full service maintenance. A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement because of the time constraints associated with the completion of this effort. It is in the best interest of the FAA to procure a four month lease agreement as a single source to Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies in order to meet the time constraints of the operational evaluation and test.  If your firm believes it can fulfill the requirement, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the services outlined above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Loni Chinn, Contracting Officer by 10:00 A.M. EDT, July 6, 2007.

<DESC>The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), Library Services and Content Management (LSCM), Library Technical Information Services (LTIS) seeks to acquire bibliographic metadata transcription services for ca. 600,000 3 x 5 catalog cards in its 1,000,000 card historic shelflist collection.   These cards contain brief bibliographic metadata captured as part of the cataloging activity for the Cataloging and Indexing (C&I) Program and the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) from ca. 1870s until the shelflist officially closed in October 1992.  GPO?s goal is to convert the bibliographic data on these cards into machine-readable records in MARC21 format so that they can be loaded to GPO?s Integrated Library System (ILS) (Aleph 500) catalog.  

LSCM manages the National Bibliography of U.S. Government Publications formerly known as the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP). The unit catalogs in all formats published by all three branches of the U.S. Government in accordance with 44, U.S.C., Section 1710-1711.  Documents in the National Bibliography are available through the online CGP (http://catalog.gpo.gov).

2.	   Approach

The successful offeror will be directed by GPO to perform the work in a phased approach, as laid out in this RFP, although later phases may not be required, depending on the priorities set by the GPO.   Each phase will be completed over four option years after the initial phase is completed in the first year.  Offerors will provide a plan for one year?s worth of work on the bibliographic metadata transcription process not to exceed $100,000. Offerors should also provide a proposal for the four option years.  

The successful offeror will be required to transcribe a test batch of approximately 200 cards into MARC 21 records for evaluation before work begins on the project in full.  The evaluation of the test batch will help determine the best and most efficient workflow approach, and allow GPO to validate the metadata transcription requirements outlined in this RFP. 

Interested vendors should contact the contracting officer, Mrs. Albertha Broadnax on 202-512-0966, 202-512-1354 (fax) or at abroadnax@gpo.gov.

The purpose of this strategy is to include all bonded structures stock numbers so that administrative lead time may be minimized.  All stock numbers that apply to this strategy are listed on the attachment.  Delivery will be established for each line item on applicable delivery orders when competition is conducted.

MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:    1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees.  2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:   •	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D. •	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof 	of insurance. •	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the 	prime contractor including contract number and term). •	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year 	covering the previous two years.

NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at Government expense. Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshal’s Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.

Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.   6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee: 	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List. 	b.    is illegally present in the United States. c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant. d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information. 	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations. 7.

Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel. 9.

Offerors shall submit past performance and experience information. The offeror must provide the information requested for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offeror’s submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offeror’s.  Past performance information shall demonstrates how well the Offeror satisfied its customers on previous contracts and shall  include name(s) for points of contact, telephone numbers, email address, contract number (if !  any), contract price, period of performance, years performed and any unique qualities of the contract.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide Questions and Answers. 1.  Question: You have requested a mixture of solid and clear panels for the KO and SGE workstations.  Please advise what type of mixture you would like.  Do these supervisors need to see the workstations outside their offices or are you just looking for light transfer (instead of being able to see out, having glass above head height to allow for light to flow through)? Answer: Supervisors need to see some of their workspace area and folks need to see them if they are talking with someone. 2.  Question: For item 2, do you want this separation wall to be all fabric or part glass?  If glass, how much glass do you want? Answer:  Not sure on the glass, I thought the product lines have a Plexiglas plastic? 3.  Question: The completion date of August 24 will be fairly tight.  Is this date set in stone?  Most manufacturers have a 4 week lead time and then the shipping from the US will take between 2-3 weeks.  Answer: There maybe some time flexibility depending on client layout acceptance.  If you are the award vender, then please plan to meet and move quickly on this order.

This software is required to load the software on two servers located in one of EPA’s Offices.  LEI is the program used to transfer data between its Oracle and Lotus Notes databases and is necessitated by the security requirements of the Office’s applications.  The Office is currently using an older LEI version which works with the Agency’s current version of Lotus Notes, however, EPA will soon be upgrading its Lotus Notes application to Version 7 and therefore the Office needs to upgrade to LEI software Version 7.0.2., 1, EA;<BR>LI 002, License and Maintenance Agreements for 400 "Value Units."  The Environmental Protection Agency requires license and maintenance agreements for 400 “Value Units.”  Since the Office will be installing LEI on two (2) servers and each server has two (2) single-core processors, the Office needs to purchase 400 “Value Units” for the licenses and maintenance.  The Office has computed the number of “Value Units” as follows:   2 (servers) x 2 (processors/server) x 1 (core/processor) x 100 (value units/core) = 400 value units. , 1, EA; <BR><BR>For this solicitation, Environmental Protection Agency intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE - This is a Sources Sought Notice; there is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for solicitation will receive no response.  The purpose of publishing a Sources Sought Notice is strictly for market research, all information gathered will be used to identify potential sources meeting the objective. 

OBJECTIVE:  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MLBT) is currently researching potential sources capable of providing a tribometer to support its Advanced Coatings Technology and Survivability program.  The equipment will be used to test both liquid and solid lubricants.  Requirements of the tribometer are as stated below: 

The tribometer and its associated testing process (methods of test) involve
the controlled manipulation of a ball-on-disc contact (of a particular
aircraft-quality steel or other material) in such a way that
rolling/sliding/skew is introduced into the contact in order to simulate
gear contact with another gear, or bearing contact with its raceway.  The
process has multiple capabilities to change the rolling (or entraining) and
sliding velocities independently, in infinite ratios to simulate lubricant
performance under any condition. The type of testing AFRL/MLBT needs to conduct is dependant on the following parameters:

Motor speed for the ball must be controllable from 0 to 16,000 RPM, and motor speed for the corresponding disc must also be controllable from 0-8,000 RPM. Changing the ball and disc speeds allows customization of the test.  Different lubrication applications require different speeds at the contact point. 

The base temperature range of the instrument must be 25 degrees C to 350 degrees C, but must have the ability to be fitted with a cryogenic chamber which would mean operating temperatures as low as -200 degrees C.  Also, there should be a high temperature package available to increase the temperature range to 800 degrees C. 

The maximum load needed is 1000N with ball tilt angles of +/- 22.5 degrees.  The test chamber must have the ability to be humidity controlled with at least <10% relative humidity in the test environment.  Lubricants that must perform in high load environments must be tested at high loads.  Perfluorinated lubricants are notorious for testing differently in humid environments versus dry environments. Humidity control is crucial to test repeatability for perfluorinated lubricants. 

Training and software to run the tribometer should also be included. 

Both small and large businesses capable of delivering the required tribometer are encouraged to respond to this notice.  

No special format or form is required for information; however, all responding sources must indicate their 1) legal business name, 2) CAGE code, 3) size standard size status in relation to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, and 4) information showing capability to provide tribometer meeting the requirements stated above.

**For questions regarding this Sources Sought Notice, please call Mr. Jeff Jacob at 937 522-4646.  All respondent information can be e-mailed to jeffrey.jacob@wpafb.af.mil or faxed to 937 656-1412 Attn: Jeff Jacob with subject line RE: TRIBOMETER - Sources Sought Notice.**

ALL INFORMATION IS DUE BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS 09 JULY 2007.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SURVEY


Market Research Survey


Introduction:   The Federal Bureau of Prisons is commencing the preliminary planning analysis of Legal Instrument Examiners services performed in Grand Prairie, TX.  The preliminary planning process is being performed in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular Number A-76 (Revised May 29, 2003) Performance of Commercial Activities. 


Market research is being conducted as part of the preliminary planning phase (prior to formal public announcement) in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.  The purpose of the market research is to validate the scope and grouping of functions, determine the appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, and confirm whether potential sources are available to satisfy agency requirements allowing standard public-private competition.  Small business sources will be considered in this research.  A contract may or may not result depending on the outcome of the market research and any subsequent public-private competition.  


The purpose of conducting a public-private competition is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method for providing the services required.  If conducted, a public-private competition will determine whether the services will be performed under contract from commercial sources or continue to be provided by a Most Efficient Organization (MEO) of the federal workforce.  The Government contemplates the issuance of a solicitation for all or part of the service requirements defined below. 


Research Method.  A questionnaire has been specifically designed to focus on the scope of requirements of this competition.  A separate questionnaire form will be used to record market information obtained from each commercial source included in the research.


NOTE:  This is to advise any commercial source that provides information as part of this market research process that any information provided will be protected.  This information is being collected solely to assist the government in making the determination whether or not to proceed to competition, and if so, how the functions in question would be grouped for solicitation.  Information obtained will not be used later as part of the evaluation process should they choose to submit a proposal to any solicitation that may result.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below. 

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to serve as the NIDDK Genetics Repository. The repository shall allow the continued storage, maintenance, and quality control, and equitable, ethical distribution of DNA and other resources important to the study of diseases under the mandate of the NIDDK. It facilitates sharing of resources, thus encouraging work by a broad group of investigators and, perhaps, increasing the sample size and the resulting power of a study to identify the genetic determinants of a disease. It helps to ensure that research participants will be making a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.

The objective of this acquisition will be to continue the NIDDK Genetics Repository, in order to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:

?	Receive blood samples from NIDK funded grants and contracts
?	Process these data and materials to create cell lines, cryopreserved lymphocytes, and/or DNA or RNA samples
?	Receive externally produced immortalized lymphocyte cell lines; and
?	Widely distribute all materials to qualified investigators in the scientific community in variety of customized formats

The cell immortalization and other tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience and expertise.  The success rate for cell immortalization is extremely variable.  It depends, in large measure, on how well the established methods are implemented.  As the entire value of many genetics studies rests on the ability to analyze the DNA of sib-pairs and other relatives, inability to recover DNA from any particular sample may negate the value of multiple samples.  Therefore, it is essential that the success rate for establishing cell lines be as close to 100% as possible.  Furthermore, the ability to track thousands of genetic samples, preventing sample mix-ups and cross-contamination while maintaining a high-throughput processing system, is crucial to the integrity of the studies being supported.  The Contractor?s project director must have extensive experience in successfully providing these genetics and sample processing services, including blood cell immortalization and DNA extraction and distribution, to a large group of investigators.  The Contractor?s staff must be highly trained to carry out exacting technical tasks accurately and reproducibly.  As all the work is with samples from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical and safety issues involved in handling human biosamples.  Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract.
 
Currently all of the required work is in the final year of a NIDDK 5-year funded contract with the Rutgers University Cell & DNA Repository.

All qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses interested in submitting a corporate capability statement should demonstrate experience and knowledge for performing the following tasks:

1)	Establish biospecimen preparation, shipping, receipt, and tracking systems for numerous individual multi-center clinical studies;

2)	Maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from samples;

3)	Establish one or more subcontracts for timely and cost-effective shipping of biosamples between multiple sites and the repository;

4)	Create and store viable cell lines via Epstein-Barr virus transformation of lymphocytes from blood samples, with a success rate of 97% or greater and expanding the lymphoblastoid cell lines;

5)	Receive and store lymphoblastoid cell lines prepared at other facilities and carry out quality control assessments;

6)	Cryopreserve blood cells for eventual transformation and/or DNA extraction;

7)	Extract and store DNA from cell lines or from isolated blood cells and, with designated samples, separating the white blood cells (buffy coat) from the plasma;

8)	Receive externally produced DNA;

9)	Carry out whole genome amplification, pedigree analyses and RNA extraction;

10)	 Distribute cell lines and biosamples to investigators granted access by the PO, including arraying in a variety of formats, packaging, handling, and coordinating sample shipments to domestic and international sites;

11)	Withdraw and destroy samples from the repository as directed in writing by the Project Officer;

12)	 Establish and maintain Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) programs;

13)	 Provide security and back-up systems and a plan for disaster recovery;

14)	 Maintain high quality, secure information systems to allow detailed tracking and reporting of sample receipt, processing, storage and distribution, rapid retrieval of samples, storage of QA/QC information associated with the sample, seamless interaction with the Database Repository, and listing of investigators using the repository; and

15)	 Work in a cooperative fashion with the Project Officer, the External Advisory Committee, and the Steering Committee.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to serve as the NIDDK Biosample Repository. The repository stores and maintains biosamples under high quality conditions, and distributes them in an equitable and ethical manner.  This facilitates sharing of NIDDK-supported resources, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations, without excluding those who are established in their fields.  It helps to ensure that research participants make a maximal contribution, and decreases duplicative sampling efforts.
 
The objective of this acquisition will be to continue the NIDDK Biosample Repository, in order to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner: 

?	Receive and store biosamples collected in many different studies, 
?	Carry out specified sample processing and analyses, and
?	Widely distribute biosamples to qualified investigators

The specimen archiving tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment.  The samples were collected over several years from carefully chosen subjects and are present in a finite quantity.  Each sample is unique and cannot be replaced if lost, damaged, or contaminated.  Therefore, it is essential that the samples be stored under optimal conditions, which vary from sample type to sample type.  The Contractor?s project director must have extensive experience in successful management of an archival storage facility that stores various types of biosamples, including blood, stool, urine, DNA, and tissue, and distributes aliquots to many different investigators.  The Contractor?s staff must be highly trained to carry out technical tasks accurately and reproducibly.  As all the work is with samples from human subjects, all staff must be familiar with human subjects protections and be sensitive to the bioethical and safety issues involved in handling human biosamples.  Finally, the Contractor must have a demonstrable long-term interest in providing these services, to ensure that there is continuity throughout the period of the contract, and to prevent repeated shipment of samples from storage site to storage site, as shipment can sometimes damage these unique materials.

NUMBER OF STUDIES
This project will potentially serve fifteen or more large multi-site NIDDK funded studies. 

The range for existing samples is 200,000 to 400,000 individual vials. In addition, to 20,000 to 60,000 new samples, in multiple aliquots (5 ? 20 vials), will be received annually.
 
Currently all of the required work is in the final year of a NIDDK 5-year funded contract with the Fisher Bioservices.

All qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses interested in submitting a corporate capability statement should demonstrate experience and knowledge for performing the following tasks:

1)	Establish biospecimen preparation, shipping, receipt, and tracking systems for numerous individual multi-center clinical studies;

2)	Maintain the confidentiality of subjects by removing all traditional personal identifiers from samples;

3)	Establish one or more subcontracts for shipping of biosamples between multiple sites and the repository and for timely and cost-effective laboratory processing and/or testing of biosamples;

4)	Store biosamples under optimal conditions to minimize loss, damage or contamination;

5)	Distribute biosamples to qualified investigators granted access by the Project Officer, including packaging, handling, and coordinating sample shipments to domestic and international sites;

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to serve as the NIDDK Data Repository. The Data Repository stores the data from large clinical studies, including data associated with the stored biosamples and acts as the Data Coordinating Center for the NIDDK Central Repositories.  The Database Repository, acting as a central coordinating entity, facilitates efficient distribution of data and samples.  As an archive and distributor of highly usable legacy datasets, the Repository also allows re-analysis of these data and, where relevant, of specific biosamples, thus encouraging work by junior investigators, investigators with novel approaches, and others not included in current collaborations.

The objective of this acquisition shall be to continue the NIDDK Data Repository, in order to accomplish the following in a highly efficient, rapid, and cost-effective manner:

?	Assist study coordinating centers and the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repository in setting up labeling systems to cross-reference samples and associated data
?	Maintain a central inventory of samples from the NIDDK Biosample and Genetics Repositories, and provide inventory reporting structures for individual studies
?	Receive and test the validity of electronic databases from completed studies
?	Maintain and distribute those databases, including administering review of access applications
?	Provide timely and informative analyses of databases in response to researcher inquiries
?	Create and maintain a website for all of the NIDDK Central Repositories
?	Carry out activities to advertise to the research community about the availability of samples and data

The information systems, consulting, and database archiving tasks outlined in this statement of work are highly technical, and require extensive experience, expertise, and long-term commitment.  The data from each study represent the efforts of hundreds of investigators over five or more years to improve the public health through biomedical research, and the voluntary participation of hundreds or thousands of patients and family members.

Are there specific actions that you would suggest? The ATF would like to select a contractor and begin leasing airplanes within a relatively short period of time. Please comment on the amount of notice your company would require to begin providing the 5 airplanes. Atten: Jim Huff  james.huff@atf.gov mailto:james.huff@atf.gov.

<DESC>The US Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command intends to procure Pasternack Test Equipment. It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price Contract will be awarded on a sole source basis to Pasternack Enterprises, Inc. 1851 Ketterin g, Irvine, CA 92614-5617, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i) Only One Responsible Source.  CERDECs Software Defined Radio (SDR) capabilities require a suite of test equipment and supporting accessories that has the capability to support programs like the Radio Enabling Technologies, Nextgen Applications (RETNA) Software Defined Radio Defense Te chnology Objective (DTO). CERDECs JTRS Army Center of Excellence Laboratory also requires extensive radio frequency test capabilities to support its role in testing future JTRS Ground Mobile Radio (GMR) waveforms in support of the JTRS Joint Program Execu tive Office (JPEO).  The Ground Mobile Radio branch development and test efforts into Software Defined Radios, RETNA amplifier, and tactical radio system require extensive testing of both hardware and software of radio systems. Testing often requires implementing a radio netwo rk with several radios operating together in a network. To accomplish a multi-radio network in a laboratory environment requires a vast amount of cables, attenuators, terminators, cable adapters, and power dividers. The following cables will assist in the laboratory setup of radios and test equipment. Cables PE3062-12, PE3062-24, PE3062-36, PE3062-48, PE3062-60, PE3062-72, PE3062-120, PE3062-180, PE3062-300, PE3062-600 will allow radios and test equipment to be interc onnected. Various lengths were selected to maximize flexibility in setting up several laboratory arrangements. To assist in interconnection an assortment of adapters are needed to add to the versatility of the cables. Adapter PE9086 Type N elbow allows for  hardwires of test equipment and will eliminate noise. Other adapters such as PE9006, PE9007, PE6016, PE9383, and PE9002 will simply augment the cables listed above and allow for extensions if necessary.  To facilitate the interconnection of radios the following attenuators are necessary to adequately protect test equipment and other radios from inadvertent high power transmissions. The attenuators selected are all 30 dB with Type N connecters and are liste d as, 25 Watt PE7017-030, 50 Watt PE7019-030, 100 Watt PE7021-030, and finally 300 Watt PE7031-030. The higher rated attenuators such as PE7031-030 will allow complete performance testing of radio power amplifier performance as several radio power amplifie rs produce over 20 watts of power and others produce over 100 watts of power. Power dividers will also be needed to perform the combination or interconnection of radios and test equipment. The PE2046 8 Way power divider and PE2045 4 way power divider will accomplish the cable interconnections necessary. Terminators will be needed to properly isolate a radio and test its operation without affecting any other radio or piece of test equipment. Attenuators PE6009 and PE6032 will accomplish this goal for low power radios while PE6042 and PE6106 will provide fo r high power radio scenarios. This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for proposal. However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Solicitation Number W15P7T-07-R-P451 is assigned for r eference purposes. The U.S. Army C-E LCMC has established the IBOP website as part of the Army's Single Face to Industry, to allow electronic posting of Solicitation for Request for Proposals (RFP) Request for Quotations (RFQ) and Invitation for Bids (IFB)  from C-E LCMC to Industry.

<SUBJECT>B -- Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness Analysis
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award on a sole source basis a Purchase Order to Isis Pharmaceuticals ? Ibis Division, Carlsbad, California.  The purpose of this procurement is to obtain a technical protocol and detailed molecular data using a Universal Biosensor that will assist us in developing a hypothesis about the cause of Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI).  The technical protocol to be developed under this procurement will permit production of molecular signatures of all of the microorganisms present in appropriate tick and human samples.  The data to be procured will be the molecular signatures found in ticks and in patients with STARI that are obtained from samples that CDC will provide.   Isis Pharmaceuticals ? Ibis Division has the only instrument and technical approach capable of producing molecular signatures from genetic material of novel (unrecognized, unknown) agents and map them to their closest known relatives.  No one else has developed a method to identify which of the 1,400 potential pathogens are present in a sample without culturing or using a specific organism test.  No other systems can identify any infectious organism without prior knowledge or assumption about what is present. By virtue, Isis Pharmaceuticals ? Ibis Division is uniquely qualified and capable of carrying out the requirement of this proposed purchase order.  The anticipated award date is July 10, 2007.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe they can provide this requirement are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification, as well as, a capability statement to the contracting office by 12:00 p.m. eastern standard time July 10, 2007.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed actions based on responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries may be sent to the attention of Pamela Bolling by e-mail at pbolling@cdc.gov or by fax 770-488-2670.

<SUBJECT>B -- ADVISORY COMMITTEE
<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Headquarters Directorate of Technology has a requirement for a standing committee of prominent scientists, engineers and government officials to provide investigative and advisory services on a wide range of cutting edge science and technologies with the potential to enhance the ability of the command?s operations.  The intended source is the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), a private, non-profit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology. Under the authority of its charter granted by Congress in 1863 and Executive Order 12832 (January 19, 1993), the Academy mandate is to advise federal government on scientific and technical matters. This requirement establishes an advisory committee to support USSOCOM technology development similar to those already established for the Departments of the Air Force, Army and Navy. The standing committee shall investigate but not be limited to such activities as determining the technical merit of current USSOCOM efforts relative to state-of-the-art technologies; evaluating efficiency and effectiveness  in which current efforts are carried out and their impact on the mission; judging relevancy of current technologies to the USSOCOM mission; and analyzing the effective and efficient application of command resources to meet mission needs. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Citation 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the Academy is the only source that can satisfy the agency needs. USSOCOM will rely on the experience and the unique attributes of the National Academy of Sciences to bring together state of the art technical expertise in advanced scientific, engineering and technical disciplines with application to special operation forces.  The standing committee will meet approximately four times annually to identify potential avenues for research and development, product demonstration and practical operational implementation of advanced science and technology.  Committee discussions may form the basis for development and coordination of additional National Research Council (NRC) activities, such as ad hoc studies, workshops or other activities responsive to the USSOCOM mission that draw on the expertise of all applicable units of the National Academies. The Air Force Studies Board, the Naval Studies Board, and the Board on Army Science and Technology (BAST), established by the NRC, have been providing this exact capability for the Military Departments with great success for over two decades.  This experience and expertise with DOD agencies uniquely qualifies the NRC to provide this service for USSOCOM.  The period of performance will be one year, with options for two additional years. NAICS code 541990. See Note 22.

<SUBJECT>59 -- RUGGED EMBEDDED NATIONAL TACTICAL RECEIVER
<DESC>United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to Raytheon Network Centric Systems, Integrated Communications Systems, 1010 Production Road, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46808-4106 for the production of the Rugged Embedded National Tactical Receiver (ENTR) Device (RED).  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334290 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  This is a follow-on sole source contract to Raytheon, whose research and development is at a stage of maturity that will allow for implementation and integration in a timeframe that will satisfy user requirements necessary to immediately deploy this highly specialized technology to the field.  Raytheon is the original developer of the RED hardware and software that is required to satisfy this procurement action, which includes some proprietary hardware.  This action will result in a new contract award for the production of up-to 310 RED units.  

Authority:  This procurement action is being pursued based on the authority provided at Title 10 US Code 2304(a)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).    Raytheon is the only known source that can produce the RED 1) in the total number of units required, 2) in the timeframe required, and 3) can produce a unit at the required level of technology that will fully satisfy user needs. 

Description:   The RED technology produced by Raytheon fills a current gap in mission capability by replacing obsolete and aging legacy Multi-mission Advanced Tactical Terminal (MATT) and Briefcase MATT (BMATT) Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) receiver systems.  The requirement for RED is based on the MATT Joint Operational Requirements Document (JORD) and other USSOCOM host systems/platforms requiring IBS data, including Joint Threat Warning System, MK V Special Operations Craft, and Common Avionics Architecture for Penetration Enhanced Situational Awareness, and Tactical Local Area Network.

To date, the Department maintains over 220 million dollars worth of radio communications equipment worldwide. To maintain this equipment, a procurement vehicle has been in place to cover the need to purchase parts and life cycle replacement radios.     	This procurement vehicle, an IDIQ contract SLMAQM 01 D 0013 with Motorola Corporation has exercised its last option year, and a new refresh contract is in negotiations between Motorola and Department of State. The life cycle for the deployed radio system has four more years in which operations and maintenance are required to continue. 	The justification for sole sourcing with Motorola Corporation is due to the Motorola proprietary embedded signal algorithms essential to the compatibility of the network.  In addition, the Federal Flash algorithm which allow the federal government to deploy the zoned radios globally. Without it a radio can not access these networks and communicate emergency instructions.  This is the MDC1200 signaling algorithm. 	The Radio Programs Branch relies on Motorola equipment to meet the requirements of the O&M phase now in existence.<BR><BR>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.           It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.           Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.           Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.           Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.           Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

DCHA staff in Sudan work within the USAID Mission in Khartoum.  DCHA staff in Khartoum, Sudan include representatives from OFDA, the Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), fall under the overall management of the DCHA Senior Humanitarian Advisor (SHA) based in Khartoum.  Other USAID Mission staff are in Khartoum and the southern capital, Juba. The DCHA staff are divided into two operational teams, one covering Darfur and one covering Southern Sudan.  The DCHA Team Leader for Darfur is responsible for DCHA programs, staff and activities in the Darfur Field Office.  The DCHA Team Leader for the South, who is based in Juba, is responsible for DCHA programs, staff and activities in the South.  There is close daily coordination between the DCHA units in Nairobi/Juba and Khartoum, and with the development programs managed by the rest of the USAID mission (both in Khartoum and Nairobi/Juba).

The Sudan Information Officer (SIO) will work and live in Khartoum, reporting to the SHA and closely coordinating with the OFDA Sudan team in Washington D.C.  S/he will collect, analyze, report and distribute information on the humanitarian situation and DCHA programs in Sudan, although the primary emphasis and majority of the workload will likely be on Darfur, at least in the initial period of deployment.  The SIO will draft cables, briefing papers, talking points, and other information products.  S/he will coordinate closely with IOs in Washington on the Sudan team, responding to their information requests and closely synchronizing DCHA Sudan information products.  S/he will coordinate information gathering and sharing with the USAID Mission, the U.S. Embassy (including the Embassy Public Affairs Officer and the USAID Development Outreach Communications Officer), other donor countries, and the United Nations (UN), International Organizations (IOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

OBJECTIVE

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Sudan Information Officer (SIO) will provide full-time, in-country information gathering, analysis, reporting and dissemination of the humanitarian emergency and DCHA programs in Sudan, with an emphasis on Darfur.

This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as representatives from other USAID offices and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style.

The SIO's responsibilities are:

* Serve as the principle contact point for information in Sudan on humanitarian issues.  
* Coordinate closely with the DCHA Darfur and Southern Sudan Teams and maintain regular contact with OFDA Sudan team members in Washington, D.C.
* Provide information coverage on Sudan.  Information products will include, but not be limited to, OFDA situation reports/fact sheets, briefing papers, talking points, cables, and reports.
* Attend briefings and meetings on disaster situations, take meeting notes, monitor and collect information, and draft reports and other information products.
* Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keep the DCHA Team Leaders current on key issues.  Provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts.
* Coordinate information gathering and sharing with UN agencies, IOs and NGOs.  Meet regularly with U.S. government personnel, donors, Sudanese authorities, and others on humanitarian issues.  
* As requested, support OFDA's Geographic Information Unit in the preparation and updating of humanitarian mapping products for Sudan.
* As requested, take field trips (security permitting) to assess, evaluate and report on conditions at OFDA project sites in Sudan, coordinating with DCHA field officers.  
* Continually collect and verify information, identify trends and provide analysis of ongoing humanitarian issues, such as insecurity or displacement, in close coordination with the DCHA Team Leaders.
* Report on joint donor humanitarian evaluations and UN-led assessments.
* Participate in development and implementation of OFDA and USAID strategy and plans for Sudan by providing relevant information to inform the policy planning process as appropriate.
* As requested, support OFDA's Information Support Unit (ISU) in the development of OFDA's Annual Report by writing articles on humanitarian assistance in Sudan.
* Backstop Washington Sudan Team information specialists, as requested, on Sudan-related issues.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS

The incumbent will act under the direction of the SHA. The supervisor will provide administrative direction in terms of goals and specific objectives and outputs.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-16.

This is an "open-market" solicitation.  GSA Vendors are encouraged to provide a quotation in response to this solicitation.  However, the Government's terms and conditions identified herein take precedence.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.

To support the development of standards for trace explosive detection, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Trace Explosives Analyzer to be used in the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division, Analytical Microscopy Group, at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, to analyze and quantify trace amounts of explosive compounds.

The mission of NIST, as mandated by Congress, is to develop and promote measurements, standards, and technology to enhance productivity, facilitate trade, and improve the quality of life.  Reliable standards are needed to test the performance and effectiveness of trace explosive detectors, which protect the public and infrastructure of the U.S.  Currently, NIST has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art microanalytical instrumentation, ion mobility spectrometers, and inkjet printers for the development of trace explosive reference materials. This program is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of organizations and agencies that use trace explosive detectors. A critical requirement for NIST is to validate the quantities of trace explosives on samples such as test swipes and reference materials. For this purpose, NIST has several systems in place, but these systems lack the sensitivity and precision needed for validating deposits of trace explosives at picogram levels.  Gas chromatography with electron capture detection is a potentially acceptable technology, although other systems may be acceptable as well. 

All interested Contractor?s shall provide a quote for the following line items(s):

Line Item 0001:  The contractor shall furnish one (1) each, trace explosives analyzer.

The analyzer shall meet or exceed the following minimum technical specifications:

1.	The system must be able to analyze microliter-sized liquids for trace explosives.
2.	It is recommended that the proposed detection system not be based on mass spectrometry, since these detectors are currently well represented in our laboratory and cannot meet the reproducibility requirement.
3.	The following analytes must be separable and detectable below 10 picograms in mass, and below 10 micrograms per liter in acetonitrile: cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol-tetranitrate (PETN), and trinitrotoluene (TNT).  Please note other specific analytes and performance criteria under ?Stronger Considerations? below.
4.	For all required analytes, reproducibility of signals (relative standard deviation of the mean) at the 10 picogram level must be better than 2 percent.
5.	Documentation must be provided regarding system sensitivity (limits of detection, SEE NOTE 1) and analytical precision to the analytes named above.  This documentation may be either in commercial specification sheets or test reports. The purpose is to establish the sensitivity limits that will be used during acceptance tests (described below).
6.	The system must be operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.

NOTE 1:  The limit of detection (LOD) is commonly accepted as the smallest amount of a particular substance that can be reliably detected in a given type of medium by a specific measurement process. The analytical signal from this amount must be high enough above background variations to give statistical confidence that the signal is real, so the LOD is normally defined as the amount of substance that generates an average signal three times higher than the standard deviation of the background signal or analytical signal at LOD levels, whichever is greater. 

Installation/Training/Warranty:

1.	The contractor shall schedule and facilitate installation/set-up.  Installation, at a minimum, shall include uncrating/unpackaging of all equipment, set-up and hook-up of the instrument, demonstration of all required specifications, and removal of trash. Onsite installation and demonstration shall be done at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.

2.	The contractor shall schedule and facilitate one (1) eight hour training session for up to five (5) technicians at NIST.  The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, maintenance, data administration, and basic troubleshooting.  The training may be completed at NIST immediately after installation and demonstration of performance specifications, but no later than 30 days after installation.  The contractor shall provide a list of installation requirements, including house services and furniture, with explanations, as soon as the contract is awarded.  NIST will provide any required connections to house services.
3.	Quotation must include unlimited telephone/e-mail support during business hours, Monday through Friday, during the warranty period, for questions regarding operation, and a one-year warranty.  This warranty must cover non-consumable parts and travel/labor on-site should this become necessary within the warranty period.

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:

1.	Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
    a. The system is operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.
2.	Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.
    a.  Using standard materials supplied by NIST, the system will be required to detect any of the required analytes (deposited as solutions onto the primary collection grid) at twice the LOD or LOD90 as specified by the supplier. This level for each analyte will be the ?detector challenge? (DC)(SEE NOTE 2).   
    b.  The tests will be performed by NIST as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and will be witnessed by the contractor. The instrument must accurately identify each analyte. Upon any failure, the test for that analyte will be repeated five times. Accurate detection must occur in at least four (4) of those five analyses. 

NOTE 2: The Detector Challenge (DC), where the false negative rate should be negligible, is arbitrarily defined as the amount of substance that should generate a signal twice the DL90, so that, DC = 2 LOD90.

Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the contractor?s commercial schedule.

FOB Destination means:  The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001.

Award shall be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor ?Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement,? 2) Past Performance, 3) Past Experience, and 4) Price.  Technical capability, past performance, and past experience, when combined, shall be more important than price.

Award will be made on a best-value basis.  Under the Technical Capabilities factor, additional consideration will be given for a system with one or more of the following additional features or capabilities:

Line Item 0001:
Stronger considerations:

Stronger considerations beyond the minimum technical requirements will be based upon (in descending order): 1) superior (smaller) limits of detection for the required analytes; 2) superior reproducibility (smaller imprecision) of detection for the required analytes; 3) superior scope of detection, where the following additional analytes are examples: Triacetone triperoxide (TATP), hexamethylene triperoxide diamine  (HMTD), Octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), and ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN).

Technical Capability:  Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quotations shall include the make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature, which addresses all specifications & clearly documents that the product offered meets or exceeds the specifications identified herein.

Past Performance:  Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the products and services, provided by the Contractor.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/or information from other sources, including NIST.  Offerors shall provide a list of at least three (3) references to whom the same or similar products have been sold.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum:  the name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer, if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed.

Past Experience:  Past Experience will be evaluated to determine the degree of vendors? experience in successfully providing comparable systems for the types of applications described herein.  Evaluation of past experience may be based on contacts used for past performance; however, the vendor should provide additional references relating to its past experience information, if necessary.
Past Performance, Past Experience, and Price will not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable in accordance with the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

<DESC>CLOSING DATE and TIME:   	July 16, 2007 at 18:00 hrs. Washington D.C. (July 17 at 05:00 hrs. Bangkok time)

MARKET VALUE:						Equivalent to GS-13	

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE				The Personal Services Contract 									will be for 24 months

SECURITY ACCESS:					Secret

AREA OF CONSIDERATION: 	US Citizens or Third Country Nationals

A. BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION:

The Senior Acquisition and Assistance Specialist is a primary and key procurement person assisting the USAID Regional Development Mission/Asia (RDMA/A), Afghanistan/Office of Acquisition and Assistance (Afghan/OAA) with achieving implementation results, supporting the acquisition and assistance activities of USAID/Afghanistan Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA), and therefore fulfilling their individual goals and objectives.  S/he does this by applying high-level acquisition and assistance (A&A) knowledge, skills and abilities while working as independently as possible on activity design and implementation related A&A assignments.  Responsibilities involve a wide range of A&A actions which includes complex performance based and cost type contracts, plus there is a requirement that s/he functions effectively within his/her assigned area (on both a technical and communication basis).  

While there is an element of repetition (e.g., similar actions within broad procedural groupings), individual actions can be unique and multifaceted.  USAID/Afghanistan has a varied and complex country program having multi-million dollar contract and assistance actions, very complex multi-sectoral programs with numerous projects, high funding levels and significant infrastructure work.  The job may involve infrastructure (design, engineering and construction) actions covering various industry sectors. 

Besides being able to apply professional procurement skills multisectorally, incumbent will be expected to deal with multiple U. S. and host government entities and the complications of cross cultural business dealings.  TDY travel to Kabul, Afghanistan will be required in this position.  Assignments will generally be long-term in nature, and besides A&A expertise, knowledge of economic and project management procedures and principles, program structures and monitoring is required.

B. SPECIFIC DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: 

The Senior Acquisition and Assistance Specialist may serve as an advisor for a broad range of USAID A&A activities, to include high dollar, complex competitive procurement actions, but also assistance (grants and cooperative agreements), modifications, delivery and purchase orders, interagency agreements and supply schedule or other related actions.   S/he exercises leadership in conducting technically proficient procurement and assistance, fully complying with all relevant laws, regulations and procedures and performed in a positive, team and customer oriented manner. S/he has workday decision-making authority in the many aspects of the broad areas of acquisition and assistance. 

1.	PRE-AWARD EXPERTISE AND SERVICES:  Performs or directs all actions required to conceptualize, plan, solicit, negotiate and award many kinds of acquisition and assistance actions of varying complexity.  Conducts A&A planning and subsequent pre-award activities fully supportive of USAID?s strategic and special objectives and related results expectations and requirements.

a.	Fully understands performance based A&A principles with a resulting capability to meld acquisition and assistance services into specific contributions to appropriate USAID objectives and lower level indicators, outputs and inputs.

b.	Organizes, directs, conducts and/or coordinates pre-bid/pre-proposal conferences for complex procurement actions, especially construction or architect-engineering actions, but also for complicated services (and perhaps even commodities).  Ensures the proper establishment of requirements for bid and/or performance bonding in applicable requests for proposals.

c.	Reviews requests for A&A actions (to include consulting on scope of work or program description documents), and manages the A&A process whereby the comprehensive requirements of the Federal and USAID Acquisition Regulations (FAR and AIDAR), Contract Information Bulletins (CIBs), Acquisition and Assistance Policy Directives (AAPDs), Procurement Executive Bulletins (PEBs), Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Office of Management & Budget Circulars (OMB Circulars),  Automated Directive System (ADS), etc., are used to competitively, (or when justified, via other means), proceed through the entire offer/application solicitation process.  The incumbent must manage the technical and cost/price evaluation process plus subsequent negotiation processes in all actions (competitive or otherwise) to arrive at business management-appropriate instruments, including grants and cooperative agreements, etc.  This includes completing fully documented files with certifications, negotiation memoranda reflecting complete explanations for Contracting Officer decision rationales, a comprehensive record of commitments and obligations of the parties.  Generally, the incumbent manages the award process from beginning to conclusion with fully prepared contract or assistance documents.

2.	POST-AWARD EXPERTISE AND SERVICES:  Performs all actions required to administer the complete variety of A&A instruments from contractor/recipient mobilization through to closeout.  Relies on a comprehensive mastery of the Mission Strategic Objective (SO) Plan, FAR, AIDAR, ADS, CFR, OMB Circulars and other procurement/assistance guidance sources to conduct output-based administration which enhances achievement of the Mission's program and assures timely delivery of the purchased supplies and/or services.  

a.	With the objective of maximizing problem avoidance over reaction, exercises a proactive role during the administration phase to include coordinating with technical, controller and legal officers, conducting meetings and conferences as required, maintaining good communications with contractors, recipients and grantees, interpreting contract or award provisions, plus negotiating and finalizing instrument modifications when warranted.  

b.	Coordinates special requirements with other US Government offices and agencies, primarily including the Inspector General, Defense Contract Audit Agency, General Accounting Office, and Small Business Administration.  Ensures that the results contractually required are documented and that A&A actions are properly closed out, to include final audits, resolving indirect cost matters and preparing any needed final modifications.  Responds to Freedom of Information Act requests.

3.  SO TEAM MEMBERSHIP AND SUPPORT SERVICES:  Serves on one or more SO Teams and/or provides support to SO team located in USAID/Afghanistan as assigned.  Collegially represents the A&A viewpoint with the objective of having all team members fully understand and appreciate the key nature of the procurement and assistance function, how to obtain needed services or assistance to meet SO time schedules, as well as the statutory and procedural requirements established by Federal and USAID authorities for the purpose of protecting the U.S. and host country partner government's best interests.

g. TIME REQUIRED TO PERFORM FULL RANGE OF DUTIES:  None.  The Acquisition and Assistance Specialist is expected to be an accomplished A&A expert when selected.

E.  SELECTION CRITERIA
Candidates will be evaluated and ranked based on the following selection criteria: 
a. WORK EXPERIENCE: (40 Points) It is highly preferred that the candidate have a minimum of 7 to 10 years of responsible, progressive experience in a relevant field, ideally obtained in an A&A or other procurement organization to include hands-on experience primarily in acquisition, but ideally including assistance as well.  Hands on USAID experience is not an absolute requirement, but would be extremely useful and will be considered as such during the evaluation. Seven or more years of overseas experience working on acquisition and assistance actions with international public or private sector organizations under demanding conditions is desired.  The job requirements include infrastructure (design, engineering and construction) experience covering various industry sectors, as well as on US Government-related and USAID A&A direct or industry competence at the prime and/or subcontractor level.  Experience reflecting exposure to and appreciation of the challenges associated with international development projects would be advantageous.
b. KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND ABILITIES: (40 Points) Applicants will be evaluated as the extent of their thorough knowledge of relevant applicable acquisition and assistance management regulatory and procedural guides, US Government and USAID acquisition and assistance regulations and practices (including laws, as applicable), host government procurement rules, as well as knowledge of how commercial businesses and nonprofit organizations (NGOs) are motivated and operate (to include marketing, accounting and administrative systems, indirect costs, and profit objectives) will be evaluated. Thorough understanding and knowledge of post award A&A administration, ideally including infrastructure and related services, is necessary.  An understanding of project planning and implementation procedures and operations, as well as infrastructure development programs is highly desirable. Candidates must possess sound and independent judgment with the skill to strategize, develop and effectively implement activities. Effective negotiating skills and the ability to work in a team context and to maintain cordial and professional relationships with Host Government, NGO and Contractor/Recipient personnel are essential. Ability to perform sophisticated analysis of budgets and contract/grant proposals is required. A high level of ability with regard to understanding contracting and assistance polices and regulations are required.  The ability to analyze situations and accurately apply those regulations to make sound business decisions is required.  Excellent interpersonal skills and a genuine interest in assisting USAID staff with expedient program implementation is necessary. A high degree of professionalism, discretion, and sound judgment in representing the US Government are essential elements of the position. A demonstrated ability to work in teams (i.e., team member, leader, coach and/or player skills) and an obvious commitment to the team-centric mode of operation combined with proven organizational and administrative skills are required.
c. EDUCATION AND LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY: (20 Points) At least a Bachelor of Science/Arts or equivalent level in Business, Procurement or Economics is desired.  A degree in Political Science, International Relations or related field with subsequent specialization in the acquisition and assistance field could substitute.  Relevant, extensive work experience, if demonstrably successful, may substitute or be given appropriate consideration. The candidate must have excellent English communication skills, both oral and written (NFATC 4/4 minimum). The candidate must have the ability to present analyses and recommendations in clear, logical written and oral formats.  Notwithstanding being allotted only up to 20 of 100 points, this is essentially a pass/fail criterion.  (Why; because logically speaking as a practical matter, the inability to work comprehensively with oral and written English would effectively disqualify a candidate from serious consideration). 
Maximum Points Available: 100.
F.  SELECTION PROCESS

After the closing date for receipt of applications, a committee will be convened to review applications and evaluate them in accord with the evaluation criteria.  To ensure an efficient competitive process, USAID reserves the right to initially screen and weed out applications from candidates who clearly do not fit the intended candidate target pool reflected in the selection criteria above.  As a simple matter of efficiency on the part of both USAID and the applicants, any such candidates will not have their applications scored according to the above criteria.  As part of the selection process, finalist candidates may be interviewed either in person or by telephone, at USAID?s discretion.  Reference checks will be made only for applicants considered as finalists. If an applicant does not wish USAID to contact a current employer for a reference check, this should be stated in the applicant?s cover letter, and USAID will delay such reference check pending communication with the applicant. Only finalists will be contacted by USAID with respect to their applications.  The final selected candidate must obtain security and medical clearances (the latter applicable to family members at post as well) within a reasonable period of time.  USAID will provide details regarding these clearances to the selected candidate.  A substantial delay in obtaining either a required clearance, or the likely expectation of same, will make the applicant ineligible for selection, as well as providing a basis for negotiating with other applicant(s).

G.  TERM OF PERFORMANCE

The term of the contract will be for two years. Within one week after written notice from the Contracting Officer that all clearances have been received or, unless another period is specified by the Contracting Officer in writing, the selected candidate shall proceed to Bangkok to perform the above services.  Future contract extension(s) will be subject to mutual agreement, satisfactory performance and the availability of funds. This position has been classified equivalent to a US Government GS 13. The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated depending on qualifications and previous salary history. Bangkok carries a 10% Post Differential in addition to salary.  Standard allowances and benefits apply (e.g. housing, education, R&R, and home leave). In addition, TDY time spent in Afghanistan carries a 35% Danger Pay allowance, and a 35% Post Differential (hardship pay) commencing on the 43rd day for lengthy TDYs. 
		
H.  APPLICATION  

Qualified individuals must submit a US Government OF-612 (or the ?obsolete? SF-171), which is available at the USAID website http://www.usajobs.opm.gov/forms.asp. It will be to the applicant?s advantage to also submit a resume to help document and elaborate on relevant work experience; in addition, it will be especially helpful to include an application-specific cover letter.

All applications should be submitted electronically to: afghanoaabangkok@usaid.gov

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
