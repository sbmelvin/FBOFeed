<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services on a sole source basis with the American College of Physicians - American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP-ASIM) Foundation for implementing a campaign to educate physician members about MEDLINEplus and to gain their support in referring their patients to MEDLINEplus.  Physician and patient focused resource materials have been developed and distributed to project participants.  The project evaluates the change in physician awareness of MEDLINEplus.gov as a source of patient health information and how the physicians used the resource materials with their patients.  It also evaluates the impact that this campaign has on influencing physicians to refer MEDLINEplus to patients, and the patients use of MEDLINEplus to access additional medical information.  The contractor will provide the detailed data tabulations and cross-tabulations, and associated explanatory narrative, resulting from pre- and post-intervention mail surveys and telephone interviews with physicians in Iowa and Georgia, as well as patient evaluations by participating patients in those states, all funded internally by the ACP-ASIM Foundation and conducted in connection with the Health Information Referral Project but as separate project activities.  The participating physicians must be members of the ACP-ASIM Foundation in those two states, and the participating patients must be patients of participating physicians.  The data sets shall include the physician responses to all questions from the pre-intervention surveys, to telephone interview questions, and to post-intervention survey questions.  These data sets were not included in the original contract with ACP-ASIM Foundation or in the original ACP-ASIM Foundation report on the project.  The tabular data shall be provided in both paper and electronic formats, to be specified by NLM.  The data narrative shall include all pertinent discussion of survey methodology, response rates, statistical validity, statistical analyses, and interpretations thereof.  The contractor shall provide NLM with one face-to-face briefing in Bethesda, MD on the survey results.  For this procurement, NLM is seeking a vendor that is fully familiar with the Health Information Referral Project and that has conducted the associated pre- and post-intervention surveys and interviews specified in the work statement or would otherwise have access to the full survey results.  The American College of Physicians - American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP-ASIM) Foundation is uniquely qualified to provide this service.  NLM reviewed the marketplace, including other medical and related academic and professional organizations, and concluded that it would be impractical and vastly more expensive for any other organization to attempt to provide a report and data on the survey results.  The surveys would have to be replicated in their entirety by another organization, an unrealistic as well as costly option, or the survey data would have to be licensed from the ACP-ASIM Foundation at additional cost.   NLM staff determined that the ACP-ASIM Foundation is the only vendor that meets the requirements of this procurement.  This service will be procured under FAR Part 13: Simplified Acquisitions.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm's ability to meet the Government's requirements.  Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 03-248 shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Michael G. Kapsilis, Contract Specialist (301) 496-6546 kapsilm@mail.nlm.nih.gov or Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, (301) 496-6545.

<DESC>The 99th Contracting Squadron, Nellis AFB, Nevada intends to award a sole source, one time, firm-fixed-price order for Academic Support of the Air Ground Operations School to provide advanced training to senior enlisted terminal air controllers to CBD Training, Inc. of St. Petersburg, Florida.  Statutory authority for this sole source purchase is Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented in FAR 6.302-1. This is a follow-on award of highly specialized services from the original source.  It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  This notice is for informational purposes only. Response is not solicited or expected.

Research to determine the overall population trend of the endangered plant palmate-bracted bird's-beak (Cordylanthus palmatus).  Demographic factors to be qualified include percent survival, reproductive success, and the density of ungerminated seeds in the soil.  Specifc objectives include (1) determine whether the Alkali Sink Ecological Reserve population of palmate-bracted bird's-beak is stable or declining; (2) plants growing adjacent to the road have reduced survival and reproduction compared to plants growing in the midst of unaltered areas; (3) compare reproductive output of palmate-bracted bird's-beak at Alkali Sink Ecological Reserve, Springtown Alkali Sink and the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge compled and (4) bank seeds from Springtown Alkali Sink and the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge complex.  The  authority under FAR 6.302-1 " other than full and open competition" will be the authority to make an award to (ESPR) Endangered Species Recovery Program, inititated by the action of the Fish & Wildlife Service under the 1991 Friant Biological Opinion for renewal of long term water service contracts.  Their academic affiliation provides scientific integrity and crediability, a necessary component when working with highly endangered species.  ESRP was established to gather scientific data and provide major assistance with the writing of a San Joaquin Valley multi-species Recovery Plan which provided a greater benefit to the public by preventing species from becoming more endangered or extinct.

<DESC>NA Contact is Michael Conner at michael.conner@wainwright.army.mil.  Fax 907-353-7302.  Phone 907-353-6019.   This equipment will be placed upon a paved, enclosed area used as an ice skating rink during the winter months.  The space available for set up is 190 feet by 80 feet with rounded corners. The equipment must be mobile.  With reasonable effort, moderately skilled maintenance staff members must be able to disconnect, disassemble and move this equipment, using fork lift attachments, from the ice rink in fall, for winter storage.  In the spring after melt, the equipment will need to be reassembled and function as designed with the same staff members.  The layout of the equipment must be compatible for adjustment and alteration according to safety requirements, customer demand and maintenance requ irements for the equipment. This equipment should be able to support activities for up to 34 youth at a time. All youth participating in activities are required to wear standard safety equipment, to include but not limited to:  helmets, elbow and knee pads. Operating hours for this equipment will be consistent with Youth Services operating hours.  Youth Services will put systems in place to restrict access when the equipment is closed. This equipment must be designed to be capable of enduring the harshest abuse and treatment imaginable.  The youth using the equipment will vary in size from 100 pounds to 200+ pounds. Youth services expects to have a variety of events that will support skating at a wide variety of skill levels: Quarter Pipes provide a curved surface that directs riders up and above the ramp, enabling them to perform a trick and then land back onto the ramp and roll away.  There will be a platform atop the ramp, with safety railings to reduce the risk of fall from  the height above the zero level surface. Banks are similar to quarter pipes but without the curved surface. Launch ramps are beginner type events.  They are excellent for immediate loft and help riders to learn to jump smaller obstacles and get used to up and down motion on small equipment. Spines are like two quarter pipes without the deck.  The narrow ridge on top should be protected by a thick steel coping. Pump hump is the skatepark equivalent to a roller coaster. The successful contractor should supply equipment with the following profile: PVC type coating on frame and deck pieces to reduce sound and protect events from wear and weathering. A riding surface that is fast, smooth and has grip without excessive resistance. Weather and vandal resistant panels. Durable steel panels for transitions, supported by a grid of factory welded ribs.  A fastener-free surface is preferred, as this is safer than riding over exposed screw heads. Quality transition plates that bring the surface of the pavement to the event smoothly. Framing: 1.5Ã¢Â€Â steel tubing, coated. Adjustable foot levelers that screw up or down to level ramps on uneven surfaces. Stainless steel fasteners that are weather resistant and designed to reduce acts of vandalism.
