Selection Criteria:

THe Angio dynamics Nano knife ablation device offers one of a kind cutting edge technology for the ablation of solid tumors. The system uses new 
electroporation technology to induce apoptosis in solid tumors. As such, this
technology can overcome limitations inherent in other types of ablative
technologies such as radio frequency ablation and cryo ablation due to heat sink effects from adjacent blood vessels. The technology is amenable to both image guided percutaneous approaches as well as open surgical techniques. This technology has the potential to expand the range of patients treated by
allowing patients with larger and more complex lesions to be treated
effectively. In addition, this new technology may expand treatment options to
patients that therefore were either untreatable or whose only other option was a major surgical procedure.  

                                        
 Items to be delivered to:

Selection Criteria:
EPIQ 7C Ultrasound System w/Upgrade-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ULTRASOUND

REQUEST IS FOR A NEW ULTRASOUND SYSTEM FOR THE BROOKLYN CARDIOLOGY DEPARTMENT. ITEM WAS FUNDED AND RECOMMENDED AS A LEAN INITIATIVE IMPROVEMENT.   IT WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR EXTENSIVE CHARTING IN CPRS, WILL BRING BROOKLYN CARDIOLOGY TEE PROCEDURES TO ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS - AS ALREADY ATTAINED AT THE MANHATTAN CAMPUS.  
                                 

:  An echocardiogram uses sound waves called ultrasound to look at the size, shape, and motion of the heart.  The test shows:
"	Four chambers of the heart
"	Heart valves and the walls of the heart
"	Blood vessels entering and leaving the heart
"	The sac that surrounds the heart
"	In addition to this standard test, there are specialized echocardiograms:
"	
"	Contrast echocardiogram-A solution is injected into the vein and can be     seen in the heart.
"	Stress echocardiogram-This records the heart's activity during a cardiac stress test. 
"	Echocardiogram with Doppler ultrasound-This helps your doctor assess blood flow.
"	Trans esophageal echocardiogram -To provide clear images of the heart, the ultrasound device is put down your throat. Your doctor may need to use this test depending on what part of the heart needs to be viewed. If you have the following conditions, you may need this test, rather than the standard echocardiogram: 
o	Certain lung diseases
o	Obesity
An echocardiogram may be used to:
"	Evaluate a heart murmur
"	Diagnose valve conditions
"	Find changes in the heart's structure
"	Assess motion of the chamber walls and damage to the heart muscle after a heart attack
"	Assess how different parts of the heart work in people with chronic heart disease
"	Determine if fluid is collecting around the heart
"	Identify growths in the heart
"	Assess and monitor birth defects
"	Test blood flow through the heart
"	Assess heart or major blood vessel damage caused by trauma
"	Test heart function and diagnose heart and lung problems in very ill patients
"	Assess chest pain
"	Look for blood clots within heart chambers

The requested echo ultrasound machine will be used for echocardiograms and trans esophageal echoes.  The Cardiology Section has one newer machine and one old machine only used for stress testing.  The machines require the use of a server that transmits the results.  This Server is frequently breaking down.  The requested machine will eliminate the need for external charting.  Cardiology Sections at Manhattan and the Bronx currently are in the process of transitioning to the Epiq iE33 system already purchased.  Purchasing this equipment for Brooklyn will standardize care across the Harbor, to share assets (ie. Tee transducers) and enable a seamless transition in the event of an emergency such as occurred with Hurricane Sandy.

Selection Criteria:

Dental Instruments for the Manhattan Campus of the NYHHS interruptions in patient care. These instruments are kits and hand pieces used regularly in patient treatments. Delivery of these instruments is being requested to be fulfilled as soon as possible. 

NYHHS no longer has a localized sterilization service as a result of Super
Storm Sandy. Subsequently, all instrumentation is required to be transported
off site to the Brooklyn Campus for sterilization. The delays caused be
transportation have resulted in a lag time of equipment availability from 12
hours to 24 to 48 hours. This lag time has resulted in delays of such
significance as to warrant the cancellation and rescheduling of patient care.
These additional instruments will provide an adequate supply to mitigate the
need to delay/reschedule care.

VA New York Harbor Healthcare System
MANHATTAN CAMPUS
423 East 23rd Street
New York, NY 10010

Delivery shall be coordinated with Jose Peralta- 212-686-7500 x4223. The product should be delivered during normal working hours, between 7:30am and 4:00pm, Monday through Friday.

Selection Criteria:

The request that is being submitted is for routine dental instruments that will be used to treat patients. In the past, MSI was processing dental instruments. They would regularly pick up and deliver instruments so that normal operation of the clinic was maintained. However, the MSI contract was prematurely terminated at the end of November. At this time, the processing of instruments is being done in house by SPS due to lack of other available options. However, due to the volume of instrument processing from Dental and the Operating Room/Surgical and the current resource level, SPS is unable to effectively meet the needs of all the Services. Therefore, more instruments are being ordered so that patient care within dental service can be maintained. The turnaround time currently is too long for instrument processing, causing cancellations and delays in patient treatment. 

Dental Service is requesting increasing the inventory of dental instruments since the current turnaround time for instruments after they are processed is too long and is leading to interruptions in patient care. These instruments are kits and handpieces used regularly in patient treatments. Delivery of these instruments is being requested to be fulfilled as soon as possible.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT to increase the Barksdale AFB Paving contract ceiling (Contract number FA4608-10-D-0005) from $26.5M to $30.5M because of an unforeseen increase paving requirements during the bed down of AFGSC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract was competitively awarded in July of 2010 to the Fussell Company, under the Small Business Administration's HUB Zone Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This contract included one base year and 4 option years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is in the best interest of the Government to minimize project funding risks by increasing the contract ceiling by 15% (or 4M), so that the agency can execute several FY 14 planned tasks.
<p>The paving contract has a contract ceiling of $26,497,506.06 over a five year period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract currently has less than $500,000 of ceiling with 14 months remaining under the original ordering period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This original ordering period with options expires 14 June 2015 and will not be extended.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Due to the high demand for paving requirements under this contract, capacity will soon be reached.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The intent of this action is to increase the contract ceiling in order to allow adequate time for a follow-on contract to be completed without interrupting the agency's mission to support these activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Based on the projections of upcoming projects, an increase of $4,000,000 is required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This increase is to cover within scope changes and to perform existing and planned tasks until the new procurement is awarded, anticipated for 1 Jan 2015.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 2<sup>nd</sup> Contracting Squadron is currently in the acquisition process to award a follow on contract via a competitive small business set aside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All required specifications are being prepared and reviewed.</p>
<p>If the capacity increase is not approved, a lapse in the performance of task orders will occur, resulting in delays in providing operational airfield repair capabilities to adequately support the mission here at Barksdale AFB.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also important to note that many of the projects referenced below were FY 13 designed and negotiated under the current contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Should the increased capacity not be approved, these specific projects will need to be redesigned which would result in additional costs to taxpayers and delays in providing operational airfield capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The main projects to be awarded under the paving contract, based on approved capacity are:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Repair Airfield Pavements, Repair Airfield Joint seals, Repair runway transition area, Bravo to Echo, Repair range road Phase 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Due to the unanticipated magnitude of task orders awarded in FY 13 and prior years, the IDIQ is has reached the exhaustion point of the original capacity prior to expiration of the performance period, 14 June 2015.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additional capacity is required to award task orders as well as support any unforeseen contract modifications on existing FY13 and FY14 task orders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Approval through proper Air Force channels to increase the capacity of the paving contract will be obtained.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within 15 days after the publication date of this notice of contract action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All information received within the 15 days will be considered by the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written noticeto the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the System for Award Management at http://sam.gov <BR> <BR>
