<p><strong>DISCLAIMER AND NOTICE: THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION SOLICITED.</strong>&nbsp; This RFI is solely for the identification of potential business sources for the above-stated acquisition program for market research and planning purposes only, and DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.&nbsp; Any response to this notice is NOT AN OFFER and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.&nbsp; Responders are solely responsible for any and all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.&nbsp; The Government will not reimburse responders for any presentations, marketing efforts, or data related to their responses.&nbsp; The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any responder's input resulting from this RFI.&nbsp; All information received in response to this RFI that is marked "proprietary" or "competition sensitive" will be handled accordingly.&nbsp; Only non-classified information shall be provided in any response.&nbsp; Copies of submitted information may be reproduced for Government review.&nbsp; Responses to this RFI will not be returned.</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION:</strong> The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research to determine the existence of prospective responsible Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified sources that can carry out combined C-130J Block 7.0/Block 8.1 retrofit kit building and/or combined C-130J Block 7.0/Block 8.1 aircraft retrofit installations on approximately five (5) aircraft per year, with a surge capability of an additional two (2) to three (3) aircraft per year, for an estimated ten (10) year period.&nbsp; Responses from such sources will be utilized by acquisition personnel for the Government's scheduling, budgeting, and program planning requirements in order to determine the best acquisition strategy for both the retrofit kit building phase and the aircraft kit installation phase of this retrofit program.&nbsp; Responses will also be used to determine if either or both of these efforts can be competitive in nature and/or pursued as partial or total Small Business Set-Aside acquisitions.&nbsp; The Government is interested in responses from all responsible businesses, including small business concerns, disadvantaged business concerns, Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns, and Historically Underutilized Business zone (HUBZone) small business concerns.</p>
<p>There is a vital need to modify existing C-130J aircraft to add new capabilities and meet future aircraft operational requirements, new airspace use mandates, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements.&nbsp; Without Block 8.1 modifications, C-130J aircraft will not be able to effectively operate in prescribed airspaces. The Block 8.1 modification installs the following major capabilities and upgrades onto the C-130J weapon system: Numerous software upgrades; new Communications, Navigation, and Identification System Processor (CNI-SP); Link-16; new control wheel; new Civil Global Positioning System (GPS); new mission computer; upgraded Data Transfer and Diagnostic System (DTADS); new Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Transponder Mode 5; Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B); enhanced internal-communication system (ICS); Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) Data Link; improved public address (PA) system; and covert light aft of the cargo ramp.</p>
<p>Retrofit kit building efforts shall include both Group "A" and Group "B" kit builds.&nbsp; Group "A" kits consist of numerous consumable parts such as wiring, plugs, and hardware to integrate Block 8.1 capabilities onto C-130J aircraft.&nbsp; Group "B" kits include Block 8.1 hardware units, as well as related non-consumable hardware parts and associated licenses.</p>
<p>Market research is being conducted to seek qualified sources that have built C-130 modification kits and/or installed C-130 system modifications, and have the skills, knowledge, and resources required to complete C-130J Block 8.1 kit building and/or aircraft retrofit kit installation efforts.&nbsp; The Government is seeking qualified sources to provide integration services, production capabilities, and installation services.&nbsp; The USAF is in the process of preparing documentation to gain the required approvals to move forward with an appropriate acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>The C-130J IPO is estimating C-130J Block 8.1 kit procurements will need to begin in Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, with kit installations commencing as early as FY 2018.&nbsp; The schedule will include the production of one (1) First Article product and time for the Government to perform a Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) of the First Article.&nbsp; The commercial full-rate production program is estimated to take ten (10) to eleven (11) years to complete, with a flow rate of five (5) aircraft per year for an estimated ten (10) year period, with the possibility of a surge of an additional two (2) to three (3) aircraft per year.&nbsp; Estimated hours for Block 8.1 modifications are approximately 5,500 to 7,000 hours per aircraft, dependent on the C-130J variant, and should take approximately seventy-five (75) days or less to install.&nbsp; A commercial warranty is expected to be included.&nbsp; Responders should plan to deliver aircraft on-site with government inspection and acceptance requirements to be spelled out in the Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>All required parts lists, installation instructions, and kit building and retrofit schedules will be provided by the Government at the time of proposal solicitation.&nbsp; The drawings for these efforts (as well as all attachments) are export controlled and shall require a DD Form 2345 (U.S./Canada Joint Certification) to be on file with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).&nbsp; Information on applying for this certification can be obtained online at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/.&nbsp; Drawings will NOT BE RELEASED to a responder without an approved DD Form 2345 on file with DLA.</p>
<p>Products shall be marked in accordance with MIL-STD-129P, Military Shipping Label Requirements, and MIL-STD-130N, DoD Standard Practice Identification Marking of U.S. Military Property.&nbsp; Some products shall also be required to be Item Unique Identification (IUID) compliant and will be spelled out in the contract.</p>
<p>An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with range pricing is being considered to fulfill these requirements.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION REQUESTED:</strong> Interested parties are requested to submit a letter of interest and a current capabilities briefing.&nbsp; <em>The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 336411, Aircraft Manufacturing/Aircraft Conversions (i.e., major modifications to system).</em>&nbsp; The Government requests interested parties responding to this RFI identify their business status.&nbsp; Responders shall provide a description of similar services offered to the Government and/or commercial customers for the past five (5) years.&nbsp; Any responses involving teaming agreements shall delineate between the work to be accomplished by the prime contractor and by all teaming partners.&nbsp; If interested parties believe they can perform a significant portion, but not all, of the requirements outlined above, please outline the portion of the requirements that can be performed.<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>Information posted in this RFI is preliminary in nature and is subject to change in the release of the official RFP (release date not yet determined).</em>&nbsp; The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Army Contracting Command-Redstone anticipates a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) and Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) modification to existing Contract W58RGZ-12-C-0075 with General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., Poway, CA for continued Performance Based Logistics Support for MQ-1C Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System Quick Reaction Capability. The effort will be performed at the UAS Training Base, Ft. Huachuca, AZ; Dugway Proving Ground, UT; National Training Center, CA; Edwards Air Force Base, CA; and El Mirage, CA, in support of QRC training, operations and equipment maintenance.  The OCONUS support will be for current Gray Eagle QRC 1 and QRC 2 unit deployment sites.  The planned period of performance is for up to five months.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this contract modification shall be awarded on an other than full and open competitive basis to General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc.  Award to other than intended source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered.  All responses should be directed to Debra R. Wood at debra.r.wood2.civ@mail.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days of the notice. This notice of intent to negotiate a sole source modification to Contract W58RGZ-12-C-0075 is not a request for competitive proposals.  This is not a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis to modify contract W9113M-13-C-0002 with General Dynamics Advanced Information System (GD-AIS), 12450 Fair Lakes Circle<br />Fairfax, VA 22033. DTRA requires an increase to the ceiling of the Procurement CLINs to satisfy necessary procurement requirements for materials and equipment for the remainder of the contract as well as continued regular preventative and occasional unscheduled maintenance as well as timely repair or replacement of mechanical and electronic items and subsystems that may fail so as to restore the station to a fully operational condition. The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1).
<p>GD-AIS is the only responsible source that can accomplish the specified radionuclide support requirements at this time. The scope of the existing contract includes regular preventative and occasional unscheduled maintenance as well as timely repair or replacement of mechanical and electronic items and subsystems that may fail so as to restore the station to a fully operational condition.</p>
<p>The NACT program office has assessed that the available procurement ceiling on the contract is insufficient to cover necessary procurement requirements for materials and equipment for the remainder of the contract. As a result, DTRA requires an increase to the contract ceiling.</p>
<p>This notice of contract action is not a request for competitive proposals; no formal solicitation will be issued as a result of this announcement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. A determination to proceed with this effort on a sole source basis based upon capability statements received and evaluated in response to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for national maintenance and logistics support services of Northrop Grumman manufactured Rapid Deployment Voice Switching (RDVS), Enhanced Terminal Voice Switch (ETVS), and Small Tower Voice Switch (STVS) systems, which provide voice communications switching in Air Traffic Control Facilities and Automated Flight Service Station facilities.  These systems also provide voice communications among flight service specialists, air traffic controllers and aircraft.  This request includes requirements for logistics and component repair service; the provision of consumable items and materials; component exchange and repair services; test bed system repair and maintenance; maintenance engineering services; system moves, changes, and relocation tasks; system position expansion tasks; and system functional enhancement tasks.  Vendors are requested to demonstrate experience and capabilities of providing the requested services for Northrop Grumman RDVS, ETVS, and STVS equipment. Northrop Grumman maintains proprietary rights to hardware and software design, firmware and drawings required to fulfill this requirement.  Potential sources must provide documentation to the FAA showing that their company is capable of providing maintenance services for these Northrop Grumman proprietary systems along with the ability to obtain required parts from the original equipment manufacturer.   Substitution with like items is not acceptable. Therefore, the FAA is conducting this market survey to seek potential sources capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements.  Specific requirements are identified in the Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work, attached.  Any vendor that believes it can provide these services is invited to submit a capability statement (in contractor format) addressing its abilities to meet all the requirements identified below and in the attached Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work.

Any contract that may result from this market survey is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price with limited Time and Material Support Contract Line Items (CLINS) for a base period of performance of one (1) year and four (4) one- (1-) year option periods if needed.  

At this time the nature of any final competition for a contract that may result from this market survey has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of an anticipated procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBAs 8(a) Program.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 811213 Communication Equipment Repair and Maintenance with a small business size standard of $11 Million average annual receipts.

PURPOSE:	
This market survey is designed to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST:
The FAA requires proof of documentation from interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and from eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Program.

In order to help the FAA make this determination and for a submission to be considered responsive, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

a.	Capability Statement (addressing the ability to meet all the requirements identified in the Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work)
b.	Completed Business Declaration Form (attached)
c.	Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form or proof of documentation from service-disabled veteran-owned small business (if applicable).

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Leica Microsystems, 1700 Leider Lane, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089-6622 to provide maintenance services on four (4) point scanning Leica microscopes located in the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) has four (4) Leica point scanning microscopes (three multiphoton / confocal and one confocal only) that are in need of service maintenance agreements (SMAs) to ensure their continued function. These microscopes are located in three (3) laboratories in the DIR (the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics, the Genetics and Developmental Biology Center, and the NHLBI Light Microscopy Core) and are used on a daily basis to provide imaging capabilities for NHLBI-DIR researchers involving fluorescence microscopy experiments. These microscopes are very complicated and delicate scientific instruments that typically require many service visits over the course of a year.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is for a contractor to provide maintenance support for these Leica point scanning microscopes. The SMA shall cover onsite and/or offsite repair, labor, parts, and travel costs associated with keeping these microscopes properly working.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>-	Standard gold service maintenance agreement on the following microscopes:<br />o	SP5 IR AOBS 561 Tandem OPO/MP (Serial No. 5100001188)<br />o	SP5 IR Ready Tandem Scan Dichroic (Serial No. 5100001322)<br />o	SP5 AOBS 561 LSR (Serial No. 5100000132)<br />o	SP8 LIAchroics Compact GB (Serial No. 8100000473)<br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance will be one (1) year with potential for four (4) option years. The maintenance services are estimated to begin on December 2, 2014.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that Leica Microsystems is the manufacturer of these microscopes and only the manufacturer is authorized to provide maintenance or repair. Any third party performing maintenance would immediately void the warranty. Replacement parts must also be compatible with existing equipment and can only be provided by Leica Microsystems.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance, and the Small Business Size Standard is $20.5M. However, this acquisition is not set aside for small businesses. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable and the resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-77 (November 13, 2014).</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.

Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by December 1, 2014 at 9:00am EST and must reference synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2015-029-JML.  Responses shall be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6151, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Jonathan M.

It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursable option type contract will be awarded for a one year base period of performance with a one year optional period beginning on or about July 22, 2015.<br /><br />
<p><strong>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop routine measurements of health outcomes for older adults living in the community with multiple chronic conditions, through validated patient-reported outcome measures of health, functional status and quality of life and to conduct research suitable for inclusion in materials to be submitted for quality measure endorsement by the National Quality Forum (NQF). The targeted care settings are ambulatory or delivery system level.</p>
<p>This project consists of two phases, each of which shall produce a report suitable for inclusion in a submission to the NQF for endorsement of a performance measure on health related quality of life for persons living with MCC. In this project, MCC should be defined consistent with DHHS (two or more conditions that last a year or more and require ongoing medical attention and/or limit activities of daily living), including at least 10 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population. The project reports shall address NQF's Measurement Evaluation Criteria for the proposed performance measure. The report shall address the criteria that are current as of the initiation of work, include the importance, scientific acceptability, feasibility, and usability of the study (at present they are dated November 2012 and are available online at http://www.qualityforum.org/docs/measure_evaluation_criteria.aspx). Phase 1 (Base) addresses Veterans Rand 12 (VR-12) while Phase 2 (Option) addresses Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29.  A strongly justified alternate proposal for a different measure for Phase 1 may be considered acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT REQUIRMENTS:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A.	Phase 1 (Base)</span></p>
<p>Phase 1 involves the analysis of existing data on health-related quality of life on persons with MCC during the first 12 month period. The Offeror shall propose a Patient Reported Outcome (PRO)-based performance measure, with a preference for the VR-12-item Health Survey, Short-Form 36 (SF-36) or Short-Form 12 (SF-12), and perform the following:</p>
<p>I.Construct the PRO performance measure by using average change or percentage improved over time (functional stability or functional gain). Specify how the PRO will be used to determine the numerator, the method for including persons with MCC in the denominator, and any exclusion. Present a strong justification for the choice and indicate why it is superior to potential alternative measures.</p>
<p>II.Refine the performance measure and conduct analyses in a sample of MCC patients from available data against the NQF criteria, for reliability, validity, and threats to validity. The analysis of threats to validity shall measure exclusions; missing data or poor response rate; case mix differences and risk adjustment; discrimination of performance.</p>
<p>III.Develop and refine risk adjustment of the performance measure using available data and modeling. Evaluate and compare random-effects and fixed-effects approaches. Examine model stability. Evaluate potential risk-adjustment considering potential patient factors: socio-demographic, dual status, comorbidity, disability, and other clinical factors. Consider current NQF guidance on use of socioeconomic status as an adjustment factor.</p>
<p>IV.Using the existing data and simulations, assess the potential for the performance measure to demonstrate differences between ambulatory practices; similarly assess the potential to demonstrate differences between health care systems. Consider variations in sample size and proxy response rates. Propose suggestions for future collection of PRO-Performance Measure data.</p>
<p>V.Prepare documents describing the work to be conducted in Phase 2 that can be submitted to obtain human subjects review/clearance and for NIH clinical exemption from OMB clearance (included in Base Period).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Source of Data for Phase 1:</span></p>
<p>For this phase, the Offeror shall specify and justify their proposed source of secondary data which is suitable for conducting the required analyses, and assure its availability. The Offeror shall provide sample size, disease ascertainment, outcome measures and a power calculation for the main analyses. Potential sources of available data for this phase include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1)The Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (http://www.hosonline.org/Content/Default.aspx) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</p>
<p>2)Health ABC (http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/ledb/healthabc/index.htm) available from the National Institute on Aging;</p>
<p>3)Linkage of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) with the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) known as SEER-MHOS and available from the National Cancer Institute;</p>
<p>4)Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) which is co-sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).</p>
<p>Currently, as part of the MHOS, Medicare Advantage (managed care) plans collect information on limited health outcome measures in older adults, including:</p>
<p>I.Proportion of patients with improved or maintained physical health over two years based on patient self-report to the VR-12-item Health Survey.</p>
<p>II.	Proportion of patients with improved or maintained mental health over two years based on patient self-report to the VR-12-item Health Survey.</p>
<p>These measures are reported to the public in aggregate and used by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide Medicare Advantage Organizations with quality bonus payments based on their performance compared to a benchmark. Currently these measures are reported for all adults (mostly above age 65 years) enrolled in Medicare Advantage health plans, a self-selected group of Medicare beneficiaries. Because the report covers a general older adult population, it is not known if disparities exist, and to what degree, in the quality of care provided specifically for older adults with MCC as measured by these outcomes. It is also unclear if there is variation in the magnitude of the disparity across health providers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B.	Phase 2 (Option)</span></p>
<p>Phase 2 involves the collection and analysis of data using the PROMIS-29 profile and other instruments from a sample of persons age 65 and over with MCC.  Many short forms developed by the PROMIS group for self-administration to patients have been tested for reliability, face validity (through focus groups, expert panels, cognitive interviewing), construct validity (convergent and discriminate validity) and differential item functioning testing. The PROMIS tools, in particular the PROMIS-29 Profile measure, have not been extensively tested in an adult population age 65 and over.  Testing of the PROMIS measures was done via the internet with a primarily healthy adult population. The sample size of older adults, particularly the very old (over age 80 years), was limited.  Additional research and analysis is necessary to test the validity of the PROMIS tools in an older adult population with multiple chronic conditions and advance toward a potential quality measure for outpatient care.</p>
<p><strong>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES:<br /><br /></strong>The Offeror shall be required to deliver/perform the following: 1) Monthly calls with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR); 2) Semi-Annual Progress Reports; 3) Draft and Final Reports and the end of each phase; 4) Draft data sets and manuscripts; 5) Overall Final Project Report.</p>
<p><br /><strong>OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990 with a size standard of $15.0 million.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.

The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS), on behalf of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) intends to sole source to:<br /><br />Elsworth Dory Support System<br />6101 Marlin Lane<br />Camp Springs, MD 20748
<p><br />CSAT seeks to obtain 12 months of expert consultation services to help: (1) assure that CSAT's regulation of Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) is consistent with current regulations and state and federal inspections reports; (2) provide technical assistance and materials development to assist states in providing treatment services; (3) assist CSAT in consultations with treatment providers; and (4) create updated standards for on-site inspections.</p>
<p>Elsworth Dory is uniquely qualified to perform these services. Formerly, Mr. Dory held the position of Investigator for the Narcotic Treatment Program Team in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Division of Scientific Investigations. In this position, he was responsible for assuring treatment program compliance and routinely guided his team through a myriad of functions, including: (1) review and approval of methadone maintenance and Levomethadyl acetate (LAAM) outpatient and hospital treatment program applications; (2) review and approval of patient exception requests and program updates; (3) maintenance of the National Directory of Approved Narcotic Treatment Programs; (4) liaison activities with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and state/local narcotic treatment program officials; and (5) enforcement activities such as review of inspection reports, issuance of warning letters, and withdrawing treatment program approval.</p>
<p>Mr. Dory's qualifications are enhanced by his expertise in both investigative and compliance methods. Mr. Dory has taught the first and every subsequent update of SAMHSA/CSAT courses covering compliance with the FDA Narcotic Addict Treatment Act regulations. He has been a member of the Interagency Narcotics Treatment Policy Review Board and is a key resource to federal agencies, including SAMHSA, FDA, and DEA, among others.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement that speaks to the services SAMHSA/CSAT is seeking in this proposed acquisition. The email subject line must reference SAM136791. All responses are due by December 10, 2014, 8:00 AM Eastern Time and can be sent to Khristine Agnello at Khristine.Agnello@psc.hhs.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract base upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Surge Protection Program replaces multiple electronic components which make up the voltage regulator and capacitor kits. The kits were initially fielded as part of a Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) in late 2005. The TCTO was not completed before the kit supply was exhausted. The ICBMSD is looking for potential sources of 42 voltage regulator kits and 57 Surge Capacitor kits to complete the TCTO. These kits provide critical updates to ICBM ground power system located at 450 Minuteman Missile Launch Facilities (LFs) at three missile wings. The initial delay in TCTO completion will necessitate procurement and installation of these kits expeditiously due to other pending power system modifications.

<DESC>This questionnaire applies to the US Army's conversion effort for the existing fleet of M3A3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV).  The intent is to convert the M3A3 vehicles into the M2A3 Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) to meet future fielding requirements. Prior to the actual conversion of the vehicles, an Inspect and Repair Only As Necessary (IROAN) effort will be required. Potential Suppliers that have not previously completed a major Bradley production program will be required to complete vehicle qualification testing at the corresponding Government test sites. <br>  <br> The purpose of this questionnaire is to evaluate the capability of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) or other qualified equipment rebuilders to convert and support this equipment.  This questionnaire is designed to gauge the interest and current capability of industry.  The total estimated quantity of M3A3 to M2A3 vehicles to be converted is 150 each. The vehicles will be provided incrementally over a three-year period.  <br>

<p>4. Demonstrate understanding of the LTPAC assessment reporting process, and its associated complexities and dependencies.

<DESC>The Dugway Proving Ground S/K Challenge is an OSD effort to collaborate and reduce costs of equipment testing. The annual event allows groups to utilize Dugway Proving Ground, UT test facilities to demonstrate and collect data on their equipment and processes in a more economical environment.

This requirement is for the rental of a concert hall and advertising for The U.S. Army Field Band (TUSAFB) Christmas Concert being held December 6 and 7.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a Single Source, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s Office of Superfund Regional Procurement Operations Division, intends to award a sole source firm-fixed priced purchase order for an asymmetric flow-field-flow fractionator (AF-4) to allow for fractionation of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in environmental samples.

The purchase order is intended to be issued to Postnova Analytics, 230 S. 500 E., Suite 120, Salt Lake City, UT 84102.  

Characterization of nanomaterials is one of the core tasks of the Office of Research and Development (ORD)-Chemical Safety and Sustainability (CSS) Emerging Materials Program.  A fundamental characteristic of ENMs is the size or more specifically the hydrodynamic diameter.  AF-4 is one of the primary accepted methodologies used to determine the hydrodynamic diameter and aggregation state of nanomaterials.  Consequently, this methodology is necessary to complete research related to the Path Forward under the ORD-CSS program to promote a sustainable approach to environmental protection.  The system uses internal pumps for both the parallel flow and cross-flow functions, whereas the other manufactured instrument relies on external pumps which are basically a system of computer controlled valves.  Because ORD-CSS program needs to have comparable data with the other EPA location, it is important to have the same calibrated pumps within the same model of instrument.  Postnova Analy tics, Inc. is the only vendor who is uniquely qualified to provide these products.  

NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated below may submit a capability statement, which if received within 5 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions and comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Manuela Meyer, Contract Specialist, at meyer.manuela@epa.gov.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND/OR ANY FOLLOW-UP REQUESTS.  No communications that request additional information or a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing this RFI to obtain contractor feedback on the draft Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) that will accompany the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for the Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) IV within the EPA Region 1.  Contractors are encouraged to provide feedback on the draft QASP at this time which will assist the EPA in finalizing the standards and acceptable quality levels (AQLs) that a contractor will be held to in performance of a Region 1 ERRS contract.  
The purpose of the ERRS IV contract requirement is to conduct emergency responses, time-critical and non time-critical removals, and remedial actions with respect to the release or threat of release of oil, hazardous and toxic wastes, petroleum products, hazardous substances, or pollutants, contaminants or fire or explosion hazards, that pose an actual or potential threat to human health or welfare, or the environment.  This effort will also include the cleanup for incidents involving weapons of mass destruction, acts of terrorism, and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) incidents.  This contract does include some substantial and segregable amounts of construction where the Construction Wage Rate Requirements, formerly known as the Davis-Bacon Act, would be applicable.  Please see the attached draft PWS for a detailed description of the requirements; the PWS is not in final form and is subject to change.  
The work will be primarily conducted within the U.S. EPA Region 1 geographic area, which includes the states of Connecticut (CT), Maine (ME), Massachusetts (MA), New Hampshire (NH), Rhode Island (RI), Vermont (VT), and 10 Tribal Nations.  Furthermore, the contractor may need to respond to unforeseen incidents, and in such cases, must be able to perform outside the region on a back-up regional, cross regional, national, and/or international response, on behalf of the EPA Region 1.  Contractors shall be able to maintain a twenty four (24) hour, seven (7) day a week year-round response capability to support such EPA needs as detailed in the PWS.
The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services, with a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of 500 employees.  The estimated length of contract for this requirement is five (5) years and the estimated maximum contract value for this regional effort is in the approximate range of $50-100 million. 
I.	Request for Information (RFI)
The EPA is planning to issue the Region 1 ERRS IV as a performance based contract.  In order to do so, performance standards and acceptable quality levels must be determined.  The EPA is providing the draft PWS and draft QASP for contractor review and comment.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This is not a solicitation announcement, nor is it a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This request does not obligate the Government in any contract award. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, is conducting market research seeking information on standard commercial practices for the acquisition and delivery of concrete to the upstream land chamber of Emsworth Lock and Dam on the Ohio River Mile 6.2, Emsworth, Pennsylvania.   <br>  <br> It is anticipated that the results of this market research will support the development of a RFQ for the requirement.  Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm's ability to submit a quote if and when a solicitation is issued.  <br>  <br> The Government will not pay for the provision of any information, nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.  <br>  <br> The scope of work involves the delivery and placement of concrete at the upstream approach to the land chamber.  Due to site restrictions (active railroad crossing, buildings, and an active lock chamber) the Government is seeking information as to the most appropriate method of delivery of approximately 20 CY of underwater concrete with anti-washout and approximately 70 CY of self-consolidating concrete. . <br>  <br> The Government may provide an area on the left abutment, upstream of the dam for crane loading of barges; however, the contractor may opt to use other suitable landings in the vicinity for loading floating plants (if necessary).   <br>  <br> Companies are encouraged to respond to this RFI with industry recommendations and or technical information.   <br>  <br> Responses must be provided no later than 12:00 PM EST on 27 November 2014 to Contract Specialist Gregory Sies, via email at Gregory.M.Sies@usace.army.mil.

The qualification package will be evaluated prior to review of the management plan and cost proposal.<br /><br />Each contractor will be ranked based on Experience, Performance and Capabilities. Only the proposals for the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>QUALIFICATION: The qualification statements will be evaluated by qualified Postal Service employees and/or Postal Service contracted professionals. Primary factors to be considered are: company background; contract experience; indefinite quantity/job order contract experience; financial stability; capacity to perform; timely completion history; references; bonding capacity; and safety.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL: Contractors will be required to submit a Management Plan and Cost Proposal. Refer to JOB ORDER CONTRACT below for details regarding the contract values.</p>
<p>MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>(1) Contractors must either have an office located in the territory or have an office located outside the territory but within 100 miles of the territory.</p>
<p>(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five (5) consecutive years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five consecutive year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained this should also be clearly explained.</p>
<p>(3) Contractors must possess a current Class A General Contractors license, if required by the state of Ohio.</p>
<p>(4) Contractors must provide proof of bonding with a minimum aggregate dollar amount of $3,000,000.</p>

The work order amount is typically within a range of $10,000 to $150,000. The Postal Service may award multiple contracts for the geographic area. Small, minority-owned, and women-owned subcontracting participation is encouraged.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>
<p>(c) DoD shall promptly review the Contractor's assessment, and the Procuring Contracting Officer shall provide a written notification to the Contractor including-</p>

<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Ombudsman Notice

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<DESC>Amendment 000001 Extension to Close 12/01/2014.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This Solicitation Notice is to announce the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for the 2-D seismic reflection data from the area of interest in accordance with the attached solicitation. The solicitation number is G15PS00024 and is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The policies contained in FAR Part 13, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation and award. This is a 100% Small Business Set-aside. The associated NAICS code is 519190 Other Information Services (Small Business Size Standard $27.5 M). A copy of this solicitation may be accessed at FedConnect, www.fedconnect.net. All requirements for preparation, submission, and receipt of offers contained in the solicitation shall be adhered to.

The Department of Interior (DOI) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) The Crustal Geophysics and Geochemistry Science Center, in collaboration with the Central Mineral and Environmental Resources and Eastern Energy and Mineral Resources Science Centers, Denver Federal Center, Lakewood, CO, USA conducts geologic investigations into the geologic framework and mineral resource potential in a region known as the Mid-continent Rift. The project is supported by the Mineral Resources Program, within the Energy and Mineral Resources Mission Area. The project area covers the midwestern states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa. Because most of the Mid-continent rift is covered by younger formations, the investigation relies heavily on subsurface information that is supplied through the use of a variety of geophysical methods and well log data. These data sources are used to determine geologic structure, stratigraphic relationships, tectonics, and geologic history as it relates to understanding the distribution of mineralization throughout the region. To this end, the USGS currently requires seismic data brokers to furnish and deliver two dimensional (2-D) multichannel seismic reflection data from an area in northern Wisconsin, where available geophysical and geologic information fall short in understanding critical questions about a scientifically important part of the Mid-continent rift.

The awarded contractor shall provide existing 2-D seismic reflection data from the area.  The data must have been acquired from and processed using the minimum standards and specifications described in the Specifications.
Evaluation - Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible seller whose bid conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other non-price factors considered. Offers submitted in response to this solicitation will be evaluated based upon the following non-price or non-cost factors, of which Factor (B) will be of most importance:

Factor (A) Past Performance: offerors shall submit not less than two references for services performed during the past three years. Each reference shall include: the company or agency name, address, contract or order number, point(s) of contract phone number and email address(es);

Factor (B) Quality of Data: All offerors must provide maps (hardcopy, jpg, or tiff) depicting the locations of available seismic data from within the area.

The USGS select lines of interest and request to view paper copies of the final processed data and make a final decision on which digital data to purchase. The digital data shall be of such quality as to allow the USGS interpreters the ability to distinguish key geologic features. Data must be of sufficient resolution to allow interpretation of subsurface structures (e.g., faults and folds, stratigraphic features such as sequence stratigraphic units, incised valley, unconformities, and pinch-outs; and diapiric structures caused by salt or mud flow). If the quality of the processed data are not of sufficient quality to allow for the interpretation of subsurface structures (e.g., faults and folds, stratigraphic features such as sequence stratigraphic units, incised valley, unconformities, and pinch-outs; and diapiric structures caused by salt or mud flow), the USGS will request access to the raw unprocessed field data in order to re-process the data with better results. The contractor offering seismic data with the highest CMP fold will be of greater technical merit.

Award shall be made to the vendor whose quotation, conforming to this solicitation, is determined to be the most advantages to the government, cost or price and the other non-cost or non-price factors listed. In determining which quotation offers the greatest value or advantage to the Government, overall technical merit will be considered more important than price or cost. The degree of importance of price or cost as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality in the technical merits of the quotations. Between acceptable quotations with a significant difference in technical merit, a determination will be made as to whether the additional technical merit or benefits reflected by a higher priced quotation warrants payment of the additional price or cost.
The Contracting Officer is the only person who can legally obligate the Government for the expenditure of public funds. Costs shall not be incurred by recipients of this solicitation in anticipation of receiving direct reimbursement from the Government. It is understood that your offer will become part of the official file on this matter without obligation to the Government.

Electronic Transmission of Offers. Offers may only be transmitted via FedConnect, www.fedconnect.net, or via email to Don Downey, ddowney@usgs.gov . Offers shall consist of two volumes: Volume One shall be non-price (technical) evaluation support documentation, Volume Two shall be Price Quotes.

Questions/Inquiries shall be sent electronically to Don Downey, ddowney@usgs.gov. Questions received within the last five (5) days before this solicitation closes/ends will be considered untimely and may not receive a response.
This solicitation closes/ends 12/01/2014 at 1700 ET. All offers shall be received in their entirety by 12/01/2014 at 1700 ET.

In the original instructions, those wanting to view the bidder's library were directed to log onto https://icbm.topvue.com/topvue-icbm/ and request an account linked to the RFSE folder. Please do not request access this way. These requests cannot be answered. Instead, complete the attached account request form (see attachments) and submit it to Peggy Japngie Lizotte at peggy.japngie_lizotte.1@us.af.mil. Subsequently, you will receive an email with a user id, password, and instructions on how to configure the account.

<p><em><strong>Interested parties are advised that notices and information about the RFSE program were previously placed on FBO under the number FA8214-14-R-9000. Due to numbering requirements, this number has changed to FA8214-15-R-0001. Interested parties may want to update their notices on FBO.</strong></em></p>
<p>The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Contracting Division, Hill Air Force Base, UT intends to issue a solicitation for Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE) Production effort. The RFSE is a nuclear-certified test set. It is comprised of radio frequency, electrical, and structural hardware (including through-hole soldered multi-layer boards) which is integrated with government-provided, existing, non-commercial software. Under the RFSE production effort, the contractor will:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A - produce and deliver up to seven RFSE suites, up to four sets of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; support equipment, and initial spares in accordance with the applicable <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; standards and government-provided drawings;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B - provide interim contractor support for all RFSE units;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C - train users on how to operate, test, maintain, troubleshoot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;problems,&nbsp;and do field-level repairs the RFSE.<br />Contractors must have the ability to perform design requalification and recertification if circumstances necessitate a change in the nuclear-certified design of the RFSE-such a change would require nuclear surety and nuclear safety experience. Due to the nuclear-certified design, contractors must have a well-defined and detailed manufacturing plan (including environmental controls), stringent configuration control, and a high degree of quality assurance.</p>
<p>Delivery of the first RFSE unit will be made no later than 20 months after contract award, and all RFSE units and support equipment must be delivered no later than 44 months after contract award.</p>
<p>The solicitation will result in issuance of a Definitive Contract with multiple options. Draft parts of the solicitation critical to an offeror's understanding of the requirement have been released on FBO under the number FA8214-14-R-9000. This included Section L, Section M, and the model contract (with Contract Line Item Numbering Structure). Interested parties who seek more information on this acquisition (including but not limited to quantity, unit of issue, and destination information) are advised to review that draft release. The draft will be updated upon solicitation release, and offerors are required to review the solicitation for any updates.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a full and open competition (not a small business set aside), using the lowest price, technically acceptable source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection and the Department of Defense (DoD) Source Selection Procedures (effective 1 July 2011) as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), and the Air Force Source Selection Mandatory Procedures (MP5315.3). A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 15 December 2014 on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO).</p>
<p>The solicitation (except the technical data package-see below) will be released on FBO. Paper copies of the solicitation (except technical orders-see below) will not be mailed. Interested offerors are responsible for checking FBO to obtain the solicitation and any amendments or other information pertaining to the solicitation and are encouraged to register for notification through FBO.</p>
<p>While the solicitation will be placed on FBO, the technical data package (TDP) will not. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application, and the TDP contains <strong>export controlled data</strong>. As such, the only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. Those that are certified and registered will have a DD Form 2345 certified by the Joint Certification Program. For those contractors that do not have a certified DD Form 2345, but would like to participate in this acquisition, the form, including instructions for completing the form, is available at</p>
<p>http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/forminfo/forminfopage2220.html.</p>
<p>Interested parties are advised that approval of a DD2345 may take time, so completion and submission of that form now rather than upon or after release of the solicitation is highly recommended.</p>
<p>To obtain a copy of the TDP, offerors must request the TDP from the contracting officer listed in the below point of contact section. The request must include a copy of the offeror's current, approved DD Form 2345. Once an offeror's DD Form 2345 is verified, access to the drawings, specifications, and other program documents through the software program, TopVue, will be provided to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345. After approval of the controlling office, technical orders will be provided to the data custodian by mail.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foreign participation at the prime contractor level is not permitted</span>. All offerors must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov) to be eligible for award. In addition, offerors must ensure their Annual Representations and Certifications are updated and current.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought is issued solely to gather information for planning and market research purposes. This is not a request for proposals; and therefore the Government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice. All information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter. Proprietary information should be clearly marked, and respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information furnished must comply with the Security Exchange Commission's confidential treatment regulations at 17 C.F.R. 200.83. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review of the information provided, but may be contacted for additional information for clarification.  <br>    <br>  The Government intends to solicit and award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract for these requirements. The anticipated contract period of performance is June 2015 through June 2018.  <br>    <br>  The Auxiliary Power Unit System consists of an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), accessories, controls, a monitoring system, and a starting system.  The system provides pneumatic power for main engine starting and cabin heating, electrical and hydraulic power for ground operations and in-flight emergency electrical power.  A hydraulic accumulator provides the hydraulic pressure used to drive the APU starter mounted on the APU.  Once the APU is operating, the AC Generator mounted on the APU provides electrical power to the helicopter's electrical system.  <br>    <br>  The APU is a small single-shaft, constant speed gas-turbine engine.  The APU consists of a gas turbine shaft power section, a reduction gear drive, and appropriate controls and accessories. The accessory gear drive provides 12,000 rpm output drive for the APU AC Generator providing the helicopter with 115 Volts alternating current (V ac), three phase, 400 hertz electrical power.  The accessory gearbox is mounted on top of the reduction drive assembly, and provides the mount for the hydraulic starter, fuel pump, and accelerator.  The APU start motor is mounted to the accessory gearbox, is hydraulically driven, and motors the compressor assembly during the start sequence.  The APU performs self-starting for the aircraft to -25 degrees F.  The APU is required to make consistent successful main engine starts within the operational envelopes of the T700-GE-701D Turbo-Shaft Aircraft Engine to a maximum altitude of 17,000 feet.  When the APU reaches 70%, the start motor drops out and becomes a freewheeling unit.  The APU has a self-contained Oil System using MIL-L-23699 or MIL-L-7808 oils. The capacity is 3 US quarts, checked by using a dipstick. The APU consumes approximately 120 pounds of fuel per hour provided by aircraft main fuel system.  JP4, JP5, JP8 and commercial jet fuels may be used.  <br>    <br>  The delivery configuration of the APU shall be UH-60 qualified and shall contain a UH-60 qualified Inlet Barrier Filter (IBF) System.  The APU with IBF system for the H-60 series aircraft is designed to minimize the impact on the APU and airframe and is optimized for maximum flow characteristics.    The barrier system employs high separation filter material with greater than 99% efficiency on both AC Coarse and AC fine test dust.  The high efficiency allows the IBF equipped APU to reach established time between overhauls (TBOs) without internal damage to the bleed driven components or erosion damage to the diffuser and rotating components.  The system requires maximum maintainability with quick and easy servicing, replaceable and reusable barrier filter assemblers (15 cleaning cycles) and on-condition cleaning based on an integral filter maintenance indicator.  The barrier filter system shall be Army qualified to include performance/operability testing, system vibration testing, and altitude start evaluation.  <br>    <br>  The Government does NOT own a technical data package for this effort.  <br>    <br>  Sources Sought Requirements - Description of Information Requested  <br>    <br>  1.	Provide company information including:  <br>  a.	Company name and address.  <br>  b.	Size of company (number of personnel, total revenue, ownership, CAGE Code, Parent Corporation, etc.).  <br>  c.

Provide evidence that the offerors APU with IBF is qualified on the H-60 aircraft.  This can either be a complete collection of qualification test and analysis data, or a signed statement of airworthiness from the Army Aviation Engineering Directorate.  <br>  3.	Provide any other pertinent information that will assist us in this assessment.  <br>  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from industry vendors regarding their interest, capabilities, and recommendations in developing proposals for the UHPO, Program Executive Office, Aviation (PEO Aviation). Include whether or not you are a small business; HUB-Zone Small Business; Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses; Women-Owned Small Business; or Small Disadvantaged Business in order to assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  <br>    <br>  All interested firms with capabilities identified herein are encouraged to respond to this Sources Sought, by Technical questions, data requests and industry responses to this Sources Sought are to be sent email to Oscar Dothard at oscar.o.dothard.civ@mail.mil, CCAM-BHC, 256-842-7509.

1.	Which is deemed eligible; 2.	Which is deemed responsible; 3.	Whose proposal conforms to the solicitation?s requirements; and 4.	Whose proposal is determined to provide the best value to the Government.  
The proposal offering the best value is the one that is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Such an offer may not necessarily be the one offering the lowest price or receiving the highest non-price rating.
For this solicitation, all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Award will not be automatically determined by numerical calculation or formula relationship between the non-price factors and price.  As non-price factors, when combined, become more equal, the evaluated price rises in importance and may become the determining factor.
The Contracting Officer will determine what trade-off between the non-price factors and price promises the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. <BR> <BR>The Government intends to make award without discussions on the basis of initial proposals received.  However, the Government may elect to make award with discussions if it is determined to be in the Government?s best interest.
If the Government elects to make award with discussions, it reserves the right, before requesting a final proposal revision, to:
1.	Limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals;
2.	Make more than one competitive range determination;
3.	Conduct more than one round of discussions; and
4.	Conduct more than one round of proposal revisions. <BR> <BR>Factor 1:  	Management Approach. Factor 2:  	WORK PLAN/STAFFING Factor 3:       PAST PERFORMANCE
See attached SOW for additional information. <BR> <BR>The government will evaluated the contractors price build up for each labor category described in Section B to include all cost elements ,  (i.e., base labor rated, fringe, G&A, overhead, profit  etc.) to determine that price is fair and reasonable. <BR> <BR>The Government will evaluate offers for contract award purposes by adding the total proposed price for all option periods to the total proposed price for the base periods in Section 8.  ? <BR> <BR>The estimated completion date for this task order is 180 days after date of award. <BR> <BR>Questions are due at 12:00EST on Friday, November 21, 2014; and must be submitted the FedBid Q&A portal in order to be considered. Answers will be posted. <BR> <BR>NAICS Code: 541990 <BR> <BR>

<DESC>1. The labor categories seem to have a significant experience requirement. Would the government consider adding some labor categories with less experience to the existing LCAT descriptions? 

Please include suggested LCAT requirements in your sources sought response. 

2. Given the expected size and scope of the task orders, will the period of performance (PoP) for awarded task orders be able to pass the PoP of the IDIQ?

It is possible that orders will exceed the PoP of the IDIQ ordering period. Typically, orders are not expected to exceed the ordering period by more than 12 months. For example, it is possible that a 12 month task order may be issued on the last day of the ordering period.
 

3. Are cover pages part of the 10 page limit on the sources sought? 

No.

4.what is the anticipated performance durations by task orders. Will some be across the five year PoP and some short term/duration? 

The government anticipates orders will be for various lengths dependent on the requirement. 

5. Will the solicitation have a Royal Saudi Navy component?

The Royal Saudi Navy is a BSC customer; however, the BSC currently does not have a near term requirement to support them. 

6. Are multiple contracts being rolled up?

No.

7. Will Navy and DoD past performances be given greater relevancy than those from commercial entities?

Relevancy will be evaluated based on the similarity of the scope, complexity, and magnitude as compared to the PWS.
 

8. How many awards and/or overall percentage of the funds of this vehicle are currently earmarked for small business? 

To date, the number of awards has not been established nor have any amounts been set aside or earmarked for small businesses. 

9. Who is the incumbent? 

The current MAC is held by IBM, Accenture, and Deloitte. 

10. Should large businesses respond to the sources sought?

Yes. While potential vendors are not required to respond to the sources sought, the Government encourages large and small businesses to respond to the sources sought. In addition to providing a capability statement, the Government requests vendors submit comments, questions, and suggestions regarding the requirement.
 

11. Is the intent to replace the current ERP Sustainment IDIQ with this new broader IDIQ?

The new IDIQ is considered a follow on to the existing contract. 

12. Will evaluation of personnel be part of the solicitation criteria (sections L  and  M)?

Evaluation of personnel is not currently included in the tentative source selection. 

13. Is it possible that new programs like EPS will fall under this procurement?

Yes.

14. The IDIQ appears to include best value and LPTA. Can you share the strategy around how each will be applied to future task orders? 

A determination to use trade off or LPTA will be dependent on each task order competition. The Government anticipates that both best value determinations will be used during task order competitions.

15.
 Draft labor categories appear to contain higher education and experience requirements than the current MAC IDIQ. How will that be handled relative to trip wires? 

Tripwires will be discussed with NAVSUP leadership during the approval process. 

16. What business process initiatives are already underway?

Two examples include Financial Services Process (Business process standardization) and Warehouse Management Process. 

17. How are you aligning business process designs with OSD (DCMO  and  SECDEF Comptroller)?

Through business enterprise architecture. 

18. Since the PWS looks very similar to the existing IDIQ contract, what is the Government looking to change under a new contract? 

While the scope is similar, the magnitude of this requirement is larger.
 

19. What data management initiatives are already underway? 

Data linkage and traceability for audit.  

20. How are you aligning with OSD data management initiatives?

Data architecture as depicted in Department of Defense Architectural Framework (DoDAF v 2.0).

21. The technical presentation was about new approaches to existing challenges. Is BSC interested in bringing a much broader base of talent to respond to the challenges?  

Yes.

22. You have a lot of existing efforts. Are you looking to extend those efforts or re-evaluate those efforts and consider new approaches?

BSC Is considering all options to better support its customers. 

23. Will you move the work to the capability or move the capability to the work? Remote deployment? 

BSC is flexible on approaches, depending on customer requirements.

24.
 Is there a tool or a set of tools that will be used to establish the metadata repository or/and data dictionary?

Currently there are multiple with the possibility of consolidating meta-data repository systems. 

25. How will these areas of support (data management, business process, etc.) be broken out via the task orders?

Task order requirements depend on customer needs and existing BSC capability. 

26. Do you anticipate keeping the model of dividing the work via functional capabilities in the system?

BSC has not made a determination on the division of work at this time.

27. Is there a security clearance requirement?

Not at this time. Should a clearance be required at the task order level it will be identified in the task PWS.
 

28. Identification/information on:
- Types of systems 
- Hardware (servers, storage)
- Software (o/s, 3rd party software, SAP, SAS)
- Databases (types, oracle, sybase, DB2, sizes)

BSC plans to publish a tech spec package for the IDIQ and task order competitions which will include this information. 

29. With all of the data being assessed, analyzed, business decisions  being made, where is the cyber security wrapper around this to protect yourself? 

All solutions must be maintained IAW Navy and DoD Cyber Security Policies.

30. Can you expand a little further on the training and communications services identified in the original PWS?

This requirement is dependent on specific customer requirement and is usually applied with a specific IT System user community.
 

31. What is the relationship between PEO, SPAWAR, and BSC?

PEO and SPAWAR are customers of BSC. SPAWAR is also a delivery partner in some projects. 

32. A common issue in the user community is lack of awareness of available tools. Is there any effort to make communication with the end user community a priority, particularly with respect to tools and training that is available? 

Yes, as required by customer requirements and the user community. 

33. Will the IDIQ be awarded on an all or nothing approach? 

The Government hasnt made a final determination on this yet. 

34. Will you use Seaport-E?

At this time, it is FLC Norfolk/BSCs intent to award its own IDIQ and not use any existing MAC.
 

35. How many awards? 

The number of awards has not been established yet. 

36. How big is the magnitude? How much larger than the existing contract? 

BSC underestimated the aggressive growth of Navy Audit. Additional growth to the requirement was the result of new customers after NAVSISA became BSC. 

37. A number of commands do not currently use Navy ERP. Will future work include bringing those commands on ERP? 

Yes. 

38. How close are we to getting to a clean audit? What is the plan?

Generally speaking IT is not a primary component of the audit. BSC is currently delivering 250 changes to ERP to contribute to a clean audit.

<DESC>The original Request for Information (RFI) was posted on September 4, 2014. SSA's plans have changed with regard to this potential procurement. It is now anticipated that the need for offsite vaulting services will continue for only one year (a base period), with the possibility of one additional year (an option period) at a substantially reduced level. It is also anticipated that the quantities identified previously (i.e., 1400 tapes daily/Urbana, 688 tapes daily /North Carolina, and 30 tapes daily/Baltimore) will be reduced although it is not known at this time by how much. <br /><br />SSA is seeking to identify vendors that would be 1) interested in responding to this potential procurement and 2)&nbsp;capable of providing the anticipated required services. <br /><br />If you have already responded to this RFI, please respond again indicating if you would still be interested given the anticipated changes. If you did not respond to the previous RFI, please refer to the original notice for questions and required information. <br /><br />Pricing data is not required.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Indian Health Service (IHS) develops and supports a comprehensive integrated health information system of systems which supports a broad range of clinical and business functions at IHS, Tribal and Urban (I/T/U) hospitals and clinics across the country. The Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) is similar to the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) in use at the Veterans Administration, having been derived from the same legacy system and sharing many of the same infrastructure and business applications. The RPMS as currently deployed has a MUMPS (Intersystems Cache) database architecture and VA FileMan file structures. A number of graphical user interface (GUI) applications utilizing various languages ranging from Delphi to C# .NET have been developed to support certain business processes, while other applications retain legacy character-based interfaces. RPMS GUI applications principally use a two-tiered architecture utilizing broker-based remote procedure calls, although recent development has focused on a three-tier architecture using web services. For more information on the portfolio of supported applications, visit: http://www.ihs.gov/RPMS/ <br />Business functions supported by the RPMS include, but are not limited to, practice management (e.g. patient registration, scheduling, billing and accounts receivable, release of information), ancillary clinical applications (e.g. inpatient and outpatient pharmacy, laboratory, radiology, image archiving, consults and referrals), and point of care clinical applications for behavioral health, inpatient and ambulatory care. The RPMS is certified as a Complete Electronic Health Record for inpatient and ambulatory settings according to the 2014 version certification criteria published by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. In recent years, the system has been extended to include a personal health record system, Direct secure messaging, a health information exchange (HIE) service, and supporting middleware services. In recent years the architecture and complexity of IHS health IT systems as well as their criticality to health care operations have become an impetus for IHS to re-evaluate its current approach to software development.<br />This Sources Sought Notice seeks to identify companies that have capability to provide full lifecycle software development, architecture, and operations support services to assist IHS with evolving the RPMS, as well as the software lifecycle programs and processes around the system, to align with current best practices in application architecture, design and management. The IHS strategy includes improvements in data modeling and mapping, transition to a true service-oriented architecture (SOA), and harmonization of disparate GUIs into a common interface framework compliant with accessibility and usability best practices in a platform-independent context (i.e. support for Web, mobile, machine, and other ancillary interfaces). IHS also seeks to continuously mature its governance model, project and portfolio management, system development life cycle, security integration, and software quality assurance processes.<br />While IHS is not specifying a specific SDLC, understanding the capabilities of an organization's proven methodology is critical. IHS is particularly interested in identifying sources that have successfully implemented and adopted a methodology that is akin to the Scaled Agile&reg; Framework or the Enterprise Unified Process. The reason for interest in this type of methodology is the need to support iterative development practices in a large, regulated, federal, health care environment.<br />The projected scope of this requirement is estimated to reach $125 million over (5) years. Interested small businesses, with a high level of expertise and demonstrable past performance compatible with the IHS objectives described above are invited to submit capability statements.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR HQ), in support of the Naval Sea Systems Command, Program Executive Office, Submarines, Maritime Surveillance Systems Program Office, PMS 485, intends to issue a Full and Open Competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) for the development of Shallow Water Surveillance System (SWSS) passive acoustic linear arrays. Based on market research, the Government determined that there were no small businesses capable of producing the required arrays within the required time frame.
The SWSS arrays are surveillance sensors used as the primary sensing capability for SWSS units which are physically attached to the arrays.  Each SWSS unit is a stand-alone, battery powered system which will collect, process, analyze the data from the array and transmit undersea contact locating information to operational commanders.  They are designed to support the Navy's littoral undersea surveillance needs in detecting and reporting submarines.  Each SWSS array comprises the following sub-assemblies: one acoustic array (to include its leader cable and terminating connector); one array interface card (physically located inside the SWSS node bottle which includes its necessary connectors and bulkhead connector), and one array dispenser.
The proposed contract will be a single award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with an ordering period of five years that will allow for the development and production of a maximum of 75 SWSS passive acoustic linear arrays.  The development and production effort will be procured on a Firm- Fixed-Price (FFP) basis.
A Sources Sought, SPAWAR Headquarters MKTSVY F1ADA dated 24 June 2014, was issued for market research purposes to determine the interest and capability of Small Business to participate in this acquisition.  Of the four responses to the Sources Sought, three were from small businesses and one was from a non-profit organization.  The Government's analysis of the Sources Sought responses indicated that none of the four were capable of producing the required arrays within the required time frame.  Therefore, it was recommended that the SWSS Array RFP be issued as a Full and Open Competitive solicitation.  The SPAWAR Small Business Office and the Small Business Administration Representative reviewed the Sources Sought analysis and concurred with the decision not to set-aside this effort.
Responses to this announcement should be addressed to James Leal at James.Leal@navy.mil. Companies interested in this RFP should monitor the FedBizOpps.com website for the release of this solicitation.
*********************UPDATE 11-17-14************************* Posted all questions & answers received to date regarding this pre-solicitation synopsis (see attachment). Also, updated the projected bid due date until 1/30/15 (this is just an estimate).

*********************UPDATE 11-20-14************************* Changed the proposed contract from "a five (5) year effort (base year with four (4) option years)" to "a single award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with an ordering period of five years".

<DESC>VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for complete design services (preliminary concepts and layouts, program development, investigative services, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, cost estimating services, and construction period services)  to  Build a  NEW Emergency Room Department  at Albany Medical Center ,  Project# 528A8-15-809. 
This is a 100% total service disabled veteran owned small business set aside. 
This contract includes design and construction period services for a new maximum 13,300 gross square foot addition to the main hospital at grade level. The new addition will contain an approximately 9800 net square foot new Emergency Department, with a connecting corridor back to the main hospital core.   Includes 14 specialty treatment rooms, dedicated x-ray, dedicated CT, pneumatic transport system,  
   
For any proposed connection to existing utility systems, the A/E shall analyze the existing utility systems to verify there are sufficient resources to supply the new addition. 

The project will include site renovations to provide separate entrances and routing for ambulance arrivals and walk-in patients. The design shall follow the VA Physical Security manual requirements for mission-critical facilities. 

A design was completed for this project in 2012, but the footprint must be reduced and the engineering redone to meet approved limits. This design contract shall use this design as a starting point; all design documents will be shared after contract award. 

Detailed cost estimates performed by a professional cost estimator are required at each design stage in order to ensure the final design estimate does not exceed the funding limit.

Services shall include, multi-disciplinary investigative services, initial conceptual drawings, attending required design/review meetings, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, cost estimating services, and construction period services which shall include final punch list compilation and as-built drawings. Deliverables being provided to the VA will include initial conceptual drawings, 35%, 65%, 95%, and 100% drawings and specifications for review and approval, and 100% construction documents provided in multiple sized copies. 
The intent is for the design to occur during FY2015 with construction in late FY2015 or early FY2016.
The following evaluation factors will be used when reviewing submitted SF 330 data and will comprise the basis of information to be used by VAMC Syracuse for A/E evaluation and selection. The evaluation factors are shown below in descending order of importance (highest importance at the top). 
Firms responding are strongly urged to include information following the exact format requested in the SF330.

<DESC><p>The United States Coast Guard is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement for an&nbsp;appointment scheduling system that allows mariners across the world to schedule appointments at a Regional Examination Center (REC). The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541519.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The United States Coast Guard (USCG) National Maritime Center (NMC) manages a Mariner Credentialing Program (MCP). As part of the credentialing process, mariners are required to submit applications to the NMC and complete an examination at a Regional Examination Center (REC). The USCG has 20 REC across the United States where mariners can go to submit an application and complete the required examinations. The USCG NMC requires an appointment schedule system that allows mariners across the world to schedule appointments at a REC. Historically, the USCG has purchased StormSource software to fulfill this requirement as a sole source requirement on an annual basis. The Coast Guard is proposing to set up a contract with a 12-month base and four one year option periods. The purpose of this market research is to determine if a continued sole source to StormSource is justified, or if other applications are available to meet the USCG's needs.</p>
<p>The USCG is requesting that interested companies provide a brief capability/information statement demonstrating the ability to fulfill the otfollowing requirements:</p>
<p>1. Provide web based system access to mariners and USCG users 24/7, 365 days a year from any location worldwide. Access types are the levels of system access assigned to each user who can log in to the system. The login must define what account features they can use. Provide the ability for mariners both internal and external customers to schedule appointments at any of the 20 REC locations in a single application.</p>
<p>2. Provide mariners the ability to schedule appointments for two types services: (1) appointments with a REC for filling out an application and (2) appointments with a REC for taking examinations</p>
<p><br />3. Provide mariners the ability to view a calendar to determine open day/time slots of all RECs that will best fit their schedule.</p>
