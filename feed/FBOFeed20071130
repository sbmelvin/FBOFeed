<DESC>Title:  Aviation Weather Human Factors Market Survey Name:  Tanyka L. Lawrence 			 Organization:  AJT-48 		  Region:  FAA Headquarters 			  Phone Number: 202-267-7802		  E-Mail:  Tanyka.L.Lawrence@faa.gov 			  Date:  November 9, 2007 Archiving date:  November 26, 2007		  Posting ID:  			  Phase: 			  Procurement Method:  Market Survey  Posting (brief abstract):  This is a market survey for Human Factors Research and Engineering Group.  This advertisement is posted in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management Policy 3.2.1  The Next Generation Air Transportation System concept of operations calls for the expanded use of aviation weather information for all NextGen stakeholders including air traffic service providers, flight crews, airline operations centers and dispatchers. The importance of enhanced weather data is highlighted by the fact that 65% of NAS delays are weather-related (2007, Bureau of Transportation Statistics). With regards to aviation safety, the 2006 Nall report (2006, AOPA Air Safety Foundation) states that general aviation weather accidents accounted for 4.6% percent of total accidents but 13.6% of fatal accidents.  Improvements in decision making, aviation weather information integration, display, and data use are needed to assist in reducing weather delays, accidents and incidents. For example, in today's aviation operations, there is a proliferation of weather data that is not well integrated into existing decision support systems.  The FAA is seeking to better understand industry, academia, and government capabilities in the area of aviation weather human factors to inform R&D investments in the areas of: ýýý	Understanding current aviation weather decision making by individuals and teams ýýý	Determining aviation weather information needs for multiple stakeholders (e.g. air traffic control, flight deck, dispatch, traffic flow management) ýýý	Aviation weather-related decision making for air traffic controllers, traffic flow managers, pilots, and airline personnel ýýý	Integration of aviation weather information for decision-centric design of displays, procedures and automation ýýý	Use of aviation weather information to support trajectory-based operations decision-making ýýý	Measurement of the impact of enhanced aviation weather information on human performance, aviation operations, and safety.  ýýý	Current and future selection and  training challenges for weather decision-making ýýý	Current and future R&D challenges to certification and flight standards Interested parties are requested to submit the following information: ýýý	Demonstrated technical experience and knowledgeable personnel in the areas of human factors, aviation weather, and/or air traffic / flight deck operations and technologies ýýý	Methods for determining user information needs applied to aviation weather ýýý	Methods for understanding, assessing, and measuring decision making with an application to aviation weather ýýý	Demonstrated simulation experience related to air traffic control, flight deck or related displays and procedures ýýý	Technical comments (i.e. other aviation weather human factors R&D areas respondents consider critical, etc)  The FAA encourages interested organizations to partner where needed to address the above topic areas. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this market survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense.  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this is effort is 541990, with a size standard of $6.5 million. Responses may be submitted by email to Tanyka.L.Lawrence@faa.gov.  If sent electronically, it is preferred that the response be sent as an attachment to the email message in Microsoft Word, PDF or similar format, on company letterhead and print to no more than 8 pages including graphics and appendices, on 8 ýý x11 paper size and using 12 point font.   Responses containing marketing materials are not desired and may be discarded without review.  One, some, all, or none of the respondents to the Market Survey may be requested to provide additional information at the option of the Government. No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise for future FAA business.   Information obtained will be used to support the development of an acquisition strategy for aviation weather human factors research and development. Interested parties should reply via email, by close of business December 14, 2007 to Tanyka.L.Lawrence@faa.gov.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals.  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source bridge contract with Covenant Homeland Security Solution, Ltd, while the follow-on competitive acquisition and transition is completed.  The follow-on competitive acquisition began with a Sources Sought Notice (DE-RI01-06SA00001) which was issued on July 25, 2006. This Sources Sought Notice requested capability statements from qualified small businesses for the ýýýOffice of Health, Safety and Security (HSS) Protective Force services in the National Capital Area for DOEýýý.  Subsequent to the July 25, 2006 market research, extended market research was conducted in February 2007.  Upon completion of extended market research, the acquisition strategy was finalized and the Acquisition Plan was approved on August 10, 2007. A Request for Proposals (RFP) for the follow-on acquisition is anticipated for release in the late December, 2007/early 2008 timeframe.  At this time, the follow-on acquisition approach contemplates release of the Request for Proposals as a total small business set-aside. The proposed bridge contract will provide continued high quality Protective Force services to HSS. This support is currently being performed by Covenant Homeland Security Solution, Ltd under contract number DE-AC01-05SO20222 and will expire on January 31, 2008.  HSS is responsible for the development, promulgation, and evaluation of security programs, and the oversight of safeguards and security; cyber security; emergency management; and environment, safety, and health programs throughout the Department.  Within HSS is the Office of Headquarters Security Operations (HS-1.31), which provides protection of the Departmentýýýs facilities in the National Capital Area, the health and safety of assigned personnel, and the classified, sensitive, and unclassified property and matter in those facilities, and ensures the continuity of government (COG) in all circumstances mandated by Presidential Decision Directives.  Protection and physical access control is provided 24 hours a day, 365 days a year at the Forrestal building and satellite facilities in Washington, DC, the Germantown facility and satellite facilities in Germantown, Maryland.  The Performance Work Statement (PWS), Position Qualifications, and estimated level of effort for this Covenant Homeland Security Services, Ltd contract are provided on the Departmentýýýs Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at: http://e-center.doe.gov/. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this contract is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 USC 2304[c][1], and implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyýýýs requirements.  Covenant Homeland Security Services has the requisite number of key and non-key personnel possessing the required security clearances, technical skill and training, who are familiar with the program and requirements, and who are available to provide services pending the award of a competitive follow-on contract. In addition, all personnel are required to have DOE ýýýQýýý level security clearances to perform work under this contract. Based on current experience, it takes at least 6 months and possibly as long as a year for the clearance approval process to be completed. There are approximately 200 individuals working on the existing contract.  If this bridge contract does not get approved, not only would there be a significant delay due to the time required to conduct a competitive procurement, but there would be additional delays in order for individuals to acquire the appropriate security clearances.  Covenant Homeland Security Service staff has the requisite knowledge and experience and required security clearances, and can proceed without interruption.  Firms who want to be considered for the short term sole-source requirement must submit an interest letter that demonstrates: 1) the firm's ability to perform the work as described in the current contract Statement of Work provided at the DOE IIPS website referenced above; and 2) the firmýýýs ability to provide the requisite personnel with the appropriate DOE ýýýQýýý level security clearances to perform work commencing February 1, 2008. Interested parties may submit its rationale as to why they should be considered within thirty (30) days of this notice to the DOE IIPS website  If a determination is subsequently made by the Government to compete for these services (planned to be provided under this bridge contract by Covenant Homeland Security Service), a competition will be conducted for the three 3-month option periods.  It would not be possible to conduct this competition for the initial 3-month period, and as described above, it is unacceptable to have a break in service for this work.  Thus, the bridge contract would continue during the entire 3-month initial period while the competition is being held for the available option period(s) needed until the competitive acquisition under DE-RP01-08HS08024 is completed.  A determination by the Government not to proceed with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The intent of this award is to provide the required Protective Force services until the award and transition of a competitive follow-on acquisition is completed as described in the first paragraph above.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 561612. The period of performance of this bridge contract is for a total of nine months, consisting of an initial 3-month period and two 3-month option periods. ***See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services related to the modernization and renovation at the Minton-Capehart Federal Building, located in downtown Indianapolis at 575 North Pennsylvania, Indiana.  Built in 1974, the Minton-Capehart Federal Building is a freestanding six story building with a Ground Floor below grade, with a mechanical mezzanine above grade, and a penthouse above the core area of the Sixth Floor.  Attached to the building is a two level parking facility.  It is the intention in this design and construction renovation project is to respect the Modern Era "Brutalist" Design of the building, even though the building is not yet currently listed on the National Historic Register. The estimated total construction cost for the project is over $10,000,000.00, with an anticipated Construction Phase duration of approximately 24 months.

The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes: (1) Preconstruction Phase Services through Design Concepts (Base Contract), (2) Preconstruction Phase Services through Design Development (Option One), (3) Preconstruction Phase Services through the Construction Document Phase (Option Two), and (4) Construction Phase Services (Option Three).

The Government intends to evaluate price proposals according to the CMc's cost of Pre-Construction Phase Services (Base contract, Option 1, and Option 2) and Construction Phase Services (Option 3).  

Pre-Construction Phase services (Base contract, Option 1, Option 2) will be funded through FY2006 appropriated design funds and anticipated FY2010 design funds.  Construction Phase Services (Option 3) will be funded through anticipated FY2011 construction funds.

The Government contemplates pricing for the Construction Phase Services, Option 3, to be broken down for evaluation purposes, into prices corresponding to: Construction Phase Construction Management Services, Estimated Direct General Conditions, Cost Available to Fund Construction, Profit, Overhead, Daily Delay Rate, and Subcontractor Commission.  It is anticipated that a firm, fixed price based upon the general construction services required will be negotiated prior to exercising the Construction Phase Option.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using the federal acquisition regulations, Source Selection Procedures (FAR 15.3), and the "Best Value Trade-off" process.   For this procurement, technical factors when combined are more important than price.  All elements of the work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitation budget. 

Project Summary:

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, this project will be executed based on GSA's Design and Construction Excellence Program.  The scope of this project, as it relates to the planned modernization and renovation work will most likely included, but not be limited to, the following:  (1) Replacement of the air-handling units for greater airflow to provide the recommended minimum amount of fresh air for each occupant and improve total air circulation, (2) Replacement of the fiberglass branch distribution ductwork and diffusers to handle greater airflows and to eliminate contamination from glass fibers in the conditioned air, (3) Replacement of the stair pressurization fans with larger fans to produce the necessary pressures and airflows in order to meet current life safety code standards, (4) Provide a new Direct Digital Control (DDC) temperature control system for energy efficiency, (5) Provide additional commissioning of the system and other improvements for LEED Certification, (6) Provide a new voice fire alarm system, required by building code, (7) Provide a new fire pump and jockey pump, installed in the Ground Floor mechanical room, to boost the pressure for the sprinkler system, (8) Use the four existing dry standpipe risers in the stairs as a part of the new system (two of the risers will feed the new distribution system), (9) Provide new lay-in ceilings, repair hard ceilings and replace lighting throughout the building with modular wiring and automatic controls for lower maintenance costs, easier adds and moves, as well as provide greater energy efficiency, (10) Replacement of the existing emergency generator with a larger unit to serve the fire pumps, (11) Provide each floor with two sprinkler mains that will be connected to a separate riser.  Sprinkler protection will be extended from the mains to each space in the building.  The existing sprinkler systems will be tied to the new system and (12) Upgrade building electrical components as necessary to support the scope items mentioned above.

The project will incorporate GSA's design standards for secure facilities, conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements. 

The building will be fully occupied during construction.  All building systems will remain in operation during construction and the project phased to avoid disruption of occupants.  Construction will be accomplished after normal business hours (6pm-6am, weekends, and holidays).  It is not anticipated that on-site swing space will be available for use on this project.

<DESC>It is the intent of the Government to award the following scope of work to Maine Geological Survey 22 State House Station Agusta Me.
The purpose of this task is to provide hazard risk analysis and additional technical assistance that will assist the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with the local, regional, state, and federal agencies dealing with existing and increased flood hazards caused by the April 15-18 2007 Patriots Day Nor?easter. The analysis will be used to help the State of Maine during recovery and mitigation efforts.
. The southern and central counties in Maine are subject to heavy development pressures. Having a guide to the possible locations of landslides could help prevent unsafe construction of buildings in locations where the combination of soils and slope will lead to slope failure. This will lessen the likelihood of damage to property and help prevent loss of lives.
The objective of the task is to continue the process of conducting detailed landslide site mapping and the preparation of landslide susceptibility maps for communities under strong development pressure. Mapping produced under this task will help community and state officials identify locations within York County where a landslide might occur. The deliverables from the task to be performed under this scope of work will provide guidance for developers and land use regulators in determining when additional studies should be done before undertaking construction or other activities that could be at risk due to a landslide.

Additionally this task will assist the state in developing a systematic process to collect information on the losses associated with historic landslides in Maine. This database is necessary to provide necessary background data for use in the setting of policies directed at coping with the issues of construction practices in possibly unstable ground areas. Loss data will assist government agencies identify trends and track progress in reducing losses from landslides.
The focus area for this data collection and mapping effort consists of communities that have not yet been studied and mapped for landslide susceptibility in York County, Maine. A study for the Town of Wells has been completed. For this task, other communities in the county will be chosen by the Maine Geological Survey based on known development pressures, knowledge of landslides that have occurred but have not yet been accounted for by the state, and the types of soils (the largest proportion of landslides in Maine occur on clay and mixed soil materials) located in communities within the glacial marine Presumpscot Formation (a geologic deposit that has been shown to be susceptible to landslides and other mass movements). 
Utilize the available geologic mapping for York County as the base for the landslide mapping. Data from this Geographic Information System (GIS) based mapping will be complemented with field data obtained over approximately a six month period during the mid-spring to mid-fall. Factors such as ground slope, slope aspect, relief, slope curvature, and types of surficial material will be gathered as part of the effort to conduct detailed landslide site mapping in the county.

As various landslide risk factor databases are developed from the field work, analytical work will progress to develop the deliverable for this task, a landslide susceptibility map for York County. Another outcome for the task to be performed under this scope of work will be sensitivity analyses of the various types of data (factors) collected to determine how they relate to a more accurate delineation of landslide susceptible areas.

A report describing the results of the sensitivity analyses of the various factors in predicting where landslide will occur, the results of the analytical effort on the data and the methodologies used in the field work and generation of the landslide susceptibility maps will be prepared.

All data and finished products developed under this task will be available to the general public for free or for only a nominal fee.  
 
Item 3 ? Printing and Distribution of Maps and Report to Communities:

Landslide susceptibility maps, accompanied by the report, will be delivered to community officials through community visits by contractor staff. Two paper copies, along with a digital copy of the maps and the report will be delivered to each studied community. The digital copy will be delivered on either a suitable

<DESC>Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Pearl Harbor plans to award multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for miscellaneous safety clothing and supplies in support of the Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility. The Federal Supply Classes (FSCs)are as follows: 8105, 8305, 8310, 8320, 8330, 8340, 8405, 8410, 8415 and 8440. Interested vendors are required to submit a price list for each proposed items fall under these FSCs.  Major items procured in the past are booties, canvas, safety clothing, coverall, gloves, herculites, Kevlar, naugahdyde, rainsuit and webbing. The average number of orders issue per year is 271 with estimated value ranging from $350,000 to $400,000 per year. All BPA orders are generally competed among the BPA holders using the simplified acquisition procedures. However, the government reserves the right to limit competition for individual requirements to selected BPA holders, i.e., HUBZone, 8(a) or Service Disabled Veteran-owned businesses, to accomplish its socio-economic goals.  The BPAs will have a period of performance of 5 years.  In accordance with FAR 13.303-6, the government will review the BPA at least annually.  If necessary, the Government will update or modify existing arrangements as a result of i.e, ?changes in market conditions, sources of supply, and other pertinent factors that may warrant making new arrangements with different suppliers or modifying existing arrangements.?  The Government reserves the right to cancel any contractor?s BPA for any reason, including but not limited to: poor performance, failure to respond to requests for quotes, vendor?s prices are determined to be no longer competitive, and all o!  f the reasons listed under FAR 13.303-6(b)(2).       Blanket Purchase Agreement Calls (BPCs) will be issued for any orders placed under any awarded BPA.   Offerors must be authorized dealers or resellers of products that they are offering to the Government at the time of the offering.  Interested vendors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror/quoter INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD. Call 1-888-227-2423 or visit the Internet site http://www.ccr.gov/ for more information. All interested and responsible parties shall refer to the Navy Electronics Online (NECO) website at www.neco.navy.mil for all future Amendments issued against this requirement, solicitation package and submission of bids. The Solicitation package will be available on 10 December 2007. Only electronic bids utilizing email or through NECO are acceptable. ALL QUESTIONS MUST be received no later than 21 December 2007 @ 4:00 PM Guam Time. Quotes must be received no later than the anticipated due date of 28 December 2007 @ 4:00 P.M. Hawaii Time.

An example of the non-price evaluation factors is as follow, however; potential offerors will need to refer to the solicitation (when issued) for the selection criteria/factors to be evaluated by the government since they are subject to change. A) EXPERIENCE - PROJECTS OF A SIMILAR NATURE, MAGNITUDE AND SCOPE; LOCATED IN AN EXTREME ARCTIC ENVIRONMENT WITH VERY LIMITED ACCESS; B) PAST PERFORMANCE - IN RELATION TO THE EXPERIENCE/PROJECTS SUBMITTED; AND C) CAPACITY - ABILITY TO PERFORM THIS PROJECT RELATIVE TO OTHER WORK.  The NAICS Code is 236117 and size standard is $31M.  The estimated range of this project is $100,000 - $500,000.  The government intends to award a contract without discussions with the potential contractors.  This project is subject to the Davis-Bacon Act.  Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed price.

Responders are advised that the requirement(s) may be delayed, cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation, and/or final award process based on decisions related to DOI and NPS changes. Contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) government system prior to award to be eligible for a government contract - the link can be found at http://www.ccr.gov/ -- we advise potential offerors to begin the registration process when they prepare their proposal to ensure the registration in the CCR database is complete and in-place should they be selected for the award. In the event an offeror is not registered in CCR at the time the contracting officer is ready to award the contract, the contracting officer will proceed to the next eligible successful offeror registered in the CCR database.  Refer to FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, "If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror." Offerors submitting a proposal as a Joint Venture should remember that Joint Ventures must also be registered in CCR identical to the joint venture indicated in their proposal (failure to do so will make the offeror[s] ineligible for award).  The anticipated posting date to the NBC and Federal Business Opportunities Website will be on or about January 08, 2008 (subject to change) and proposals will be due on or about February 05, 2008 (subject to change) 2:00 p.m. Alaska Local Time.  The solicitation (and subsequent amendments if applicable) and all related documents can be downloaded electronically (once posted) from the DOI NBC Website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov/ AND the National Park Service Public ftp site (which will contain drawings, specifications, etc.) that are not posted at the IDEAS-EC website.

<DESC>NASA/John C. Stennis Space Center in Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi has recently been selected as the test site for the construction on a new A-3 Altitute Test Facility.  The new test facility will provide an altitude propulsion test capability with will enable the Constellation Program's Exploration Launch Office, J-2X Project Element to validate the performance of the J2-X engine for the upper stage of the new ARES I launch vehicle.  The A-3 Altitude Test Facility will be constructed for long term altitude rocket propulsion testing at Stennis Space Center. While the construction of the A-3 Altitude Facility will involve a significant number of individual procurement actions, this requirement is solely focused on the High Pressure Air Storage Vessels.  This presolicitation synopsis is to request industry feedback regarding the fabrication and delivery of sixty-four (64) High Pressure Air Storage Vessels to NASA/Stennis Space Center.  Due to program schedule milestones, the vessels shall be fabricated in a concurrent process.  Additionally, NASA is requesting information regarding suggested methods of shipping and installation of the 46.1 cubic feet water volume (CFWV) air ready storage tanks.  (Can they be fabricated entirely at the manufacturer's facilities and shipped to NASA/SSC, or is field assembly required?)  Stennis Space Center has access to river barge traffic as a means of transportation. Each vessel shall utilize seamless construction techniques; shall be National Board Registered and ASME code stamped per ASME Code Section VII, Div. 1.  The vessel shal be vertically mounted, cylindrical type single wall construction with hemi-spherically shaped heads; the vessel shall be suitable for the stationary, exposed above ground storage of missile grade air; off loading requirements shall be a part of the resulting contract.  Also, NASA/SSC requests industry input regarding schedule performance for these vessels.  (What is a reasonable expected period of performance?) The proposed vessels are as described: 1. Material used in construction of the vessel walls shall conform to the requirements of ASME SA372, Grade J, Class 70 carbon steel or an approved equal compatible with dry air service; 2.  46.1 cubic feet water volume, minimum working pressure 3,750 psig and a minimum design pressure of 3,750 psig; 3.The design temperature shall be -20 degrees F to +200 degrees F. 4.  All vessels shall be cleaned for air service to a level conforming to SSTD 8070-0089 FLUIDS Standard Level 1. This synopsis should not be construed as a formal request for proposals, but rather a presolicitation synopsis requesting information under the authority of FAR 15.201.  Responses to this request for information are not offers and cannot be accepted by the agency to form a binding contract.  This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  NASA/SSC does not intend to award a contract at this time but will use information obtained for market analysis and to plan future procurements. NASA desires that those companies expressing an interest in the aforementioned presolicitation synopsis provide a written submission of Qualifications and Statement of Capabilities that address high-level alternatives and general, market-based approaches for performing the functions described in this presolicitation synopsis.  NASA would prefer that the written submissions not contain confidential business or financial information relating to specific companies. All prospective companies are reminded to direct their written electronic correspondence to the attention of:  Gregory Fletcher at gregory.fletcher-1@nasa.gov.	Those prospective companies shall have their Qualifications and Statement of Capabilities submitted to the above identified Government representative and received in the NASA/Office of Procurement no later than December 10, 2007 at 3:00 Central Time.  FACSIMILE CORRESPONDENCE OR TELEPHONE CORRESPONDENCE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>This is a Request for Proposals from organizations and individuals to assist the Postal Regulatory Commission staff in developing a Report on Universal Postal Service and the Postal Monopoly to be submitted to the President and Congress in late 2008.

The Postal Regulatory Commission is an agency of the federal government with responsibility for analyzing the rates and fees charged by the U.S. Postal Service for its products and services and for ensuring its service standards are met.  The Commission was created by the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA) and was formerly called the Postal Rate Commission.  It has a staff complement of about 57 employees, primarily skilled in accounting, economics and the law.

Section 702 of the Postal Enhancement and Accountability Act (PAEA) requires the Postal Regulatory Commission (?PRC? or ?the Commission?) to submit a report to the President and Congress on universal postal service and the postal monopoly in the United States, including the monopoly on the delivery of mail and on access to mail boxes.  Universal postal service, also referred to as universal service obligation (USO), is mandated by law and defines the minimum mail service to which each citizen is entitled.  Generally, the USO incorporates five features: (1) access to retail services and delivery, (2) frequency of delivery, (3) quality of service, (4) affordability, and (5) range of mail products offered.  Because providing a minimum level service to every citizen may not be profitable under certain conditions, a USO is generally financed by granting exclusive rights to the postal administration to provide selected services, i.e., a postal monopoly.  Over the last ten years, many countries, mostly in Europe, have begun to reduce the postal monopoly while at the same time ensuring some minimum level of service for each citizen.  It is within this context that Congress has mandated this study.

The PAEA lists a series of items Congress expects to be included in the Report.  Each of these items actually represents tasks to be performed, some of which might be considered descriptive in nature and some of which might be considered analytic in nature.  The Commission has decided to outsource some of the work.  Although there are discrete tasks, each task represents a part of the ultimate report, and so prospective providers should recognize how each task relates to the other tasks so as to provide a meaningful comprehensive report.  It would not be an understatement to characterize this report as critical to the future of the Postal Service and stakeholders since Congress may act on any recommendations included in the report.  For this reason, care and due diligence must be exercised in carrying out the tasks.

Subject project is to replace current Johnson Controls DSC 8500 controllers with the latest generation Johnson Controls METASYS controllers.  Contractor will work with the AE IDIQ plans and schedules to determine where and how the new METASYS will be distributed and must be compatible with the existing Johnson Controls.  Distribution will require wiring into existing air handling units, exhaust fans, relief fans, chiller loops, heating loops, heat exchangers, etc into the new METASYS controller.  More critical to the project is the ability to program the new controllers so they can communicate, over the fiber backbone, with the campus-2ide METASYS engineering control system including the Network Computer in Bldg 400 and the operator work stations in the M&R Shop.  The new controllers are to be installed in the existing conduit cabinets and will be reusing the conduit as a matter of saving Government funds.  As a result of decreased manning he VA intends to make a sole source award to Johnson Control Systems which will result in standardization of resources, equipment and inventory needs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Desalinization and Water Filtration Using Carbon Nanotubes

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS) under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license, develop, and commercialize new technology using carbon nanotubes for desalinization and water filtration.    

Background:	The water supplies of the world face increasing stress because of increasing populations, pollution, and drought. There is a need for an efficient means of filtering and desalinizing water which does not use excessive amounts of energy and can provide highly effective filtration of both chemicals and biological organisms.

Description:  Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied fluid flow through microfabricated membranes which had aligned carbon nanotubes with pores with diameters of less than 2 nanometers. The researchers discovered that water flow rates exceeded classical models by three orders of magnitude.   These carbon nanotube membranes demonstrated permeabilities which are several orders of magnitude higher than conventional membranes, despite having pore sizes an order of magnitude smaller. This discovery initiated efforts to create a new technology providing energy-efficient nanoscale filtration using carbon nanotubes. The researchers published their findings in Science Magazine (19 May 2006, Vol. 312. no. 5776, pp. 1034 ? 1037) http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/312/5776/1034.pdf after filing a patent application covering the invention.

Advantages:  This new technology offers the following potential advantages over existing water filtration technology:  
?	Can filter out both chemicals and biological organisms (bacteria and viruses).
?	Lower energy consumption than reverse osmosis or distillation.
?	High flow rates compared to traditional membrane filters.
?	No chemicals used in the processing.
?	No harmful by-products produced from using the process.

Potential Applications:  The most immediate application of this invention relates to water purification and desalinization. However, the technology also has applications relating to other fluids, though these applications are less researched. For water purification and desalinization, this technology could apply to small scale personal applications (e.g. hikers, boaters, campers, military personnel, home use, etc.), or it could apply to large scale water supplies. 

Development Status:  LLNL researchers have prototyped the use of carbon nanotubes to filter low-salinity water. However, this work is still in the research phase. The researchers have a goal of creating a prototype which will desalinize water.

LLNL is seeking industry partners to help develop and commercialize this technology.   The ideal development partner would have some or all of the following qualifications:
?	Experience in a water related business.
?	Demonstrated ability to bring inventions to the market.
?	The patience to invest at least three years of development to bring this early stage technology to market.
?	The resources to make a significant investment in the development of this technology for commercialization (probably in the millions of dollars).
?	An interest in performing and funding cooperative research at LLNL.
?	Substantial manufacturing and research operations in the United States (mandatory requirement).

Intellectual Property:  LLNL has filed an International Patent Application covering this technology.

All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  For more information, please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php

This website also provides more information regarding LLNL?s industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's technology for desalinization and water filtration using carbon nanotubes should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology

Written responses should be directed to:

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Hamamatsu Corporation for the purchase of ten Silicon Photodiodes.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  The Atomic Physics Division at NIST requires several silicon photodiodes that have the highest quantum efficiency possible at the wavelength where NIST?s experiments work 795 nm.  This requires a silicon photodiode with 100 percent internal quantum efficiency which detects all the light entering the surface of the detector as well as an anti-reflection coating specifically for this wavelength so that all the light that strikes the detector goes in and is not reflected.  Therefore, the silicon photodiode must have the following:  a greater than 99 percent internal quantum efficiency, an active area size 10 mm x 10 mm, maximum capacitance 40 pf, noise equivalent power less than 0.1 picowatt-per-root-hertz, an anti-reflection coating for 795 nm light, and an overall (internal plus external) diode quantum efficiency of 98 percent (minimum 95 percent).  Hamamatsu Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the photodiodes that are required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by December 7, 2007, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Jackie Moore, 703-696-6065
<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS AN AMENDMENT TO RFI USA-SNOTE-071129-003  Emerging Technology Augmented Reality Pilot. Responses to this RFI should be submitted to the Emerging Technology Pilot website, 'http://www.emergingtechnet.com' as listed below, and will not be accepted after 2:00 P.M. EST, January 15, 2007. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: Participation in Emerging Technology Augmented Reality Pilot.  This is a Request for Information in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations 15.201.  The US Army Contracting Agency, Contracting Center of Excellence (CCE) at the Pentagon, on behalf of Department of Defense Chief Information Office (DoD CIO). Inquiries: Questions shall be submitted via e-mail to Jackie.Moore@hqda.army.mil or Donald.Leath@hqda.army.mil no later than 3:00 P.M. EST, December 5, 2007. DESCRIPTION:  The Department of Defense makes significant investments in a number of different information technology systems.  Often when conducting a review of the most appropriate technology, emerging technologies are considered.  By definition, an emer ging technology is one who's science, basic principles, and theory are understood, and at least some useful applications are recognized; one that made the challenging journey from promising idea to indispensable invention.  Unfortunately, it is often diffi cult to gather information about the various emerging technologies that can best satisfy a capability need.    It is essential that program offices, requirements personnel and technologists have an awareness of the latest emerging technologies when conduct ing their analysis of alternatives tasks. PURPOSE:  The DoD CIO is conducting an emerging technology pilot focused on Augmented Reality research and technologies.  The purpose is to bring together emerging technology vendors and researchers with potential DoD buyers by providing an environment tha t enables potential future buyers to discover ongoing research and development in emerging technologies.  This pilot project is intended to provide insight to a systemic solution to the research required to discover emerging technology. It is anticipated t hat a subset of the DoD requirements and acquisition community interested in future requirements and programmatic decisions potentially involving augmented reality technology will be viewing the content. SCOPE:  While a full net-centric technology taxonomy is provided, for the duration of the Pilot (60 days), the only net-centric technology fully detailed will be the Augmented Reality area. For the purposes of this project, emerging technology solutions ar e categorized as still developing devices, standards, applications, software and services which can aid in implementing net-centric operations.  At the point of sale, emerging technologies cease to be considered emerging and are instead looked at as COTS p roducts.  However, refinements under development for existing COTS products can be considered emerging technology. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PARTICIPATION:  The DoD CIO Emerging Technology Pilot is located at http://www.emergingtechnet.com.  Interested Augmented Reality researchers and vendors should go to this site and then click on the Industry and Researcher Participation  page.  This page has instructions for registering on the site, and for filling out a vendor/researcher overview page and descriptions of your research and products.  Additionally, you may update the Augmented Reality page as appropriate.  All told, it is  anticipated that participation in the pilot will take well less than an hours time. NOTE:  This information is for market research only.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), or solicitation or an indication that the government will contract for this requirement.  The government will not pay for information received in response to th is RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received. SUMMARY:  The DoD CIO appreciates your assistance with this emerging technology pilot and emphasize s that this effort is for pilot purposes only.  Responses and participation will not be treated as proposals, but may be used to aid in the development of a fully operational emerging technology discovery system.  Respondents should ensure that no propriet ary information is submitted in response to this RFI.

<DESC>This market survey is being conducted by the General Services Administration (GSA) to seek minority contractors who are interested in submitting a Request for Qualifications for the Repair and Alterations (R&A) of the C. Clifton Young Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse, 300 Booth Street, Reno, Nevada,  Design/Build Project.   The project would ideally be set aside for a women-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or 8(a) small businesses.  The number of responses received from interested minority contractors shall determine whether  this requirement  can be set aside.

The C. Clifton Young Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse is a five-story building that was built in 1965.  To date no major alteration of any kind has been undertaken during its service life.  However due to continuous maintenance and selective equipment upgrades, the building is currently in acceptable operating condition.  The anchor tenant in the building is the United States Bankruptcy Court (USBC) and the remaining federal tenant agencies primarily provide support.  

The design-build method of contracting will be utilized for this project.  The selected design-build contractor must be a viable corporate entity having familiarity and knowledge with federal court construction.  The contractors' past performanceand experiences on similar past/present projects must be verifiable.  It is essential that the contractor be able to competently budget, schedule, and provide quality control.  The design-build contractor will be evaluated objectively on a competitive basis, relying on the background and ability of the contractor from the information provided.  A quantitative evaluation process will not be used to select the contractor.

The proposed renovation work includes asbestos abatement; demolition and removal work; new roofing; building accessibility upgrades; fire-safety upgrades; new fire sprinkler system; plumbing upgrades; electrical upgrades; ADA code compliance; air-flow study and HVAC upgrades; site improvement; dedicated water supply installation; building water service improvements; and repair of the building curtain wall.  The primary project goal is to avoid building system failures and improve the overall reliability and operability of the building for approximately the next fifteen years.  No architectural modernization is anticipated.  The building will be occupied and fully operational during construction.  Tenant agencies will move around within the building to accommodate construction.

Interested contractors must submit a Letter of Interest and a Resume displaying their firm's qualifications and past performance on similar projects in order to participate in the Design/Build project.  These must both be sent via e-mail to the Contracting Specialist, Christopher Lee, at christopher.lee@gsa.gov by no later than 4:30 P.M. PST on Wednesday JANUARY 16, 2008.

<DESC>This is a combined brand name justification and sources sought notice.  EPA R1 intends to upgrade two existing DataDomain DD530 in order to provide addition capacity to the region?s backup architecture.  It is believed that the upgrades to the DD530 units purchased must be DataDomain units because the software is proprietary to the company and the upgrade hardware is only manufactured by DataDomain.  If you know of another brand that is capable of providing addition capacity to our DD530 please let us know.  The upgrade we are looking for includes a license and 6 disk drive (3TB); we would also like a 1yr platinum service plan (24x7xNBD).  Additionally, if you carry the above equipment please identify your potential interest in fulfilling our requirement.  Please submit responses by 12/7/07.

<DESC>NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for flight batteries to be used on ARES I. Comments are to be forwarded to Robert Dolesh only via electronic or facsimile transmission at the numbers listed below. Do NOT call the Primary point of contact listed on this notice. This notice is issued by the NASA/GRC to post a draft Statement of Work via the internet, and solicit responses from interested parties. Prospective offerors are invited to submit written or verbal comments or questions to: Robert Dolesh, email: Robert.J.Dolesh@nasa.gov, phone:(216)433-8359 Fax: (216) 433-6382, no later than December 31, 2007. See the attachments which contain the draft SOW and Specifications.  The anticipated type of procurement action is to obtain commercially available units that are configured to meet NASA's specific function. Some units will also need to undergo spaceflight qualification (i.e.environmental) testing prior to delivery. Flight units will also need to undergo acceptance testing (3 line items: commercial unit, commercial units spaceflight qualified, commercial units acceptance tested prior to flight).  An indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract is anticipated with minimum and maximum number of Battery units over a 5 year period will be specified. The contractor is expected to be able to either perform itself or subcontract out the environmental and space flight qualification testing.  The following information is requested: Please identify if there is anything unclear in the SOW/Specification documents. Will having TBD's (specs portions to be finalized after award) pose a problem with proposing a firm fixed price for performance?   It is assumed that a slightly modified commercial item will be procured, however, if the specifications attached indicate that a commercial item procurement is not possible, please inform us. Do any requirements in the CEI Spec or SOW pose a significant price increase from your commercially available hardware? Does any of the testing in the CxP 70036 (ENVIRONMENTAL QUALIFICATION AND ACCEPTANCE TESTING REQUIREMENTS (CEQATR) need to be better defined? Are there any verification methods that may be changed to reduce cost, schedule while still maintaining assurance of required performance?  The ?Ares I Upper Stage (US) Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) Battery Component End Item (CEI) Specification? (GRC-AVI-SPEC-0002),  was specifically written toward Silver Zinc Batteries but will be modified to include either Silver Zinc or Lithium Ion.  Certain requirements do not apply to one or the other chemistry and this will be clarified in a future revision.  For Lithium Ion the anticipated cycle life is 100 cycles.  The required 90 day pad stay time without recharge will not change.  Also, JSC-20793, Crewed Space Vehicle Battery Safety Requirements contains important safety design features that should be incorporated into Lithium Ion battery designs. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror?s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>Request for Information:  Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Varian, Inc. for repairs and Service Contracts on the existing Varian Flame Atomic Absorption Instrument in Beltsville, MD and the existing AA Spectrophotometer and autosampler in Walnut Creek, CA. The Government intends to award a contract for a base period of one year, to include travel and expenses.

Mission:  TTB?s mission is to collect alcohol and tobacco excise taxes; to ensure that these products are labeled, advertised, and marketed in accordance with the law; to administer the laws and regulations in a manner that protects the consumer and revenue, and promotes voluntary compliance.

Nature and Description of Action:  The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau?s Lab has previously acquired the Varian analytical lab instrument, and now has a requirement for post-warranty service. This service is critical to the mission, as there is a need for uninterrupted use and operation of these instruments.

A sole source to Varian, Inc. is intended for this order, based on the fact that they are the manufacturer of the equipment and supplier of parts.  No other known source has these capabilities, and warranties are subject to cancellation if the instruments are not maintained and repaired according to manufacturer?s specifications.

No solicitation document is available.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than fourteen days after publication of this notice.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Varian, Inc.  If you would like a copy of the Sole Source Justification, please fax or e-mail your request.

Point of Contact:  
Mindy Wargowsky, Contract Specialist:  Tel: 304-480-7034  //  Fax: 304-480-7204  //  psb3@bpd.treas.gov

<DESC>Request for Information:  Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Anton Parr USA Inc. for Service Contracts on the existing Anton Paar Alcohol Density Meters in Beltsville, MD and in Walnut Creek, CA. The Government intends to award a contract for a base period of one year, to include travel and expenses.

Mission:  TTB?s mission is to collect alcohol and tobacco excise taxes; to ensure that these products are labeled, advertised, and marketed in accordance with the law; to administer the laws and regulations in a manner that protects the consumer and revenue, and promotes voluntary compliance.

Nature and Description of Action:  The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau?s Lab has previously acquired the Anton Paar analytical lab instruments, and now has a requirement for continued service and certification. This service is critical to the mission, as there is a need for uninterrupted use and operation of these instruments, as well as certification.

A sole source to Anton Paar USA,  Inc. is intended for this order, based on the fact that they are the manufacturer of the equipment and supplier of the software and hardware components for these systems.  No other known source has these capabilities, and warranties are subject to cancellation if the instruments are not maintained and repaired according to manufacturer?s specifications.

No solicitation document is available.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than fourteen days after publication of this notice.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Anton Paar.  If you would like a copy of the Sole Source Justification, please fax or e-mail your request.

<ARCHDATE>02262008
<CONTACT>Lindsay Roop Contract Specialist 612-467-2176
<DESC>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI).  This is not a request for proposal and no award will be made as a result of this announcement.  The information received as a result of this announcement will be used for market research purposes. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Midwest Health Care Network (VISN 23) is seeking information from prospective contractors to provide simulation-based cross-disciplinary team training in Rapid Response Team (RRT) and Code Team scenarios ("event-based" training), and to create, assist or consult in the development of a VISN 23-based in-situ critical-event team training program.   The overall goal is to measurably improve team-based skills and performance in critical event management and to facilitate the system-wide development of a culture of safety and teamwork by implementing a uniform and systematic multi-disciplinary team training process across the Network.      The emphasis in this RFI is to acquire information pertaining to RRT training.  Training should include "hands-on," real time practice in both common and rarely-performed critical skills in acute inpatient clinical crises.    There are two components to this RFI.  Appropriately experienced potential contractors may respond to one or both components.   The first component is a request for information regarding simulation-based team training in both rapid response and code scenarios at an established simulation team-training center.  The scope of this component includes seven Medical Centers within VISN 23: Des Moines, IA; Fargo, ND; Fort Meade, SD; Iowa City, IA; Minneapolis, MN; Omaha, NE; and Sioux Falls, SD.  Rapid response and code teams from each site vary in size from two to eight members.  Team composition varies between sites and there is some overlap between code team and rapid response team members.  It is anticipated that an average of four team members from each of the seven sites would participate in the simulation based training exercise.   The VA is seeking centers that have extensive experience in simulation-based team training in both rapid response and code team scenarios.  The VA is looking for information on training that incorporates technical and cognitive skills as well as teamwork skills applicable to the management of critical events.  Training would explicitly include the following elements: differential diagnosis for each training scenario, definition and explanation of critical roles and the roles and responsibilities of each team member (including taking and ceding leadership, leadership and cross-disciplinary communication skills and tools, the appropriate sequence of response for each team member in each scenario), realistic replication of the "look and feel" of the relevant critical event environment, "hands on" practice of relevant clinical skills, introduction of environmental or other distractions, recognition of communication failures, examples of effective and ineffective team performance and system-level impediments to optimal performance.    The VA is also seeking information on RRT scenarios that include: altered mental status, respiratory distress, and hypotension, and may also include: tachypnea, bradycardia, tachycardia, increasing oxygen requirements, chest pain and acute inpatient myocardial infarction, major blood loss in an inpatient setting, acute inpatient stroke, and acute inpatient severe sepsis.  Code scenarios would include respiratory arrest, ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, pulseless electrical activity and asystole, and may include others.  The second component is a request for information regarding the ability to formulate an ongoing training program for use in all VISN 23 sites on an ongoing basis.  The objective is to create or procure a fully developed and comprehensive program for ongoing in-situ simulation-based education and training in team-based management of critical events (acute clinical deterioration in the inpatient setting), specifically including typical RRT and code scenarios.  Since "team" membership is fluid and travel to a remote location is not often practical, and since skills and knowledge are continuously evolving, VISN 23 sites need to be able to continue to train RRT and Code Teams of continuously varying composition and personnel on their own campus and on a flexible time schedule on an ongoing basis.  The VA is interested in information regarding a training program that will most realistically simulate the RRT or code scenario in the actual environment at that site, and that can ensure a level of training that approaches or exceeds the level available at a high fidelity clinical simulation center.  This includes training in team dynamics, interaction, roles and responsibilities, and critical communication skills.  Potential contractors would develop and/or consult and/or assist VISN 23 in the development of this training program.   This RFI requests information to explore the full range of options to accomplish this objective.  Possible options may include in-situ or mobile high fidelity wireless mannequin centered training, and/or computer-based team simulation/teaching programs in both RRT and code scenarios, and/or self-guided and primarily cognitively based learning modules.  A successful program may incorporate a stepped educational and training approach in more than one of these modalities.  The final plan should be applicable to VA sites of widely varying size, type, and geographic location.   Respondents are asked to provide information on each of the following points:  1) Information on the capability to provide a high fidelity simulation-based team training experience in RRT and code scenarios, with an emphasis on RRT team training for all VISN 23 RRT and Code Teams at an established simulation center.  In addition, provide information on developing a comprehensive in-situ simulation-based team training program as described above.  Provide information on how you would meet the objectives and what capabilities you have to respond to one or both components of this request.   2) If applicable, describe your team training process in detail.  Provide information regarding whether the training process includes live vide feed to observer-participants, feedback and debriefing following each simulation exercise, video recording of the exercise training made available to the teams, education to include explanation and definition of team roles and responsibilities, differential diagnoses of specific RRT and code scenarios, and analysis and critique of team performance.  3) If applicable, describe how your team training has been applied in the past. 4) If applicable, describe the development and applications of any projects for in-situ or mobile simulation-based team training programs for RRT and code scenarios, such as high fidelity, wireless mannequin-based team training, or personal computer-based software programs in team training.  Describe whether these programs require on-site and/or remote training experts to organize and guide the training experience or whether they are self-guided learning experiences.       5) Describe any existing software and/or equipment and/or learning devices or other products or applications that you have developed to provide a personal computer-based and/or in-situ simulation-based team training experience in RRT or code scenarios or other similar inpatient critical event scenarios.   6) Describe how you would propose to develop, assist or consult in the development of a comprehensive in-situ or mobile simulation-based team training program for VISN 23 sites, meeting the objectives described above. Describe your proposed implementation process and anticipated time duration for implementation of this program.  7) Describe any qualifications of trainer(s) that you require for your programs. 8) Describe any industry innovative practices and/or products concerning simulation-based team training in RRT and Code Team scenarios or other similar inpatient critical event scenarios.   9) Describe the application of your programs and products to any projects similar in size and scope that have been completed.  10) Provide any cost estimate available to assist in the development of the VA's plan.   The requested information is for planning purposes, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action may be issued.  However, the VA will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning.  It is recognized that any cost information provided by the contractor is a preliminary estimate for planning purposes and may be marked as proprietary; the contractor will not be bound to these estimates. The VA invites comments related to possible purchase or acquisition strategies. If there is a FSS, GSA or other contract vehicle already available for the products being proposed, please include this information in the response. All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as corporate or proprietary will be fully protected from release outside the government. It is not the intent of VA to reimburse contractors for the cost of submitting information in response to this RFI. The VA will not return pictures, documents, graphs or interrelated requested information.  Please direct any questions to Lindsay Roop, Contracting Officer, at e-mail lindsay.roop@va.gov. Interested parties are encouraged to submit their information as soon as possible.  The deadline is 12/28/07.  However, information received beyond this date may still be considered.  Interested parties can submit information via the following sources; mail, email or fax.   All requests for clarification or information must be submitted via emails or fax to Lindsay Roop. Please send all information to:  Lindsay C. Roop, Contracting Officer, VA Medical Center (90C), One Veterans Drive, Minneapolis, MN 55417.

Project Description:   Publi c Law 98 151, 5 U.S.C. 5724C authorizes Government Agencies to enter into a contract for relocation services for its civilian employees. Defense Management Report Decision 974 consolidates the relocation functions into one.  The U.S. Army, Corps of Enginee rs has been designated the Executive Agent for the DOD Consolidated Relocation Program by the Director of the DOD Civilian Personnel Management Service.  The assignment of this mission was based on the Corps' real estate expertise. The Baltimore District, Corps of Engineers, National Relocation Program Office (NRPO) administered the DOD National Relocation Program (DNRP) since 1995, and the Department of Army relocation program before that since 1987.  The NRPO has awarded six consecutive relocation contrac ts currently spanning twenty years.  The proposed action is a re-procurement of these relocation services.  The services provided by these contracts have proven to be a valuable benefit to employees, and their commands in their Permanent Change of Station (PCS) transfers under the Base Realignment and Closure Act (BRAC), as well as other routine re-assignments.  Over the life of the Department of Defense Relocation Services for Employees Program, approximately 22,000 civilian employees have benefited by the se services.  Over $5 billion worth of real estate has been processed by the various DOD components under the DNRP.  The DOD National Relocation Program expects to process an estimated 1,200 civilian transferring employees annually using a one (1) year req uirements-type contract with four (4) one-year options to process real estate valued at approximately $1.8 billion.  The estimated average value is $300,000. There are no minimum or maximum guarantees required before award. The government intends to provid e opportunity for periodic economic price adjustments during the term of the contract.The DoD Relocation Services contract will provide the following services to authorized DoD transferring employees in all 50 states and possessions as identified in the JT R, Volume 2:  a. Relocation Information Counseling: The contractor provides general information to DoD employees on the National Relocation Program.  Through this service, the contractor arranges for real estate assistance in the destination area when requ ested by the transferring employee.  This service will be provided at no charge or obligation to the DOD.  b. Marketing Assistance: The contractor will assist the transferees in developing an effective marketing strategy for their homes, providing a Broker s Price Opinion (BPO) reflecting a realistic current market estimate of value.  Costs for providing the Marketing Assistance will be reflected in the fees charg ed for the Appraised Value and Amended Sale.  c. Guaranteed Home Sale Service: The contractor offers to purchase the eligible residences from the transferring employees at an average of two current market value appraisals.  Bona fide open-market offers mad e after appraisals and resulting from employee's marketing are treated as amended sale offers.  Buyer Value Option (BVO) will also be available which will allow the transferring employees to sell the residences to the relocation contractor based on a bona fide amount offered by open-market buyers prior to appraisal.  The contractor shall be required to take legal title and either pay off the existing mortgage or provide an acceptable surety method that protects the transferring employees interests at the t ime the property is acquired by the contractor.  d. Property Management Program: The contractor will manage the primary residence of authorized transferred employees at old duty-station locations for a period determined by the JTR at DOD expense in cases w here the transferees are reasonably expected to return to the old duty station.  e. Destination Area Assistance: The contractor will provide services to aid the transferee in acquiring a residence at the new duty station at no cost to DOD.  These services include, but are not limited to:  (1) Home Finding for Buyers: Provided by a destination area real estate broker assigned by the contractor and assists the transferees in locating a residence which meets the individual requirements of the employees and the ir family.  (2) Home Finding for Renters: Provide basic counseling and assistance to obtain rental housing in the new duty station. Rental Finder Fees customarily paid by the renter shall be the responsibility of the transferee.  Fees for service beyond th e basic level will be borne as an expense to the employee.  (3) Mortgage Counseling: Provide information on types of mortgages, rates, fees, basic lender qualifications and availability of financing in the new area.  In addition to providing consumer infor mation about the mortgage market, the contractor will be required to offer a choice of at least three competing nationwide residential mortgage lending companies over which the contractor will have an oversight relationship.  This will allow the transferri ng DoD employee the option of lender choice and increase the potential for the best possible mortgage agreement.  This contract will service the entire DOD civilian community nationwide to include U.S. possessions as identified in the Joint Travel Regulati ons, Volume 2.  The numbers of Permanent Change of Station (PCS) moves utilizing these services may reach or exceed 1,200 annually depending on the impact of the anticipated Base Realignment and Closure action.  Although Department of Army will be administ ering the program, each DOD department will establish its own eligibility criteria for use of the program by its employees.  The primary purpose of the relocation services contractor is to provide an offer to the transferring employees to purchase their re sidences for a guaranteed dollar amount based on current real estate market value established either by appraisal or open-market competition.  It is therefore necessary that the contractor have access to large financial resources, and the capability to man age a nationwide network of vendors that is utilized to perform functions that include, but are not limited to appraisals, general and specific housing inspections, real estate market analysis, title services, and resale of property.  Additionally, the con tractor must have the capability to provide property management services provided by vendors operating in the proximity of the property.  The majority of these individual functions are performed by local small businesses in the vicinity of the employees r esidence in support of the contractors overall service product.  The relocation services required under this contract have historically been provided to DoD by  one primary nationwide relocation contractor.  These services are anticipated to be under one contract to facilitate a well-coordinated and efficient delivery of services to DoD customer agencies and their transferring civilian employees.

STANDARD COMPETITION TENTATIVE DECISION ANNOUNCEMENT  

MAXWELL AFB SOFTWARE SERVICES FUNCTION 

The 42d Air Base Commander, Col. Paul H. McGillicuddy, of AETC has announced a tentative performance decision of Software Services.  Competition between agency tender and contract performance determined Diligent Consulting, Inc., 8603 N. New Braunfels, Suite B, San Antonio TX 78217  performance to be the most efficient and cost effective method of operation.  This competition affects a total of 30 DoD personnel 0 officers, 16 enlisted, 14 civilians, and 16 Contract Manpower Equivalents.  

This standard competition was conducted in compliance with the Air Force policies in AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, which implements the Office of Management and Budget Circular (OMBC) A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities.  This Circular reaffirms the Government?s policy to rely on the private sector for commercial products and services.  When in-house performance of commercial activities is not required for national defense reasons and contracting is more cost effective, conversion to contract performance is in the best interest of the American taxpayer.

When a competition between an agency and contract performance determines contracting is more cost effective, OMBC A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation require the contractor to offer adversely affected civilian and NAF employees the Right of First Refusal for employment openings to positions (under the contract) for which they are qualified.  Since DoD is sensitive to the personal impact this action may have on civilian employees, the DoD Program for Stability of Civilian Employment ensures every effort is made to help adversely affected civilian employees who desire placement assistance.  These employees may register in the Defense-wide computerized Priority Placement Program.  Registrants under this program receive placement rights to vacancies within DoD (other Federal agencies are also solicited).  When adversely affected civilian employees must relocate to continue Federal employment, transportation and moving expenses are paid by the Government.

Background
Detainee Telephone System (DTS) History
Each year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), undertakes immigration enforcement actions involving hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals.  These actions include the arrest, detention, and removal from the United States of foreign nationals who are in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  These violations include:  losing legal status by failing to abide by the terms and conditions of entry, or by engaging in crimes such as terrorist activity? violent crimes, document fraud, and drug smuggling.  Responsibility for the enforcement of immigration laws within the interior United States rests with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Detainees are held at Service Processing Centers (SPCs), Contract Detention Facilities (CDFs), (normally ?Primary Detention Facilities?) and State/local government facilities (Inter-Governmental Service Agreement facilities-IGSA) (normally ?Secondary Detention Facilities?) located throughout the US and US Territories.
Current Detainee Telephone System contract with PCS
Current detention telephone services are provided by Public Communications Services (PCS) under contract COW-4-C-0122 and is known as Detainee Telephone Services-IV (DTS-IV). DTS-IV is in the last option year and ICE Office of Acquisitions Management is now soliciting new proposals.  The current contract does not require any revenue sharing with ICE.  PCS currently provides all calling service in either a collect or pre-paid/debit system at Primary sites only.  Calls are either local, long-distance, or International.  Also, PCS provides a pro-bono system at all sites that allows detainees free calls to specifically authorized numbers.  PCS utilizes a series of speed dial numbers associated with the corresponding approved numbers.  Currently, there are no calls being recorded or monitored.  However, that option is available.
Overview of the Current DTS
ICE National Detention Standards (NDS) guarantees all detainees free telephone access to ICE identified entities. These ICE identified entities include foreign Embassies, Consulates, Immigration Courts and approved pro bono and community based free immigration legal service providers. PCS provides this free telephone access at all ICE identified ?over 72 hour? Inter-governmental Services Agreement (IGSA) facilities and at ICE Primary locations. PCS accomplishes this contractual requirement by hosting a ?pro-bono network? which allows all ICE detainees access to identified entities. PCS hosts this pro-bono platform at no cost to ICE or to the detainees. In return, PCS receives all debit card and collect calling revenue from ICE primary locations. As this is a $0 cost contract, this is the only revenue PCS receives. Currently, all ICE Primary facilities allow detainees controlled access to the PCS operated telephone system to make both outgoing debit-card, collect and free pro-bono calls.  Only free pro-bono calls are accomplished at ICE Secondary facilities.  None of these sites allow for incoming calls. The DTS supports all current requirements of the ICE Detention Standards ? Telephone Access (National Detention Standards of September 2000 or as Amended).  The DTS offeror will work closely with the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR), and ICE/DRO Agency Technical Representatives (ATR) acting as support staff.
DTS Contractor Guidelines
This contract will provide DTS servicing for approximately 30,000 total detainees housed at 15 Primary Facilities, and 206 Secondary Facilities.  The offeror should anticipate continued growth in the number of detainees held and in the total number of Primary and Secondary facilities during the contract period. It will be the offeror?s responsibility to ensure compliance with all Federal, State and local Regulatory requirements (e.g. FCC regulations, State PUC requirements, etc.).
If there are no laws, regulations, or guidelines, the offeror will follow generally accepted telecommunication practices in service industry and practices within the inmate calling service industry.  For unusual actions that are not covered by any of the above, the offeror will consult with the Contracting Officer.
Teaming arrangements and joint ventures are allowed but must be fully explained. Care should be taken to prevent disqualification as a small business. Subcontractor roles and responsibilities must also be described in sufficient detail so that it is clear who will do what.
Statement of Objectives
Vision
The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain offers which will support DHS/ICE/DRO operations and compliance with Detention Telephone Access Standards.  This effort is envisioned to provide DHS/ICE with repeatable, defined, accurate, timely, and well managed detention telephone services and processes that will ensure quality service and products that meet these Standards.  This DTS will be implemented and sustained across all DHS/ICE Primary and Secondary Facilities identified as ?over 72-hour facilities?.
Scope
The scope of this solicitation requires that ICE receives a full range of DTS calling services that will significantly support the Detention Telephone Access Standard and meet DHS/ICE field operational goals.  This includes the installation of a ?state of the art? telephone system at all Primary Facilities; the delivery of a complete centralized pro-bono system serving all Primary and Secondary Facilities designated as an ?over 72-hour facility?; rapid and accurate initial transition from the Primary telephone system provider and the set up of a pro-bono network; the ability to rapidly add and delete facilities; accurate reporting and accounting of call volume, debit card sales, collect calling, refunds, complaints; etc.; data collection and trend analysis with action plans for resolution of identified problems; the efficient management of all pro bono activities including accurate tracking of about 2500 speed dial numbers; timely maintenance of the Primary telephone and pro-bono systems; and, an overall robust quality plan that ensures compliance with the offeror?s proposal. 
ICE?s Objectives
ICE, Office of Acquisitions Management, is currently seeking proposals to provide complete detainee telephone services at ?Primary Detention Facilities? and access to a pro bono telephone network for all sites designated as an ?over 72 hour facility?, whether identified as a Primary or Secondary site. These Primary and Secondary sites are located throughout the US and US Territories.  Complete telephone services at the Primary Facilities are defined as all normal inmate telephone services including the requirement to provide physical assets and privacy screens. Current ICE Telephone Detention Standards require at least one phone for every twenty-five inmates. Additionally, all detainees held in an ?over 72 hour facility? must have free telephone access to Consulates, ?pro bono? legal advisors, the DHS Office of Inspector General Hotline, Immigration Courts, and other ICE identified Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO). This ?free access? is required at all ?Primary? and about 250 ?Secondary? facilities (those identified as an ?over 72 hours site?). Provisions must be made to ensure this free telephone access is available to detainees during normal operating hours defined as approximately 7AM to 9PM daily or local facility policies may apply. The current National Detention Standards for Telephone Access are provided as ATTACHMENT A (see Section J of the RFP). 
This contract will be a zero cost ($0) Firm Fixed Price Contract and is a set-aside for small businesses under NAICS 517911 Telecommunications Resellers (1500 employees).  Revenue generated from Detainee debit card and collect calling at Primary Facilities will be the sole source of revenue to the Offerors.  No revenue sharing with ICE is required. No call volume is guaranteed; however, ATTACHMENT  B (see Section J of the RFP) lists the current operating locations, the number of phones required at the Primary facilities, and other statistical information. Recent telephone call volume is detailed below. 
There are currently 15 Primary Facilities with a total Detainee population of approximately 10,000 while another 20,000 detainees are located at ICE Secondary facilities.  There are approximately 1300 total inmate telephones currently installed at these Primary locations.  The average length of stay is 37 days; however, some detainees are held much longer.  There were approximately twelve million (12,000,000) local debit and collect calling minutes; twenty-four million (24,000,000) long distance debit and collect calling minutes; and two million (2,000,000) international debit and collect calling minutes for the most recent twelve month period from these Primary Facilities. Calls are usually limited to 20 minutes, and the hours of access and time limits are determined by the Primary Facilities but are normally 7am to 9pm local.  Primary Facilities will have full detention telephone services as well as access to the pro-bono network described below.
There are currently 206 Secondary Facilities (over 72-hour) which allow detainees to make free pro bono calls only. No equipment is required to be provided at these sites. The list of active Secondary Facilities changes monthly by about 5 facilities (both additions and deletions) with the overall trend tracking upwards.  Pro bono calls are accomplished by the Detainee dialing an access number to a centralized platform.  There are many different inmate telephone service providers currently providing telephone services at Secondary Facilities.  The offeror, working with the various ICE Agency Technical Representative?s (ATR?s), the COTR and the Contracting Officer, will assure that all Facilities have adequate and easy to understand written and verbal instructions, in the languages appropriate for each site, which will enable a connection to all authorized pro-bono speed dial numbers as well as debit card and collect calling.  The offeror must be aware that Per Call Compensation, or other access charges, imposed by the inmate calling system provider at Secondary Facilities, if any, will be paid by the offeror and will not be charged to ICE or the detainees.  After connecting to the centralized pro bono system, detainees are only allowed to dial a speed dial number that correlates to the authorized destination number approved by ICE.  There are currently about 2500 approved pro-bono numbers but the trend is to add new numbers to this list. Consulate numbers frequently change. ICE personnel responsible for each Facility will notify the vendor with an approved local pro-bono list.  ICE approved speed dial telephone numbers range from 200 to about 1000 at each facility.  These pro bono numbers are subject to frequent changes by the authorized agencies and ICE frequently changes the approved list by site.  The accurate management of this process while assuring the success of Detainees to connect to any authorized pro bono number is an important part of this Solicitation.  ICE has appointed forty-two (42) regionally located ATR?s to support ICE compliance issues, including this requirement.  A complete list of ATR Duties is included as ATTACHMENT D (see Section J of the RFP).  All pro-bono numbers are domestic within the United States calling area.  Recent statistics indicate approximately 30,000 to 35,000 pro-bono calls are completed per month with the trend tracking upwards. Time limit per pro-bono call is normally 20 minutes but may vary by site.  There are minimal pro-bono calls after business hours and on weekends but the system must still be available to call the OIG Hotline.  ATTACHMENT C (see Section J of the RFP) provides further information of the call volume statistics.

<SUBJECT>A -- Women's Health Initiative Memory Study Extension
<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Wake Forest University Health Sciences for a three-year continuation of Contract N01-WH-4-4221 for the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS).  Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  

The WHIMS is an ancillary study to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Hormone Therapy (HT) trials.  The WHIMS was initially funded by private industry.  Beginning in 1996, the WHIMS enrolled 7,145 women aged 65-79 at baseline from the WHI hormone trials to test whether HT prevented cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and probable dementia (PD, including Alzheimer's disease).  After the WHI HT trials were stopped early (in 2002 after 4.0 years of follow-up in the trial of Estrogen plus Progestin [E+P]; in 2004 after 5.2 years of follow-up in the trial of Estrogen-alone [E-Alone]) it was found that E+P doubled the risk of PD, while E-Alone increased by 38% the risk of MCI and PD combined.

The current objectives of the WHIMS are to: 
*	Complete WHIMS data collection in the E-Alone trial; 
*	Continue monitoring post-trial cognitive health;
*	Perform brain MRI scans to elucidate the role of vascular disease, following the finding of an increased stroke risk in the HT trials 

The NHLBI began funding the WHIMS in December 2003, at which time 4,173 participants were enrolled.  The 4.6 year funding period was thought to be sufficient to follow the trajectory of MCI and PD post-trial and to perform brain MRI scans.  However, given the findings to date, the increasing population dementia burden, and the need to study its causes using both classic epidemiologic methods and new technologies, we now propose a WHIMS Extension from July 1, 2008 - June 30, 2011 in order to fully leverage this unique resource.  

The WHIMS Extension objectives are to:
*	Enhance statistical power necessary to identify predictors of cognitive health and decline by increasing the total number of cases of cognitive impairment and probable dementia by about 40%
*	Perform repeat brain MRI scans to identify factors related to progression of brain atrophy and lesion volume  
*	Continue assessment of the adverse effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy on cognition
*	Serve as a national resource on which to build ancillary studies in collaboration with the greater scientific community

The current Steering Committee, including WHI investigators, Adjudications Committee, and an External Advisory Board of well qualified experts will continue to manage and advise the study.  
The WHIMS Extension will fund annual cognitive assessments and those participants who completed the initial MRI substudy in 2006-2007 will be invited back for a repeat MRI.
 
For reasons of minimizing participant burden in an elderly population, administrative efficiency, and cost containment, it's been decided to centralize the data collection within Wake Forest vs. the current method where the field centers collect these data. This will result in a cost reduction of approximately 60% compared with field center interviews. Cognitive data on consenting women will be obtained through telephone interviews by trained and certified staff. The proposed telephone-based protocol has been used successfully in other studies and proven to be a valid and cost-effective method for tracking changes in cognitive status, MCI, and PD. The telephone-based questionnaires closely replicate the results of face-to-face questionnaires currently used in WHIMS and have been validated in other studies.  Initial validation studies in WHIMS have confirmed their utility.  After a brief hearing screening test, participants will receive the widely-used Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) which is modeled after the Modified Mini-Mental Status questionnaire for screening.  The Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form and the WHI Insomnia Rating Scale for sleep disturbance will measure important covariates of cognitive performance.  Participants will also report use of cognition-related medications.  If a participant's TICS score falls below a cut-point, their pre-designated proxy (next-of-kin, family member, friend) will be contacted by telephone for the administration of the Dementia Questionnaire (DQ).  This combination of participant (TICS) and proxy data (DQ) mirrors the current WHIMS protocol and provides data for the adjudication of MCI and PD.  In addition, participants will receive the East Boston Memory Test for verbal memory, the Verbal Fluency-Animals test for verbal fluency, and the Digit-Span Test for working memory.  As in the current protocol, the telephone-based DQ will continue to be used to determine the dementia status of deceased participants or participants who have ceased full follow-up participation.

Wake Forest University and the two existing subcontractors that provide MRI readings and study coordination have the unique capability to provide these required services to the NHLBI for continuation of this study.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in continuing the study make competition unfeasible.  It is imperative that the existing logistical structure, the continuity of the study, and the integrity of study data be maintained.   Interested respondents must submit, within 45 days of this announcement, a written capability statement demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort on the same study participants.  Responses providing insufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is not a Request for Proposal.  See FedBizOpps Numbered Note 22.

The FMCSA will provide an overview of the WRI research program plans and next steps.  Specifically, FMCSA is interested in learning more about technology capabilities for: wireless communications and networks for WRI; collecting real time information on vehicle, driver, and cargo identification and status; and commercial vehicle telematics and fleet management systems.  FMCSA is also interested in feedback on the WRI program as a whole. FMCSA welcomes the participation in the session of the telecommunications industry, telematics and mobile resource management service providers, vehicle and equipment manufacturers, and motor carriers. 

The term "wireless roadside inspection" is defined as a process where authorized public sector entities (people and systems) examine the condition of the commercial motor vehicle and driver by assessing data collected by on-board systems. The data used in the assessment is termed the "Safety Data Message Set". The Safety Data Message Set (SDMS) will be delivered using wireless communications in real time to the public sector infrastructure. FMCSA?s WRI research program goals are to demonstrate the feasibility and to measure the value of utilizing new technologies (communications, sensors, telematics, etc.) to assess truck and bus drivers and vehicles significantly more often than is possible using today's approaches.  
The Workshop will include opportunities for technology provider participants to share information on their technologies, solutions and ongoing activities.  A meeting agenda will be posted in the coming weeks.  
Participation is open to all interested parties, but space will be limited. Parties in interested in attending, presenting, or having a display table must contact Mr. Jim Bunch of Noblis via email at jabunch@noblis.org or by phone at 202-863-2984 by January 10, 2008.  Reservations for attending, speaking, and table displays will be handled on a first come, first serve basis.  
A block of rooms have been reserved at the Sheraton Crystal City Hotel, Arlington VA 22202, 703-486-1111 located near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and the Crystal City Metrorail Station located along the blue and yellow subway lines.  Participants needing a hotel room must contact the hotel directly.

<SUBJECT>D -- PUBLIC ANNOUCEMENT
<DESC>PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT

STANDARD COMPETITION TENTATIVE DECISION ANNOUNCEMENT  

MAXWELL AFB SOFTWARE SERVICES FUNCTION 

The 42d Air Base Commander, Col. Peter Costello III, of AETC has announced a tentative performance decision of Software Services.  Competition between agency tender and contract performance determined Software Engineering Services, 1311 South Fort Crook Road, Suite 100, Bellevue NE, 68005  performance to be the most efficient and cost effective method of operation.  This competition affects a total of 30 DoD personnel 0 officers, 16 enlisted, 14 civilians, and 16 Contract Manpower Equivalents.  

This standard competition was conducted in compliance with the Air Force policies in AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, which implements the Office of Management and Budget Circular (OMBC) A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities.  This Circular reaffirms the Government?s policy to rely on the private sector for commercial products and services.  When in-house performance of commercial activities is not required for national defense reasons and contracting is more cost effective, conversion to contract performance is in the best interest of the American taxpayer.

When a competition between an agency and contract performance determines contracting is more cost effective, OMBC A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation require the contractor to offer adversely affected civilian and NAF employees the Right of First Refusal for employment openings to positions (under the contract) for which they are qualified.  Since DoD is sensitive to the personal impact this action may have on civilian employees, the DoD Program for Stability of Civilian Employment ensures every effort is made to help adversely affected civilian employees who desire placement assistance.  These employees may register in the Defense-wide computerized Priority Placement Program.  Registrants under this program receive placement rights to vacancies within DoD (other Federal agencies are also solicited).  When adversely affected civilian employees must relocate to continue Federal employment, transportation and moving expenses are paid by the Government.

located only on the network.  The client would like to increase the number of users who can use the network 
version of SPSS.  

SPSS has modules/components/add-on items that the client uses.  One component is Regression, but only one 
person can use this module at a time and the client would like to increase the number of users who can use it at 
any one time.   

The server and regression items must be compatible with Windows Server 2003 SP2 Standard Edition on the

1) More flexible user interface such as the ability to instantly resize dialog boxes to accommodate long variable 
names and lists and the ability to quickly drag and drop variables from one pane to another to set up your analysis.

2) Expanded analytical capabilities such as an integration plug-in that would enable users to access statistical routines created in R, free software for statistical computation and graphics.

3) Additional programmability enhancement such as a programmable integration plug-in that provides a link with configuration instructions that enables an SPSS syntax job to take advantage of an external programming language.

4) Enhanced data management and reporting capabilities such as:
?	The ability to change the string length or the data type of an existing variable using syntax.
?	The ability to define missing values and labels for data strings of any length.
?	Capability of choosing either rounding off or add decimal places to calculated dates when using the Date/Time Wizard.
?	Ability while in the Data Editor to find and replace information, spell check value and variable labels, sort within the Variable View, show/hide dictionary attributes.
?	Capability of finding and replacing text in syntax.
?	Ability to transfer data and SPSS output to and from Excel 2007.
?	Ability to suppress the number of active datasets that are open on the desktop.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
     (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
         (1)     The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
         (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 
         (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
         (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
         (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
         Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
         (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
         (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
         (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
         (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
         (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
         (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
         (d) Special rule for related partnerships.     For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
         (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Instructions to Offerors 

The provision at FAR 52.212-1-- Instructions to Offerors (Jan 2005) - Commercial Items apply to this acquisition. Proposals will be evaluated on past performance, key personnel, and price and price related factors. FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan. 1999) applies. 

Evaluation Criteria and Basis For Award

The Offeror's proposal shall contain a response to each of the factors identified below. The evaluation of this proposal will be based on the Technical and Price proposals submitted by the offeror. 

FACTOR 1: PAST PEFORMANCE 

The quality of an Offeror's past performance will be evaluated based on references provided by the Offeror, information the Government obtains through reference checks, and/or from other sources (to include but not be limited to other contracting offices, the Past performance Information retrieval Systems, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)). Offerors shall provide three (3) references for requirements of similar size, scope, and complexity to the acquisition of Light Deactivation in Support of the Applicant Sales Program. Contact information, phone numbers, facsimile numbers, and email addresses shall be provided and the offeror is responsible for ensuring accurate contact information is provided and encouraged to contact its references in advance to notify that they may be contacted by the evaluation team for this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to perform customer surveys only for those contracts which are deemed by the Government to be most relevant to this procurement. The past performance section shall be limited to six (6) pages. 

FACTOR 1 EVALUATION AND SCORING STANDARDS: 

Significant confidence: The Offeror's past performance record provides little doubt that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort or exceeds our requirement. 

Confidence: The Offeror's past performance record indicates the Offeror can successfully perform the required effort. 

Unknown confidence: The Offeror has no relevant performance record. A review was unable to identify any relevant past performance information. This is a neutral rating. It does not hinder nor help the Offeror. 

Little confidence: The Offeror's past performance record provides substantial doubt that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 

No confidence: The Offeror's past performance record provides extreme doubt that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 

FACTOR 2: KEY PERSONNEL Offerors will be evaluated on the ability of their key personnel to clearly demonstrate their understanding, knowledge, and experience to meet the requirements identified in this solicitation. In addition, proposed key personnel will be evaluated on their experience in past requirements. Offerors shall provide resumes which include a description of the experience and capability for the proposed key personnel. Descriptions shall address such items as the individual's background, education, work experience and accomplishments. Resumes shall also demonstrate the knowledge that key personnel have gained through completed and ongoing efforts that are similar in nature to this effort. At a minimum, the following positions will be considered key personnel: project manager, quality control manager, and technical manager. Each resume shall be limited to two (2) pages and one introductory page is allowed; therefore the key personnel section is limited to six (6) pages. 

FACTOR 2 EVALUATION AND SCORING STANDARDS: 

Superior: Offeror demonstrates excellent understanding of the requirement and the experience and capabilities of the proposed personnel significantly exceed performance or capability expectations. There are no significant weaknesses. 

Satisfactory: Offeror demonstrates good understanding of the requirement and the experience and capabilities of the proposed personnel meet the performance or capability expectations. There are no significant weaknesses. 

Marginal: Offeror demonstrates shallow understanding of the requirement and the experience and capabilities of the proposed personnel marginally meet performance or capability expectations necessary for minimal but acceptable contract performance. There are weaknesses that may be correctable. Continuous government oversight of the Offeror's proposed key personnel may be necessary in order to achieve performance requirements. 

Poor: Offeror fails to demonstrate understanding of the requirement and the experience and capabilities of the proposed personnel fail to meet performance or capability expectations. There are unacceptable weaknesses. Changes to the Offeror's proposed key personnel would be necessary in order to achieve performance requirements. 

FACTOR 3: PRICE AND PRICE RELATED FACTORS Offerors shall be evaluated on their ability to provide a sound competitive offer associated with the requirement identified within the solicitation. The proposed price will be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness, and realism as compared to Independent Government Estimate (IGE) and the prices proposed by other offerors. The offeror must reflect a clear understanding of the requirement, and must be consistent with the methods described in the offeror's proposal. There is no page limitation for the price section; however, extraneous or past performance and key personnel information included in the price section will not be evaluated.

(2)  QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
	(a)  Introduction 
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) was developed to evaluate Contractor actions while implementing this Performance-Based Work Statement. It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring Contractor performance for each listed objective. 
This QASP is based on the premise that the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in the provision of all necessary supplies and services to ensure a successful conference. 
The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for all management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government is to monitor quality assurance to ensure all contract standards are achieved. 
In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality. Under the terms of the contract, the Contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of self inspections and self monitoring of its actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the Contractor to success. 
Once the quality control program is approved by OPM, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust assurance program.

	
(b)  Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites. You may access FedTeDS via the following URL https://www.FedTeDS.gov.     You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled ?Register with FedTeDS? and then choosing the ?Vendor Registration Form? hyperlink. At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your Company's , CCR Point of Contact )your Company's DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number),Your Telephone Number and Your E-Mail Address.

Also, Beginning January 1, 2005, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) all vendors will be required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.     Potential offerors should refer to the solicitation package regarding instructions involving the use of ORCA.           

Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities website for amendments, if any, to the solicitation.

<SUBJECT>V -- SALES PROGRAM TRAILER DEACTIVATION
<SOLNBR>HSFELA-07-R-0044
<RESPDATE>072007
<CONTACT>Tisha Lee, Contract Specialist, Phone 225-334-7702, Fax 225-379-4027, Email tisha.lee@dhs.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to amend the description of requirements (Statement of Work) for the items to be required, add additional CLINS to provide for the transport of the various types of units, and provide responses to questions received in response to solicitation HSFELA-07-R-0044 as identified below.

Description of Requirements (Statement of Work) for the items to be required shall be amended as follows:

All references to "The contractor shall remove....." shall be amended to now read "The contractor shall remove and dispose......"

Schedule of Prices Shall Be Amended To Include the Following:  


Line Item    Item Description     Quantity    Unit    Price
   
Line 0004     Transportation of      1       Each    Unit Price
               Travel Trailer                

Line 0005     Transportation of      1       Each    Unit Price
            Mobile Home/Park Models


Questions and Answers

1.  How many trailers (units) are contained at each site?

We anticipate a firm fixed-price award of one (1) contract for each of the zones as previously identified in the solicitation.  An estimated total of units requiring deactivation in each zone is  identifed below.  

   Zone			Estimated Number of Units 
		        Requiring Deactivation

    1	                      3,117

    2	                      2,269

    3	                      2,950

    4	                      2,865

    5	                      2,578


2.  How long will the contractor have to deactivate each site?

The contractor performing deactivations will complete all work within thirty (30) days.

3.  Will the contractor be responsible for removing any fencing?

The contractor performing deactivations shall be responsible for removing any fencing that was placed on a private site by FEMA.  

4.  Will the contractor be responsible for the disposal of strapping and anchoring implements, blocking and debris associated with the unit installation? 

Yes, the contractor performing deactivations will be responsible for disposing of strapping and anchoring implements as well as blocking and debris in accordance with applicable codes, laws, and/or policies.

5.  If the contractor has to fill and tamper holes and ditches does the government have a preference in fill material

The contractor performing deactivations shall use equivalent materials using best commercial practices to restore the location to its previous condition.  

6.  Will these units be travel trailers, park models or mobile homes? 
        
The contractor performing deactivations will be responsible for deactivating travel trailers, park models, and mobile homes.

7.  Will an additional licenses be required if units are mobile homes or park models? 

Yes, licenses will be required for each type of unit.  

8.  Will units be deactivated to a staging yard in Louisiana or to another state? 

Delivery will be made to a designated FEMA location; which will not be a staging yard.  FEMA will designate other, local sites to move units to in order to conduct a transfer of the unit to the applicant.

9.  Who will be responsible for missing tires or damaged axles from the original installation? 
            
The contractor performing the light deactivations will be responsible for missing tires or damaged axles.

10. Who will be responsible for removing personal items left by the occupant.....indoor and outdoor? 

The contractor performing the light deactivations will be responsible for removal of outdoor items as it applies to the obstruction of a unit.  IA-Housing or the department that is coordinating the move out inspections (MOI) will be responsible for the removal of indoor items.   

11. Will some of these units have bladders and if so what size and who is responsible for removing and disposal? 

The contractor performing the light deactivations will be responsible for the removal and disposal if a bladder exists.  The size of each bladder will vary.

12. Will another line item be issued to reflect the cost difference for transporting a travel trailer
vs. a mobile home?

Yes, additional CLINS will be added to provide for the transport of park models/mobile homes and travel trailers.

13. Will there be any bonding requirements for this contract?  

There are no bonding requirements for this contract.

14.  CLIN 0003
    
Each aspect of a deactivation is broken out into seperate CLINs.  The description of each of these CLINs references the "de-energizing" or "disconnecting" of power sources.  I presume that the reference in this description means the coordination of the LA One Call? 

The LA One Call deals with excavating and digging. This call has no bearing on the the de-energizing or disconnecting of power sources. 

CLIN 0003 "Utility Removal" states that the removal of power poles may be part of this requirement.  It has been our experience that it often takes up to several weeks for the utility companies to de-energize the power to a pole, often well after the unit has been removed from the property.  If we will be required to go back to the property to retrieve the pole after it has been deactivated, at what point precisely will this CLIN be considered completed and billable?

The CLINs are to be individually priced as each light deactivation may not require all CLINs.  Work will be considered billable upon completion of all work authorized and completed for each unit.

15.   Storage of Units and Materials    

Will units be delivered directly to a FEMA staging yard from the removal site or must they be cleaned (and possibly be stored briefly by us) prior to being accepted at FEMA staging? The need to maintain our own staging areas will obviously affect our pricing and possibly the areas for which we are able to bid the work.

Delivery will be made to a designated FEMA location; which will not be a staging yard.  FEMA will designate other, local sites to move units to in order to conduct a transfer of the unit to the applicant.  Any cleaning prior to removal will be performed by the Maintenance and Deactivation Contractor.

I understand that the actual transportation of units is to be bid on a per mile basis.  However, if units are to be delivered across state lines (e.g., into Mississippi), there are additional permits and insurance requirements which could affect our costs and therefore our pricing.  Will there be interstate lines crossed?

Units will not be delivered across state lines.

Also, what are we to do with the materials removed?  Though these materials technically belong to FEMA, we have been told not to bring them to FEMA staging for the current deactivations we are doing for other FEMA contractors.  Will we need to store these materials or discard them?  If we need to discard them, please advise as to any special requirements for their disposal (e.g., hazardous waste).

The materials removed shall be discarded in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and/or policies.

16.  INVOICING

Though broken out into seperate CLINs, all of the work to be performed in connection with deactivations really happens as part of one overall process, other than going back to retrieve the power pole after de-energization.  At what point/how frequently will we be permitted to invoice FEMA for this work?  Waiting for weeks to invoice and then to receive money from FEMA for this work creates a hardship when having to "float" the money to our independent contractors.  Is there any possibility of receiving some start up capital of help offset these expenses?

The CLINs are to be individually priced as each light deactivation may not require all CLINs.  Work will be considered billable upon completion of all work authorized and completed for each unit.  Phase-in costs are not being considered as part of this procurement, and any such expenses should be distributed into the firm-fixed price for each CLIN.

If the contract awardee wishes to make a separate public announcement, the awardee must obtain the approval of the Contracting Officer prior to releasing the announcement, and must plan to make announcement only after the contract has been awarded.

If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contacting Office, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

	(d)	The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer.

	(4)	The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.

OPM-8 	Special Requirements for Employing Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans  			   [FAR 22.13]

<SUBJECT>66 -- Vacuum Compatible Linear Actuator System

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address a question posed about the specifications for the Vacuum Compatible Linear Actuator System.

The question is:   "We ask what is the minimum step that the item needs to be?"

The response is:  I will assume that the vendor is asking about the resolution.  The resolution is the smallest travel displacement that I want to be able to detect once the actuator is in motion. The answer to the question is in specification (b) less than 10 nanometers per count resolution.  We are looking for a DC motor (not a stepper motor). An encoder outputs counts as the motor turns. Gears and a screw convert the rotation of the motor into travel. When the actuator moves 10 nanometers, the encoder should output at least one count.

All terms and conditions in the combined solicitation/synopsis, including deadline for submission of quotes, remain unchanged.
