PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND FUNDING
The mission of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop those technologies into important, radically new military capabilities.  In addition, DSO is looking for research ideas and areas that might lead to innovations in science and engineering.  To this end, DSO is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below. 
Proposals may be either basic or applied research.  However, in all cases, proposers should demonstrate that their proposed effort is aimed at high-risk/high-payoff technologies that have the potential for making, in the 5-10 year timeframe, revolutionary rather than incremental improvements to national security, including emerging threats and operational challenges.   Proposals that are not within the topical areas described below may be considered out of scope and may not be evaluated.  Likewise, proposals for the integration of existing technologies or development of systems will also be considered out of scope and will not be evaluated.  
Multiple awards are anticipated.  The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.  While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposers include a Phase I of 12 to 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. 
This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this research and development be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.  
TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS OF INTEREST TO DSO
This section describes the general technical interests of DSO.  Please note that while the topics are organized by traditional disciplines, interdisciplinary proposals are encouraged.  Regardless of the technical area, the ultimate success of a proposal is based on the specific technical idea(s) advanced within these areas and especially the uniqueness of the proposed approach.  Consequently, proposing within one of these topic areas is not sufficient to make a compelling case for funding.  For this reason, white papers are strongly suggested before submitting a full proposal.  (See “White Paper Submissions” below) 
New Materials, Materials Concepts, Materials Processing and Devices:
Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: 
Demonstrations of multifunctional (structure + function) materials;
Demonstrations of smart materials and structures;
Novel approaches for manufacturing and self-assembly of materials and structures;
Engineered materials and material systems with designed structure and morphology  (e.g., meta-materials);

Investigation of the interactions between physical forces, materials and biology (e.g., interface of biology with magnetics);
Novel mathematical and computational approaches to characterizing and simulating complex biological processes; 
New technologies to drastically reduce the logistics burden of medical treatment in the field;
Advanced signal processing techniques for the decoding of neural signals in real time, specifically those associated with operationally relevant cognitive events, including target detection, errors, and other decision-making processes; 
Novel interface and sensor designs for interacting with the central (cortical and subcortical structures) and peripheral nervous systems, with a particular emphasis on non-invasive and/or non-contact approaches;
New approaches for understanding and predicting the behavior of individuals and groups, especially those that elucidate the neurobiological basis of behavior and decision making; and
Technologies to engineer field medical therapies at the point of care, such as production of multiple drugs from a single pro-drug, or to adapt therapies for wide variations in body mass, metabolism, or physiologic stress.

Novel Technologies to Improve the Human Consequences of Transformation:
Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
New approaches for training individuals and teams, including embedded training and simulation;
Understanding and improving team performance; and
New approaches to improve rapid decision-making in chaotic or data-poor environments.
 
Special Focus Areas
From time to time, DARPA will publish addenda to this BAA that will highlight particular areas of interest.  It is highly recommended that potential proposers look periodically for these updates.  Addenda will have deadlines for submission of white papers and proposals that are different from the deadline in this BAA.  Under addenda, the technical content for a submission as well as the overall structure of the proposed effort may also differ.  DARPA will not establish a distribution list for automatic distribution of these addenda.  Any specific instructions or criteria in a published addendum will take precedence over this BAA in response to that addendum only.  
Other Technical Areas
Ideas outside of the advertised focus areas will be considered in scope only if the proposers can demonstrate that they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the technical interests of the office.  Proposals that integrate existing technologies or products into systems generally do not fall within the purview of DSO and are likely to be rejected.  
WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS
Before proposers put together a full proposal, it is highly recommended (though not required) that they submit a white paper in response to the BAA.  This white paper should clearly state the uniqueness of the idea presented in the context of existing state of the art in the technical area of interest.  Demonstrating that the proposer has a clear understanding of the state of the art and that their proposed effort will make significant improvements therein is essential for a successful proposal.  The white paper should also describe the proposed approach and explain why it is unique.  Further, the proposer should demonstrate an understanding of the payoff of the technical idea, especially in terms of how it might make a difference to Defense capabilities.  Key milestones expected in the effort should be described.  Also, a brief discussion of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members should be provided.  Finally, an estimate of the program costs and duration should be included.  White papers should not be longer than 8 pages; however, shorter white papers that can cover the content above are strongly encouraged.
A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0619/ has been set up to facilitate the submission of white papers.  This site will allow proposers to fill in contact information and upload a white paper document in either Word or PDF format.  It will provide a method by which proposers can track their submissions.  White paper submissions may also be made by attachment to an e-mail sent to BAA06-19@darpa.mil (Word 97 or higher is recommended).  Embedded text and Postscript are also acceptable.  Note:  If the website is not used, then the body of the e-mail and the attachment must include name, mailing address, phone number, and fax number of the proposer.  If this information is not contained in the body, the e-mail will be returned for inclusion of that information.  (If proposers choose not to use e-mail, U.S. mail may be used.  White papers and proposals will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.)  Within two weeks of receipt of the white paper, the proposer will receive a confirmation providing a log number and both a technical and administrative point of contact.  The formal recommendation about whether a full proposal is recommended will be made as soon as possible.  However, the exact time for response will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the number of white papers received.  Procedures have been put in place that will help proposers to rapidly determine the applicability of their white paper to DARPA/DSO and to help develop promising ideas into formal proposals with a reasonably high probability of funding.  Proposers may recommend a program manager to review their proposals based on prior discussions and/or information on the DSO website.  Please note, this recommendation and any additional feedback provided is for the benefit of the proposer and following these recommendations is not a guarantee that the full proposal will be funded.  All full proposal submissions will be evaluated regardless of the disposition of the white paper.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION AND DEADLINES
Proposals may be submitted and received at any time until the final proposal deadline of 4:00 PM EST February 9, 2007.  Proposals will be evaluated against the criteria set forth in this solicitation, and an proposer will be notified either that: (1) the proposal has been selected for funding, or (2) the proposal has not been selected for funding.  Proposers may elect to have their proposal withdrawn from consideration at any time during the evaluation process.  If a formal request is not made, DARPA will assume that continued evaluation is desired.  One copy only of proposals that are not selected for funding will be retained for administrative purposes.  
The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, including those that do not strictly adhere to the division of technical and cost sections.  The Government also reserves the right to fund proposals in phases with options for continued work at the end of one or more of the phases.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or "Other Transaction," depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  The proposer must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the Government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS Part 227).
FORMAT AND CONTENT OF FULL PROPOSAL
The descriptions contained in this section are to help proposers ensure that proposals have sufficiently detailed information to be evaluated.  Proposals not conforming to the instructions of this section may not, at the discretion of the Government, be evaluated.  Full proposals shall consist of two volumes, technical and cost.  A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0619 has been established to facilitate the submission of full proposals electronically.  This site will allow proposers to fill in contact information and upload a full proposal created with the requirements listed below in either Word or PDF format.  Note:  if the website is not used, please use the U.S. mail system or the BAA e-mail account BAA06-19@darpa.mil.  If submitting via e-mail, the body of the e-mail and the attachment must include name, mailing address, phone number, and fax number of the proposer.  If this information is not contained in the body, the e-mail will be returned for inclusion of that information.  If proposers choose to submit by U.S. mail, they should submit one (1) original and three (3) copies of the full proposal to the address shown below.  Proposals will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.  Both volumes should be included as a single document when uploading to the website.
Volume 1: Technical. 
The technical volume is limited to a maximum of 30 pages including all figures, references, tables, charts, cover sheet, and appendices and consists of the following sections: 
a)	Executive Summary (two pages or less);
b)	Technical section that clearly describes the innovation of the work to be accomplished, specific metrics for the effort, the risks to achieving those metrics and approaches for mitigation of those risks.  All milestones should be clearly delineated, especially those early (12 to 18 months) milestones that are critical to demonstration of the concept or approach.  Supporting rationale for performance enhancements should be included.  The perceived need for this research and the potential impact on the DoD should be described, and a Statement of Work (SOW) that summarizes critical tasks to be accomplished should be presented;
c)	Time-phased schedule-milestone chart;
d)	Summary of relevant prior work;
e)	Brief description of applicable facilities and equipment; 
f)	Short resumes of key individuals.  The level of effort and specific roles and qualifications of key individuals should be included.  If the team is large (greater than 3 separate entities), a management plan for coordination of the effort should also be included; and
g)	Current and pending support (award title, amount, period of performance, and degree of overlap with this proposal).
Proposers are cautioned not to submit supporting material (articles, CDs, etc.) as these will not be used in evaluation of the proposal.   
Volume 2: Cost. 
The cost volume shall contain the following: 
a)	Cover sheet to include: (1) BAA number; (2) Technical area; (3) Lead organization submitting proposal; (4) Type of business (Lead organization), selected among the following categories: “LARGE BUSINESS,” “SMALL BUSINESS,” “SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS,” “8A,” “OTHER SMALL BUSINESS,” “EMERGING SMALL BUSINESS,” “VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS,” “SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN OWNED,” “OTHER VETERAN,” “WOMAN-OWNED BUSINESS,” “HUBZONE,” “JWOD PARTICIPATING NONPROFIT AGENCY,” “OTHER NONPROFIT,” “HOSPITAL,” “ FOREIGN CONCERN OR ENTITY,” “DOMESTIC FIRM PERFORMING OUTSIDE U.S.,” “HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY (HBCU),” “MINORITY INSTITUTION (MI),” “OTHER EDUCATIONAL”; (5) Contractor’s reference number (if any); (6) Other team members (if applicable) and type of business for each; (7) Proposal title; (8) Technical point of contact to include: salutation, last name, first name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available), electronic mail (if available); (9) Administrative point of contact to include: salutation, last name, first name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available), and electronic mail (if available); (10) Award instrument requested: cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF); cost-contract--no fee; cost sharing contract--no fee; or other type of procurement contract (specify), grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction; (11) Place(s) and period(s) of performance; (12) Total proposed cost separated by basic award and option(s) (if any); (13) Name, address, and telephone number of the proposer’s cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) administration office or Office of Naval Research; (14) Name, address, and telephone number of the proposer’s cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit office; (15) Date proposal was prepared; (16) DUNS, TIN, CAGE CODE; and (17) All subcontractors’ proposal backup documentation to include items 1-16 above, as applicable and available.
b)	Detailed cost breakdown to include:  (1) total program cost broken down by major cost items (direct labor, subcontracts, materials, travel, other direct costs, overhead charges, etc.), and (2) an itemization of major subcontracts (labor, travel, materials and other direct costs) and equipment purchases.  Where the effort consists of multiple portions that could reasonably be partitioned for purposes of funding, these should be identified as options with separate cost estimates for each.
c)	Supporting cost and pricing information in sufficient detail to substantiate the summary cost estimates in b) above.  Include a description of the method used to estimate costs and supporting documentation.  Note:  “cost or pricing data” as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 2.101 shall be required if the proposer’s proposal is for a procurement contract award of $550,000 or greater unless the proposer requests an exception from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data.  “Cost or pricing data” is not required if the proposer proposes an award instrument other than a procurement contract (e.g., a grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction).  The requirements for submission of “cost or pricing data” are specified in FAR Subpart 15.403-4 (see http://www.arnet.gov/far).
OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION
Teaming and Team Composition
Teaming is encouraged, especially when interdisciplinary approaches to a problem are required.
Proposals may include, or be led by, foreign firms and/or personnel provided all export control laws and U.S. national security requirements are adhered to in the conduct of the effort and that the work relating to the foreign firm or personnel is unclassified.  The onus of understanding and complying with export control rests with the proposer, not the Government.
Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HBCU, and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. 
Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  Consequently, all proposers and proposed subcontractors must, therefore, affirm whether they are providing scientific, engineering and technical assistance (SETA) or similar support to any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the proposer supports, and identify the prime contract numbers.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined at FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the proposer has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.
Technology Transition
Proposals that have currently identifiable commercial or military end-product are strongly encouraged to engage commercial and military end-users and commercial manufacturers.  The engagement of these communities also helps ensure that the various technologies being developed will be commercially viable (cost effective, manufacturability, etc.) and available to the military.  Thus, proposals are strongly encouraged to include/involve the user-community that intends to bring the technology to practice as a result of this research.  This relationship encourages the participation of researchers, end-users and manufacturers as collective contributors to the technology definition, implementation, and performance evaluation.
Proprietary Information
All proprietary information should be marked on both the white paper and the full proposal.  It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.  Standard proprietary disclaimers notwithstanding, proposals may be reviewed by non-Government technical experts who have signed a nondisclosure agreement with DARPA, unless the specific phrase “TO BE REVIEWED BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ONLY” appears on the cover sheet.  In any case, personnel under exclusive contract with DARPA who have completed the appropriate nondisclosure agreements will handle the proposals for administrative purposes. 
Guidance for Classified Information and Data
The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under a BAA will be unclassified.  In the event that a proposer chooses to submit a classified proposal, the following information is applicable.
Proposals and white papers may contain classified information or data (up to the level of Top Secret/SCI). HOWEVER, DO NOT SEND CLASSIFIED WHITE PAPERS OR FULL PROPOSALS BY EMAIL OR VIA ONLINE SUBMISSION SYSTEMS.  Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their proposals should contact DARPA security at (571) 218-4842 (or alternatively, the point-of-contact for this BAA) for guidance and direction in advance of proposal preparation.  Proposers must have existing approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose.
Security Classification guidance on DD Form 254 will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award.  Proposers choosing to submit a classified proposal must first receive permission from the Original Classification Authority to use their information in applying to this BAA.  An applicable classification guide should be submitted to ensure that the proposal is protected appropriately.  For instructions on submitting Classified White Papers or Full Proposals, contact Security & Intelligence Directorate (SID) Classification Management at (571) 218-4842.
Research Involving Human Use
Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (http://www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the DoD Directive 3216.2 (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm).  All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects.  This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and Federal Wide Assurances.  These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort.
For proposals involving “greater than minimal risk” to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a federally approved IRB at the time of final proposal submission to DARPA.  For proposals that are forecasted to involve “greater than minimal risk” after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission.  More information on applicable Federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).
EVALUATION CRITERIA
Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal
using the following criteria:
Scientific and Technical Merit of the Proposal
Proposers must demonstrate that their proposal is innovative and unique, that the technical approach is sound, that they have an understanding of critical technical issues and risk, and that they have a plan for mitigation of those risks.  A significant improvement in capability or understanding above the state of the art must be demonstrated.  All milestones must be clearly and quantitatively described.
Value to Defense
Proposers must demonstrate the potential of successful research to radically change military capability or improve national security with a clear statement of the goals of their program and a quantitative comparison with existing technology.
Capability of the Personnel and Facilities to Perform the Proposed Effort
Proposers must demonstrate that their team has the necessary background and experience to perform this project.  The balance of the technical capabilities of the team must match that required in the program plan.  The relevant experience of key personnel must be sufficient to provide confidence that the proposers can accomplish their objectives.  Proposers must demonstrate that the combined facilities of the team are sufficient to accomplish the objectives of the proposal.
Cost Realism
Costs of the proposal must be reasonable and provide a high value to the Government.

<CONTACT>Steven Perry, 3097821088
<DESC>NA Estimated draft solicitation issue date is August 5, 2002.  Estimated closing date of draft solicitation is August 20, 2002.  Estimated final solicitation issue date is September 10, 2002. Estimated final solicitation closing date is October 10, 2002.  The  U.S. Army is in the process of modernizing all Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKOs).  Each SKO consists of a wide variety of tools and equipment essential to providing support to the Army’s inventory of technologically advanced tactical and combat support weapon  systems to meet the Army’s Ordnance and Combat missions.  This process is incremental.  With the completion of each redesign, each SKO will be procured and fielded. The Army is soliciting proposals from large and small businesses to establish long-term Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contracts for various tool sets, kits and outfits (SK0s).  It is the Army’s intent to make multiple awards under this solic itation to both large and small businesses.  Individual delivery orders will be competed among all awardees unless it is determined that a specific delivery order should be competed exclusively among small business awardees.  The Army will follow the Feder al Acquisition Regulation's  “rule of two” in determining whether a specific delivery order is to be competed among small business awardees (See FAR 19.502(b)). SKO's are defined as:   	Sets:  a collection of tools/components used by a group, section, squad, platoon or unit usually supplemented by tool kits to perform an organizational mission. Unit of issue of Set (SE) 	Kits:  An assembly of tools/components in a small pouch or box designed for use and carried by an individual or crew. Unit of issue of Kit (KT) 	Outfits: An assemblage of tools or equipment.  May include separately type-classified items as a component such as: Pneumatic Tool and Compressor Outfit, Water Purification Outfit, Tool Outfit Hydraulic Systems Repair and Tool Outfit Pioneer Portable Elec tric Tools. Unit of issue of Outfit (OT). For your information, Army Tools are defined as an instrument, implement, utensil, device or machine, powered or hand operated, used in diagnosis, making operating adjustments, performing damage or fault repair and preventive maintenance of Army material. In order to promote competition this requirement has been divided into the following segments: 1. Mechanical Maintenance Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final u se in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 2. Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final use in a  single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 3. Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools, measuring tools and equipment, or special-purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical maintenance or building trades.  These kits may be housed  in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 4. Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit i n a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually some of the components o f a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 5. Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually some of the components of the shop set are permanently mounted to its “carrier” by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to carry wartime operations. Each segment will be individually competed and awarded.  The Army intends to establish two award pools for each segment: one will be created under full and open competition and the other will be for small business concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more segments.  Each segment shall require offerors to submit a technical, performance risk and price proposal based on a sample SKO requirement.  The Army reserves the right to issue a delivery order on the sample SKO proposals.  The Army further reserves the right to issue an order under the award pool established under full and open competition or the award pool of small business concerns, depending upon proposals received. Small business concerns may compete for the award pool to be established under full and open competition and the pool to be established exclusively for small business concerns.  Small business concerns may submit alternative proposals based on meeting or n ot meeting the non-manufacturers rule (see 13 CFR 121.406).  Proposals based on meeting the non-manufacturers rule must be supported by adequate documentation. Offerors not receiving an award to be included in a pool of awardees will be debriefed and will have an opportunity to file a protest.

<DESC>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Service Center intends to  award an interim or â€œbridgeâ€ supplemental agreement to contract  DE-AC52-05NA26345 for a period of seven months for security protective  force  services and other security-related services for the NNSA Nevada Site  Office  (NSO).   The services will be performed at the Nevada Test Site; Las  Vegas, NV  area NNSA/NSO facilities; contractor facilities; and other designated  facilities.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open  competition is 41 U.S.C. 253Â©(1), implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a), which  authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one  responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency  requirements.  The interim supplemental agreement is required pending  completion of two competitive follow-on acquisitions:  a full and open  competition for Security Protective Force Services (solicitation No.  DE-RP52-05NA14390) and a small business set-aside for Security System  Services  (solicitation No. DE-RP52-05NA99344).  Contract DE-AC52-05NA26345 with  Wackenhut Services, Inc. (WSI) will end on 28 February 2006.  No other  firm has  the requisite knowledge and experience to perform these highly specialized  security services without interruption on 1 March 2006.  WSI has the  requisite  number of key and non-key personnel possessing the required security  clearances.  This unique working environment necessitates the award of an  interim supplemental agreement to the incumbent contractor, WSI.  The  intent of  this sole source procurement is to provide the required support services  from 1  March 2006 until the award and/or transition of the follow-on  acquisitions.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is responsible for reducing the personal and property losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes.  Many sources of information are needed to permit researchers to adequately measure the characteristics of the highway safety environment.  NHTSA’s National Center for Statistics and Analysis (NCSA) operates a system of crash research teams; which provide detailed nationally representative statistics on motor vehicle crashes and a data base for evaluation of standards and for countermeasures design.  The name of this system is National Automotive Sampling System (NASS).  NASS is composed of two sub-systems, Crashworthiness Data System (CDS) and General Estimates System (GES).  CDS focuses on the crashworthiness of passenger cars, light trucks, and vans which;were towed because of damage, whereas, GES collects limited data on other highway crashes in order to produce general estimates.  From 1991 until 2004, CDS has included 24 Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) located in 17 states and two quality control Zone Centers.  The GES includes an additional 36 PSUs located in 9 additional states.  In 2005, CDS will increase to 27 PSUs located in 17 states and GES will decrease to 33 PSUs located in 9 additional states.  Each PSU team collects certain information from traffic-police crash reports (PARs), which will be used to generate estimates of the nation’s highway crash experience.  Crash investigations are often required in collecting information.  The investigation of each case includes interviewing drivers and occupants, inspecting scenes and vehicles, reviewing official medical reports and reconstructing crash dynamics.  Each contractor (two contracts will be awarded under this solicitation) is responsible for operating the crash research teams, maintaining the quality of the field research data, and providing technical guidance for each PSU within its Zone Center.  This procurement will provide for continued crash research, quality control and technical guidance by Zone Centers # 1 and #2 for the Crashworthiness Data System and General Estimates System of NASS.  



The period of performance is five (5) years with a six (6) month transition period.  Electronic copies of the RFP and any other documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site or URL for the FedBizOpps page is www.fedbizopps.gov or the GSA Electronic Posting Service at http://www.fbo.gov.  It is the Offeror’s responsibility to monitor the Internet sites for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Requests for paper copies of the RFP will not be accepted.  Estimated date for release of solicitation is on or about February 28, 2006.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Counter Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) System Program Office (SPO) is to develop and test countermeasures to combat the threat of shoulder-fired missiles against commercial aircraft.  The SPO has entered into agreements with two contractor teams to study, modify, and utilize existing DoD countermeasures technologies in the civilian airline environment.

The SPO needs the assistance of highly specialized individuals with significant experience in developing and administering Other Transaction (OT) Agreements as well as addressing individual issues that arise from the use of this flexible authority, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, foreign access, teaming, management, and acquisition planning. 

The remarkable speed at which the Counter-MANPADS program is progressing and the requirements and deadlines placed upon the program by Congress requires quick reactions and decisions by the SPO and DHS.  The use of sensitive DoD technologies in the commercial environment as well as the interactions with the commercial airline industry, both domestic and foreign, have and will continue to generate highly delicate and complex issues that must be handled under the umbrella of the OT agreements. The specialized expertise and assistance is imperative to give the SPO and DHS a full understanding of the ramification of these individual issues that will arise during the course of the program and will assist the SPO and the Agency in making rapid and informed decisions. 

The DHS Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) intends to make a sole source award to Diane M. Sidebottom for Specialized Acquisition Support.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c) (1) implement by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”.

<DESC>CDC, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory located in Pittsburgh intends to negotiate with Particle Instruments, LLC to procure for a Standard 10 lpm ELPl-01; ELPl Electrical Filter Stage; Vaccuum Hose (1.5m) pressure value & NW16 flange connectors; SV25BVaccuum Pump and 10, 20, 30 lpm impactor; Dekati sintered metal collection plate set; impactor collection plate set; aluminum foils; polycarbonate collection foils; Dekati 22mm stencil; Dekati collection substrate spray and mobile rack for ELP1 + pump.  The ELP1 measures particle size distribution and concentration of aerosols in the range from 7 to 10000 nanometers in diameter in real time.  By placing sampling media (filters, e.g.) on each stage, the particle chemistry, morphology and mass can subsequently be determined for each stage, simultaneously with either aerodynamic diameter or aerosol charge level.  The chemistry, morphology and mass measurements are time-averaged over the sampling period, not real-time determinations. The supplied software runs on a user-provided PC, allowing for data acquisition, display in real time and basic analysis, as well as control of instrument parameters. The instrument can be used in the lab or in the field.  Firms that believe they can provide the required equipment are encouraged to identify themselves and give written product information to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of this synopsis.  A determination not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  If the agency determines to compete this requirement, a RFQ will be issued solely to the responders of this notice and a subsequent presolicitation notice will not be issued.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract.  Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov.  Please address all inquiries to Margaret L. Mooney at CDC/PGO/AAFB/Pittsburgh, (412)386-6431 or E-mail zia3@cdc.gov.  All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered by the agency.

The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Flight Vehicle Integration Branch (AFRL/MNAV) is interested in receiving white papers for the Dual Role Air Dominance Missile-Technology (DRADM-T) Program under this Special Amendment to the Armament Technology Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) MNK-BAA-06-0001, Research Area 1 – Flight Vehicles Integration Research.  The DRADM-T program is one part of a coordinated set of technology development programs being initiated by AFRL/MN to enable the capabilities envisioned under the Air Supremacy Integrating Concept (ASIC).  The goal of the ASIC is to develop the technologies needed for a next-generation, dual-role munition capability to gain total control of the airspace, allowing friendly air assets to operate freely without fear of attack.  This is being accomplished by focusing on the technical challenges of detecting, identifying, engaging, and defeating broad classes of airborne threats and a limited set of ground-based enemy air defenses before they have a similar opportunity. Targets for the ASIC include adversary fixed winged aircraft, rotorcraft, unmanned air vehicles, cruise missiles, and active air defense systems (Suppression Enemy Air Defense/Destruction Enemy Air Defense SEAD/DEAD). This IC supports Global Strike CONOPS (Anti-Access), Global Persistent Attack CONOPS and Homeland Security CONOPS by providing a single missile for use against extremely agile air targets and SEAD ground targets.  This missile will provide a first-look, first-shot, first-kill capability, more precision, and an expanded target set for both within-visual-range and beyond-visual-range engagements.  The challenge is to design a robust suite of technologies that will integrate into a low-cost solution.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC intends to extend Contract NAS4-99030, Aircraft Logistics Support Services, for three months and three one-month options. The incumbent contractor, Kay and Associates, Inc. currently provides maintenance, modification, and support services for approximately 1200 pieces of Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE). Associated services provided include Shuttle mission staffing, operation and maintenance of Shuttle Support Equipment; training of personnel on special purpose vehicles and flight line driving; maintenance of GSA, utility, and NASA owned vehicles; and technical liaison services. NASA/DFRC intends to procure these services from Kay and Associates, Inc. of Buffalo Grove, Illinois. The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements”. A separate competitive follow-on procurement is being conducted at this time however it will not be completed in time to prevent a lapse in service. A lapse in the services provided by this contract would prevent DFRC from completing its mission. The services include the maintenance and upgrade of unique aircraft ground support items and special-purpose NASA-owned vehicles not normally found in non-research flight operations. The incumbent is in possession of the requisite knowledge, skills, and experience required, which will ensure continuous services during the interim extension period. Award to any other source would result in failure to meet the Agency's requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SOLNBR>PR-CI-06-10265
<CONTACT>GARRY A. PLEAR, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2054, E-Mail: Plear.Garry@epa.gov; SANDRA V. SAVAGE, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 513-487-2046, E-Mail: Savage.Sandra@epa.gov
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990  The U.S. EPA has a requirement for technical and economic analysis support for regulation of motor vehicles, engines, fuels and fuel additives for the EPA?s Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ).  OTAQ has responsibilities under the Clean Air Act (CAA) which include setting emission standards for on-and off-highway motor vehicles/engines and assuring compliance with such standards; characterizing emissions and fuel consumption characteristics of current and prototype on-and off-highway motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines; and assessing the effectiveness of cost of current or potential future motor vehicle emission control systems.  Additional OTAQ responsibilities include regulating motor vehicle fuels and  fuel additives (F/FA) and assessing the emissions characteristics of current or potential future motor vehicle F/FA.  Additional OTAQ efforts include encouraging the use of clean fuel vehicles and furthering the implementation of programs and technology aimed at reducing mobile source emissions and fuel consumption.  The objective of this solicitation is to provide OTAQ with flexible engineering and economic analytical support for regulations development and related activities such as emissions characterization, technology assessment and test procedure and/or equipment development.   Support for these activities shall include engineering/cost assessment of emissions and emission-control systems for both currently-controlled and uncontrolled emissions; analysis/modeling of F/FA regulatory issues such as fuel composition, production and distribution questions and the effects of changes in F/FA formulations on emissions.  Also included are environmental/air quality analysis and modeling to determine air quality, health, welfare and safety effects associated with compliance with new emission standards or other applicable CAA provisions; economic analysis and modeling; and safety and/or risk analysis.  Many of these activities will require the capability to conduct statistical analyses.  Fuels include conventional, reformulated and alternative motor fuels, as well as additives currently used or likely to be used in these fuels.   Significant potential exists for conflicts of interest (COI) under this procurement.  Therefore, it is considered in the best interest of the Government to preclude from award consideration as a prime contractor or subcontractor, all motor vehicle manufacturers and engine/non-road engine manufacturers and fuels and/or fuel additives producers.  The solicitation/contract shall also contain the clause ?Limitation of Future Contracting? which shall state that unless Contracting Officer approval is obtained, the contractor agrees not to enter into any type of business or financial relationship with or represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to the specific activities performed under this contract.   Specifically, enter into any type of business or financial relationship or represent motor vehicle manufacturers and engine/non-road engine manufacturers and fuels and/or fuel additives producers that are affected by the policy and regulations generated from this contract if the purpose is to shield or protect the company from adhering to EPA?s regulations or policies.  These restrictions apply during the life of the contract.  The Government anticipates award of a cost plus fixed fee term (LOE) contract with a twelve-month base term and four (4) twelve month options to extend the term.  The base level of effort for each term will consist of 12,000 option amounts of 100% for the Base and the option periods, which brings the maximum total potential on the contract to 120,000 direct labor hours over five (5) years.  The solicitation is subject to full and open competition, all responsive offerors may submit a proposal.  Copies of the solicitation will be available to all offerors on the Internet.  Offerors should visit EPA CP0D Home Page (http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd)  for ontinuous update of RFP?s status.  No RFP release date and closure have yet been established.  Anticipated release is March 2006.  All questions should be directed to Garry Plear via email at Plear.Garry@epa.gov or via telephone at (513)487-2054.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to extend the term of the Department of Treasury Communications System (TCS) contract No. TIRNO-95-D-00099 to Northrop Grumman Information Technology, Inc. for 6 months and one twelve month option period pending the competitive award of the follow-on contract.  The TCS contract, after exercising FAR 52.217-8, will expire March 27, 2006.  The Department of Treasury does not anticipate award and complete transition of all sites before this contract expires.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Department of Treasury has a continuing need for Wide Area Network (WAN) communications capabilities.  The extension of the TCS contract allows for uninterrupted Wide Area Network (WAN) communications capabilities for the Department of Treasury.  This extension enables Treasury to mitigate risks to the nation’s financial infrastructure and allow for successful transition to the follow-on contract.  This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids.  The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action.  If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.

<DESC>The Agency fro Health Research and Quality  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the National Business Coalition on Health, Washington, DC.  

Purpose:

During the past eighteen months AHRQ has worked with the National Business Coalition on Health (NBCH) and The Lewin Group to identify and assist three local coalitions to improve the quality of diabetes care in their communities.  Leaders in business, managed care, health facilities and clinicians in Baltimore, MD; Memphis, TN and Detroit, MI, have each developed projects to improve the care provided to patients with diabetes which are unique to their coalition needs and the capabilities of their collective organizations.  They are drawing on the knowledge, research evidence, information and tools available from AHRQ to support and sustain these initiatives, including the National Healthcare Quality Report (NHQR), the AHRQ publication “Diabetes Care Quality Improvement: A Resource Guide for State Action,” AHRQ staff for expert advice, work planning and meeting planning, and new tools developed by Lewin under contract with AHRQ.   
During 2006 NBCH will be ready to spread the knowledge and tools gained in these pilot project sites to more communities through their 98 member coalitions.  
The purpose of the initial project was to engage business coalitions to address improvements in care for diabetes for their beneficiaries and the communities at large.  NBCH was engaged to recruit members of their coalition for the project and to provide guidance for the project.  The next phase of the project, included in this contract, is focused on widening the scope of coalitions involved in the project.  NBCH is a membership organization comprised of 98 coalitions nationwide.  No other organization represents business coalitions for health nationally.

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 06-12-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:  It is recommended white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 by 10 Mar 06; FY 07 by 1 May 06; FY 08 by 1 May 07 and, FY 09 by 1 May 08. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 31 December 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details. 

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

AFRL/IF is soliciting white papers to identify and develop technologies to enable a distributed information infrastructure that provides all the mechanisms and services required to allow the warfighters to craft their C4I information environments, including ability to establish distributed virtual staffs, to share a common consistent perception of the battlespace, and construct distributed task teams among sensors, shooters, movers, and command posts. These technologies will be applied across the full spectrum of cyber operations, in support of Air Force mission requirements. Specific technologies include, but are not limited to: network protocols, information adaptation, network management, routing technologies, adaptive interfaces, distributed information environments, multimedia services, adaptive security services, global resource management, architectures, computer and network risk assessment/management, vulnerability assessment, assurance techniques, detection of intrusions and misuse, network security, wireless information assurance, assessment of information damage, cyber forensics, recovery of information systems and computer networks to operational levels, and a full spectrum of active response and computer network attack techniques.

Information superiority is an integral part of air and space superiority, an Air Force doctrine. This gives the commander freedom from attack, the freedom to maneuver and the freedom to attack. Information superiority is that degree of information advantage of one force over another that permits the conduct of operations at a given time and place without prohibitive opposition. Information operations are not focused exclusively on information superiority and information operations alone is not sufficient to achieve information superiority. AFRL/IF has developed a responsive R&D technology program to help the US achieve information superiority. The technology research in this BAA will be focused in the following areas of information operations: influence operations, network warfare operations and electronic warfare operations.

Influence Operations: Focused on affecting the perceptions and behaviors of leaders, groups, or entire populations. Influence operations employ capabilities to affect behaviors, protect operations, communicate commander's intent and project accurate information to achieve desired effects across the cognitive domain. These effects should result in differing objectives. The military capabilities of influence operations are psychological operations, military deception, operations security, counterintelligence operations, counterpropoganda operations and public affairs operations. 

Network Warfare Operations: The integrated planning, employment, and assessment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog and digital network portion of the battle space. Network warfare operations are conducted in the information domain through the combination of hardware, software, data and human interaction.  The operational activities of network warfare operations are network attack, network defense and network warfare support.

Electronic Warfare Operations: The integrated planning, employment, and assessment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the electromagnetic domain in support operational objectives. 

The objective of this BAA is to address highly innovative R&D areas in information operations. Proposed work should address the innovative and strategic thought of the 21st century adversary, and develop new concepts to counter with innovative information-based capabilities. Further, proposed work should address new concepts for continuously analyzing the information battle space to identify US vulnerabilities and adversary weaknesses, and develop new defensive and offensive strategies and capabilities accordingly.

There are critical technical areas of focus under this BAA which are high leverage areas to be worked in order to address the most difficult Air Force requirements, provide the Air Force with the greatest technology push possible, and surface opportunities for contributing to important national security issues such as defending information systems and countering cyber terrorism.

Network Attack: Employment of network-based capabilities to destroy, disrupt, degrade, deny, delay, corrupt or usurp information resident in or transiting through networks. A primary effect is to influence the adversary commander's decisions.

Network Defense: Employment of network-based capabilities to defend friendly information resident in or transiting through networks against adversary efforts to destroy, disrupt, degrade, deny, delay, corrupt or usurp it. Actions include analyzing network activity to determine the appropriate course of action to protect, detect, and react to internal and external threats to Air Force networks.

Network Warfare Support: The collection and production of network related data for immediate decisions involving network warfare operations. Specifically, network warfare support provides profiling, event analysis, open source review, as well as pattern analysis in support of network defense and countermeasure development.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $40M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $10M; FY 07 - $10M; FY 08 - $10M; and FY09 - $10M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts ranging between $100,000 and $1,000,000 per year.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government. Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and of greater importance than criteria 4. (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation,
(2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge,
(3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).

Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data. However, proposals may only be submitted at the unclassified or SECRET level. Proposals submitted above this level will not be accepted or considered.

3.  REPORTING:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the technical points of contact, as specified below:

Frances Rose, (315) 330-2038; Email: Frances.Rose@rl.af.mil; Brian Spink, (315) 330-7596, Email: Brian.Spink@rl.af.mil.

In accordance with AFFARS 5315.90, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the University of Ghana Medical School, PO Box 4236, Accra, Ghana for the continuation of a study on the estimation of burden of prostate diseases in Accra, Ghana. The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics is carrying out a population-based screening of males in Accra, Ghana, for prostate cancer to investigate the burden of prostate disease in Africans. The study plans to screen 1,000 healthy men aged 50-74 randomly selected from the Accra population for prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), using the serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA) test, digital rectal examination, and biopsy confirmation as needed; compare prostate cancer risk of men in Accra with that of African-Americans in SEER, both before and after 1986, when prostate cancer screening entered widespread use in the U.S.  The goal of this study is to provide support for medical treatment of patients with confirmed prostate cancer or severe symptoms of BPH. The Ghana study is mandated by the NCI and Ghana IRB to treat subjects who are screened and confirmed to have prostate cancer and those who had severe benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). The University of Ghana Medical School is the only known source to the NCI researcher that has the expertise and network in the local community of Accra, Ghana to perform this work.  Ghana was selected as the site for the screening cohort because it is an English speaking country in West Africa with adequate infrastructure to ensure the high-quality of the study.  This includes the availability of a census listing for the random selection of subjects from the population and adequate medical facility for screening and for processing of study samples. This contract is to provide support for continuation of an ongoing study. Changes in the population would be detrimental to the quality of the study. There is no other contractor that has the access to this population and the expertise to carry out the study in Accra, Ghana.  Period of Performance: One year from date of award.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on February 23, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Karen Gardner at gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) Acquisition Center-Washington, on behalf of the RDECOM CERDEC Power Generation Branch, plans to negotiate a sole-source contract with Spectrum Research Corporation for the enhancement of the power electronics module.  The Spectrum Research Corporation-Hybrid Electric Inverter-3kW (SRC-HEI-3kW) was developed by Spectrum Research Corporation under the Project Manager-Mobile Electric Power (PM-MEP), Small Tactical Electric Power (STEP) program.  The SRC-HEI-3kW is energy storage for transient loads and it uses high-frequency and high-voltage input to deliver a continuous output of up to 3kW.  The SRC-HEI-3kW is an inverter that is integrated into a generator and allows syste ms to operate at variable speeds.  The hybrid electric inverter has a range of military tactical uses including field-tent configurations and communications. The SRC-HEI-3kW is considered a proof-of-concept system and requires further investigation to include thermal, dynamic and electrical analysis at both a subcomponent and system level.  The contractor will be tasked to advance and augment the overall perfor mance of the SRC-HEI-3kW, an existing proof-of-concept system.  The contractor will also be tasked to conduct further prototype development of the SRC-HEI-3kW power electronics system.  The effort will result in a comprehensive power electronics prototype design capable of meeting the stringent military requirements for environmental and dynamic loads.  In addition, the effort will investigate alternative packaging and possible modularity of the design to optimize size, weight and flexibility of the power e lectronics system for incorporation into an advanced 3kW generator set design.  Upon completion of the study, a prototype of the advanced SRC-HEI-3kW design will be fabricated. It has been determined that Spectrum Research Corporation is the Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1); Only  One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the required SRC-HEI-3kW improvements may submit a q uote that shall be considered by the agency.  Responses should be no longer than ten (10) pages.  The resultant contract will be cost-plus-fixed-fee.  Responses are to be received via E-mail within 45 calendar days of the date of this notice.  All requests  for further information must be in writing and via E-mail.  Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  You may forward responses to the following E-mail address:  andrew.chappell@cacw.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  See Numbered Note 22.

<ARCHDATE>05302006
<CONTACT>Bethany McClave, 757-878-2003
<DESC>Section I. The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct Basic Research as described below and in the Supplemental Package available on or about 17 February 2006 at http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/Business/Di visions/Contracting/Docs/VLRCOE_Supplemental_Package.doc.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this announcement, as supplemented. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and the aforementioned Supplemental Pa ckage constitute the total solicitation. There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding this requirement.  INTRODUCTION:   The purpose of this BAA is to solicit proposals for a cooperative agreement from U.S. institutions of higher education (HEI) to conduct basic research focused on barrier issues relevant to progress in vertical lift technology in a concentrated interdiscipl inary center for enduring and future force needs.  Since future force combat vehicles will be deployed to remote regions of the world as well as intra-theater utilizing heavy vertical lift vehicles, proposals should focus on research to enable major cost r eductions in heavy vertical lift vehicles and other advanced vertical lift configurations.  This Vertical Lift Research Center of Excellence (VLRCOE) Program is funded by the U.S. Army and managed by the National Rotorcraft Technology Center (NRTC) to supp ort the long-term basic research objectives established by the NRTC and to establish a significant dual-use technology base from which the military aviation community and the rotorcraft industry can draw substantial knowledge and capability.  The VLRCOE co nstitutes the next stage of the U.S. Armys continuing support of a Rotorcraft Centers of Excellence Program initiated in 1982.  This announcement covers the VLRCOE program for five (5) program years, initiating in the Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2006 thr ough 2010.  The Government plans to award up to two VLRCOE agreements consistent with this announcement and subject to the details in the Supplemental Package.   TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:   To be selected, proposing HEI must offer a range of faculty capabilities and appropriate vertical lift-related course work in a number of disciplines to establish a 'center.'  A center may be composed of a lead university and up to 2 partner universities c ollaborating to provide the scope of program necessary to address the widest range of technical fields.  In addition, the inclusion of tasks performed by individual investigators from other universities in order to enhance the program content is encouraged . VLRCOE research topics submitted should include five or more of the following fields:  (1) Aeromechanics, (2) Material Strength and Fatigue Life, (3) Adverse Weather/All Conditions, (4) Rotor/Flight Control Concepts and Design, (5) Vibration and Noise Cont rol, (6) Prognostics and Diagnostics, (7) Propulsion, and (8) Affordability.  Research topics should be focused on basic scientific issues that are of unique importance to vertical lift and that have the potential for making significant contributions towar ds U.S. Army research thrusts and DOD goals and missions.  Interdisciplinary research efforts should be emphasized, but should be focused on fundamental physical phenomena and understandings.  Technology transfer and the partnering of this research endeavo r with the U.S. rotorcraft industry, U.S. Army, other Government organizations (e.g., FAA, NASA) and other academic institutions are encouraged.  The use of graduate fellowships at enhanced stipend levels is also encouraged as a means of attracting the hig hest caliber U.S. students to the program. DELIVERABLES:  A VLRCOE shall present an annual program review supported by presentation materials that will document the progress and research accomplished during each program year. At the end of the 5-year program , a final program report is required for the total 5-year program.  The final report shall include the VLRCOEs overall accomplishments, research paper publications, degree recipients, patents filed, and technical accomplishments of each task.  The VLRCOE shall submit Federal Cash Transaction Reports (SF 272) on a quarterly basis and a final within 90 days after the Agreement expiration date.   Section II. Award Information:   ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  The anticipated Government funding for the program is approximately $1,800,000 per year for all awards.  It is intended that a center will be a competitive environment in which the annual program review wi ll provide opportunities for evaluating progress on technical tasks and making changes to the program as needed.  Although a five-year program with specific tasks will be negotiated for each center prior to award, the Government reserves the right, pursuan t to the terms of the Agreement governing modifications and additional research, to add new tasks or make changes to existing tasks as additional Government funding becomes available and/or funding is redirected from tasks that are not productive. TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  The Government anticipates an award of a Technology Investment Agreement that is a Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358, as the Government desires to be substantially involved in the performance of the VLRCOE Program. Offe rors submitting proposals under this announcement are required to cost share.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 32 10.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) accessible at the following link:  http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/32106r_041398/part34.pdf.  This announcement will remain open until 4:00 p.m. Eastern time March 31, 2006. Awards under this ann ouncement are anticipated to be made by June 1, 2006.  However, unless the offeror specifies a different expiration time, proposals will be considered valid for Government acceptance through September 30, 2006. The Government reserves the right to select f or award any, all, or none of the proposals received. Further, the Government reserves the right to select for award only a portion of an offeror's proposal.  Any award, partial or full, is conditioned upon being evaluated as meritorious as a VLRCOE as des cribed in Section V below.  Section III.  Eligibility Information:   Participation is limited to U.S. institutions of higher education.  Further, all work or research performed under the cooperative agreement(s) resulting from this announcement must be performed within the United States.  Proposals including work or researc h that will be performed outside of the United States, in whole or in part, are not acceptable and will not be given further consideration for award.   Section IV.

Offerors desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing.  Oral explanations or instructions given before the award of any agreement will not be binding. Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning this announcement which is necessary in submitting offers or the lack of which would be prejudicial to any other prospective offeror(s) will be published as an amendment to this announcement.  Proposals will not be accepted v ia FAX or electronic mail.  Only materials within page limitations will be evaluated.  Proposals must be received by the time and date stated above.  For purposes of this announcement, late proposals will be treated in accordance with FAR 52.215-1.  A copy  of any cited reference/clause is available via link http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.  Late proposals will not be reviewed or returned.   Section V.  Application Review Information.   EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD:  The selection of one or more sources (i.e., centers or VLRCOEs) for award will be based on an evaluation of proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth below and in the Supplemental Package.  The proposals will first be evaluated as an integrated, balanced center and then the 5-year program technical tasks will be subjected to a scientific peer review by a team of knowledgeable scientists/engineers.  The tasks will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under thi s announcement. These evaluations will result in narrative ratings, which will be used to develop an order of merit listing for proposals and technical programs submitted under this announcement. Proposed cost will be evaluated as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness, concurrently with the scientific peer review.  Note that it is possible for a proposal to be excluded from the competition if it is deemed to lack the established merits to be a VLRCOE based upon the following criteria (some of which ar e mandatory or go-no-go criteria, at program, not task, level).  These criteria are equally weighted as part of the overall assessment of the viability of the offeror to become a VLRCOE:   (1) Participation of Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) (mandatory); (2) Cost sharing and university support (mandatory);  (3) Critical mass of technical expertise within the center;  (4) Subcontracts with partner universities to achieve adequate program balance; (5) Participation by individual investigators from other universities to strengthen the merit of the offerors program; (6) Vertical lift technology courses offered to graduate students within the center; (7) Adequacy of the plans for implementing and administering a Vertical Lift Fellowship program for attracting outstanding U.S. graduate students into the VLRCOE program;  (8) Balance of technical tasks; (9) Experimental facilities and equipment; and  (10) Strategies for technology transfer to industry and Government.    The evaluation criteria applicable to the technical tasks in the proposals will be applied to determine which of the proposed tasks will be funded in any VLRCOE agreement(s).  The technical tasks will be evaluated using the following criteria:  (1) Scientific merits and technical approaches of the proposed research task;  (2) Uniqueness/relevance of the proposed task to the competitive position of the U.S. rotorcraft industry and advancement of U.S. military vertical lift technologies;  (3) Qualifications and past contributions of the principal investigators and other key research personnel in the proposed research area;  (4) Technology transfer plan including partnering with the industry, military and federal aviation communities, and  (5) Reasonableness and consistency of proposed budget for accomplishing the proposed research.   The first three equally weighted technical task criteria are of greater importance than  the last two, which are of equal importance.  Any proposed cost share will be evaluated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achieving program objectives, and furthering the state-of-the-art.  Proposed cost to the Government is a review criterion.  T he amount of cost sharing percentage could result in greater evaluation credit.   SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: All work performed under resulting agreement(s) will be unclassified and will not require access to classified material.  The preponderance of research performed is anticipated to be basic or fundamental research exempt from export c ontrols.  However, it is possible that one or more project tasks may require access to and/or generate technical data the export of which may be restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U. S. C., Sec. 2751 et. Seq.) or Executive Order 12470.  P rior to award, the successful offeror may be required to provide an 'Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement' certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25 if any proposed task is determined to be subject to export controls. This certif ication may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FBA Federal Ctr., Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572. Participation in this program is limited, regardless of tier, to U. S. entities.

If Government Furnished Property is necessary, it shall be detailed in the proposal.    Section VI.  Award Administration Information:  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any response preparation cost.  The previously referred to Supplemental Package provides detailed instructions cri tical to proper preparation and submission of a proposal. Section VII. Agency Contacts.

Wildlife's PAT tags have been used previously by NOAA's Ecosystems and Oceanography Division (EOD), Honolulu, HI to obtain accurate and highly consistent data on the behavior of large pelagic fish and have been found to be incomparable to any other similar satellite-linled instruments. Therefore it is in the government's opinion that no other manufacturer has a comparsble unit that provides both location at sea and dive behavior (i.e, tempersture and depth, such as Wildlife Computers' PAT tags.  Responsible parties may submit a bid or proposal. The period of performance states that 12 tags must be received by May 30, 2006.

<SOLNBR>4577
<RESPDATE>033106
<CONTACT>Dy  Le, (609) 485-4636
<DESC>***NOTE*** This Announcement has been modified to increase the fiscal year Not To Exceed value from $250,000 to $300,000.   All other terms and conditions remain unchanged from thr original posting ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-06-0007 - Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) 1. Background Currently, no rotorcraft HUMS, along with the ground-based station, has been certified by the FAA to provide usage or condition-based monitoring (e.g., health monitoring) for maintenance credits.  Certification of a HUMS for maintenance credit purposes is considered to be a complex endeavor.  "Maintenance Credit" means to give approval to a HUMS application that adds to, replaces, or intervenes in industry accepted maintenance practices or flight operations.   AC 29-2C, Section MG-15, is the only FAA Advisory Circular (AC) providing guidance for HUMS airworthiness approval.  Section MG-15 provides guidance for Transport category rotorcraft to achieve airworthiness approval for installation, credit validation, and instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) for a full range of HUMS application.  The AC establishes an acceptable means, but not the only means of certifying a rotorcraft HUMS regardless of complexity or intended usage to modify maintenance and/or operational actions.   Installation approval covers the certification requirements (e.g. hardware and software qualification requirements) for systems and equipment that acquires, stores, processes, and displays HUMS data.  The approval also includes the airframe installation or any one of these functions for a particular application.  AC 29-2C, Section MG-15, addresses the most complex and extensive HUMS.  Less complex systems may be covered by use of only the applicable parts of the AC.  In addition, there may be different functional distributions between airborne and ground-based equipment.  The requirements of HUMS equipment consists of common criteria; which apply to airborne, ground-based, and installation equipment; plus the unique criteria for airborne and ground based systems. The AC requires that any HUMS applications for which maintenance credits are sought must be validated.  Evidence shall be provided to show that the physics involved for each application is understood.  This will allow the monitoring technique/algorithm/parameter, rejection criteria, and associated intervention actions to be well chosen.  If an approved system is going to be changed, re-evaluation is required to ensure the existing credit(s) are not invalidated.  Re-evaluation efforts will vary and depend on the application type, the credit sought, and the degree of failure or malfunction associated with the component/equipment.    HUMS applicants are also required to provide the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Requirements (FAR) and Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), Part 29.  An applicant may be the airframe manufacturer, the HUMS OEM, or the aircraft operator.  ICA should address the integration of HUMS with the aircraft.  The applicant must address the ICA items listed in the AC for airborne and ground-based systems and equipment in addition to FAR/JAR Part 29. Section MG-15 of AC 29-2C was developed by the Rotorcraft Health Usage Monitoring System Advisory Group and first released in 1999.  This advisory group consisted of representatives from the FAA Aircraft Certification Services, FAA Aircraft Evaluation Group, U.S. Industry, European Industry, and Joint Airworthiness Authority.  This AC was written in a generic manner such that it provides the basic requirements and guidance for certification of HUMS.  Since no HUMS have yet to be certified in accordance with this AC on a "maintenance credit" basis, the FAA intends to conduct research to assist in the validation of the certification guidance.  Additionally, HUMS research efforts are to develop, validate, and/or demonstrate HUMS operational requirements, applicable technologies including processes; methodologies; and algorithms, and other required information including data to guide the certification of HUMS.  The results of HUMS R&D will also allow the FAA to expand the existing guidance by incorporating any lessons learned at the conclusion of the research.  2. Purpose The objective of this BAA is to solicit proposals to conduct research to support the validation and demonstration of HUMS operation requirements, technologies, and processes and to collect and substantiate structural usage data for maintenance credits.  Particularly, this effort shall support AC-29-2C, Section MG-15, which can be downloaded using the following link:  http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/MainFrame?OpenFrameSet 3. Submission Deadlines Technical summary proposals shall be prepared according to guidelines described in sections 4 (Submission Requirements) and 5 (Two-Page Technical Summary Requirements).  Technical summary proposals will be accepted until fiscal year 2006 (FY-06) funding for this effort is fully committed.  Offerors are therefore encouraged to submit the technical summary proposal as soon as they can before FY-06 funding is fully committed or exhausted.  Upon request from the FAA, formal technical proposals addressing the research requirements described in section 6 shall be submitted not more than thirty (30) working days after the date of the request sent by email.  FAA's request will be made via email followed up with an official letter.  4. Submission Requirements Offerors will submit two-page technical summaries prior to submitting a formal proposal.  The two-page technical summary shall meet the requirements described below.  Mail the two-page technical summaries to: FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center Code AAR-480, Building 300 (Attn: D. Le) Atlantic City Int'l Airport, NJ 08405 In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the summary proposal will be emailed to dy.le@faa.gov.  The electronic version shall be provided in Microsoft Word.  Submitted electronic proposals shall not have any security protection requiring the FAA to obtain a password or an authorization from the offeror prior to opening the proposal or file.  The FAA will not review submitted proposals having security protection. Thirty (30) working days or earlier, after receipt of the two-page technical summaries, the FAA will respond to offerors in one of three ways: a.	Request for the submission of a formal technical proposal. b.	Recommendation to submit a formal technical proposal if certain changes are made or conditions met. c.	Rejection of the summary proposal. If requested, the offeror shall submit a formal technical proposal, containing a detailed discussion of the items presented in the selected two-page technical summary.  Additionally, the formal technical proposal shall address all or some of the research requirements described in section 6 of this announcement, Formal Proposal Requirements.  The formal technical proposal will be mailed to the FAA at the same address as the summary proposal.  In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the formal technical proposal in Microsoft Word will be emailed to dy.le@faa.gov.  Submitted electronic proposals shall not have any security protection requiring the FAA to obtain a password or an authorization from the offeror prior to opening the proposal or file.  The FAA will not review submitted proposals having security protection. The FAA shall receive both versions of the formal technical proposals according to the submission deadlines required in section 3. Formal proposals shall not exceed 50 pages. 5. Two-Page Technical Summary Requirements There is no specific format for the two-page technical summary.  The summary may be preceded by a cover letter, but the cover letter will not be considered in the evaluation, nor will pages in excess of two.  At a minimum the summary shall contain the following items: a.	Affiliation, contact or principal investigator name, phone, and mailing   and email addresses. b.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS IS ONLY MODIFIED TO REFLECT THE CURRENT CLOSING DATE FOR THE SOLICITATION POSTED ON THIS WEBSITE.  This synopsis is issued to notify Faith Based Institutions in the District of Columbia that Court  Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) for the District of Columbia requires Faith Based Coordination Services for Offender Reintegration on a firm-fixed price, contractual basis.  The planned contract will consist of a one year base and 4 one year options.  CSOSA may award multiple contracts under the solicitation to be issued for this requirement, which will ONLY be electronically issued on the FedBizzOpps website (www.fbo.gov), along any amendments thereto.  A Faith Based Institution shall be a house of worship such as a mosque, temple, or church, or an entity whose membership is composed primarily of clergy and which is affiliated with one or more houses of worship.  Such house of worship shall currently exist within the District of Columbia geographical boundaries.  CSOSA is an independent executive branch federal agency established pursuant to the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997.  CSOSA assumed cognizance related to pretrial services, parole, probation and other supervised release functions in and on behalf of the District of Columbia.  Its mission is to improve public safety, prevent crime, reduce recidivism, and support the fair administration of justice in close collaboration with the community, local and federal authorities.  In January 2002, CSOSA announced the inception of a broad-based support system that involves community supervision and the faith community in a concerted effort to: reduce recidivism rates among offenders under CSOSA supervision; improve public safety in the District by facilitating successful re-entry of offenders into the community; develop partnership or mentorship programs with stakeholders in an effort to meet mutual goals; and build capacity of Faith Based Institutions to increase the likelihood of future successful collaborative relationships.  Therefore, CSOSA intends to contract for cluster coordinative leadership in specific geographic areas within the District of Columbia.  A cluster is a group of Faith-Based Institutions, located in a designated geographical area, that has formed a partnership and has agreed to participate jointly in providing Faith-Based Reintegration Services.  Cluster coordinative leadership shall include, but is not limited to, assisting the Government and other participating Faith Based Institutions in identifying, expanding and applying the various ministries and outreach program strategies, building capacity for program management and analysis, furthering the development of a case management system to track offenders referred to the program, and implementing a volunteer management program to accurately track availability of mentors and other volunteers that are responsive to the needs of the reentering offenders and their families.  The lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) shall provide all necessary personnel, supervision, equipment, materials and supplies to facilitate and coordinate Faith Based Reintegration Service delivery for offenders.  The Lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) shall also perform varied data collection and reporting duties on behalf of all participating Faith Based Institutions in a cluster.  It shall be expressly agreed and understood that the planned contract(s) is a nonpersonal services contract(s), as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.101, under which the professional services rendered by the Lead Faith Based Institution (contractor) are rendered in its capacity as an independent contractor.  The successful Faith Based Institution (contractor) will be selected using a best value approach, with technical criteria being equal in importance to price / cost.  The proposed contract(s) is 100% set aside for small business concerns.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 813110 with a small business size standard of $6.5 MIL.  Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract.  Such registration may be accomplished at www.ccr.gov.  A paper copy of this solicitation will not be available to requestors and, therefore, the Government will not be maintaining a mailing list.  It is incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the solicitation via this website (once it is issued) in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt may render a proposal ineligible for award.  The solicitation issue date will around 23 January 2006.  Proposal submittal requirements will be identified in SECTION L of the solicitation and timely proposals (offers) will be evaluated in accordance with SECTION M.  This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, it does not restrict the Governments ultimate selection approach, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation cost.

Suit will be used primarily for, but not limited to, physical training  activity (PT).  All Garments submitted should incorporate commercially  available innovative garment design and fabric performance to provide  comfort, functionality and durability.  Advanced performance technologies  such as garment/fabric “systems” a plus, and incorporation of Fiber/finish  Nanotechnology is also highly desirable. Important features to be considered are: Physical properties such as exemplary tensile and tear strength, the  ability to wick & transmit vapor, repel water, resist staining, abrasion &  air permeation.  Strong color performance properties to minimize Crocking,  CF to light, color change after laundering and Perspiration staining are  desired.  Priorities include reduction in overall weight, noise, and  durability to repeated home launderings.  The use of anti-microbial agents  is also beneficial.   Lining should address factors such as moisture  management/breath ability, abrasion resistance, stretch ability, and  optimal comfort as it will be worn closest to the skin.  Current suit is  used across varied climates.  In addition trunks may be used for swimming  in some cases, so resistance to salt & chlorine are also factors for  consideration. Finished garments should be the same or similar in appearance/design to  current specs (referenced above).   Any available industry advancements in  reflective technology are desired to optimize visibility/safety, and  should be incorporated. Interested parties must submit finished garment prototypes along with  complete technical data information including but not limited to the tests  listed below. • Weight oz/sq.yd. ASTM D3776 • Yarns per inch ASTM D3775 • Breaking Strength ASTM D5034 • Tear Strength ASTM D1424 • Dimensional Stability AATCC135 After 20 launderings • Water Resistance AATCC 22 • Moisture Vapor Trans, ASTM E96 Test BW (Inverted) & Test B (Upright) • Air Permeability D737 • Stretch & Recovery (if containing Stretch fiber) ASTM D3107 (Colorfastness should be based on USAF Blue or similar dark color) • Crocking ASTM D 5053 • CF to light AATCC 16 (Opt 3) • CF to laundering AATCC 61 • CF perspiration AATCC 15 -Garment testing should also address: Component Attachment Strength & appearance after laundering Appearance after laundering AATCC 135 Torquing/Skewing AATCC 179 (Method 2 option 3) All garment received will become Government property and the Government  will not return any samples submitted.

<ARCHDATE>03092006

<DESC>Award was made to Hydro-Aire, Inc, 3000 Winona Ave, Burbank, CA 91504-2540 in the amount of $ 124,920 for 30 each Wheel Speed Transducer with Part # 140-285 & 30 each Hubcap Part # 140-28530.
Award was made on the 17th of January 2006.


Description:	The function of the entire assembly is to sense wheel speed at landing to prevent skid on a runway by communicating with an on-board control unit that monitors brake application pressure.  Other salient characteristics are described below:

Two wheel-speed transducers provide individual wheel velocity measurement for each of the braked wheels. The transducers have axle adapters to allow them to be mounted inside the axles.  The transducer-adapter assembly is secured by threaded fasteners protruding through the axle and castellated wheel axle nuts.  The transducer shaft extends from the transducer toward the hubcap.  On the shaft, a drive coupling is installed, which is driven by the hubcap drive mechanism.  The field-proven hubcap-transducer drive interface is of sufficient rotational stiffness and strength to prevent transmission of erroneous wheel-speed velocity signals.  The coupling design can accommodate angular and parallel misalignment and axial assembly tolerance without degradation such as premature bearing or drive coupling wear.  The transducer is a variable reluctance alternator with 36 poles (teeth) on the rotor with 36 matching poles (teeth) on the stator.  The magnetic field is provided by a coaxial coil energized by the control unit transducer bias current.  With the excitation applied, a static magnetic field is established between the north and south poles of the rotor, air gap, stator and return path iron of the transducer, and no output is produced.  As the wheel rotates, rotor teeth pass the stator slots and teeth, causing variations in the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, which causes a change in the flux linking the coil.  The transducer output is, therefore, a sinusoidally varying voltage, with a frequency directly proportional to wheel rotational velocity.

Transducer Weight:  The weight of the wheel-speed transducer is 1.1 pounds.  The weight will be further defined after final axle adapter design.  The transducer weight does not include the weight of the hubcap, which is included in the total system weight estimate.  The proposed wheel-speed transducer is similar to Hydro-Aire 36-tooth wheel-speed transducers used on numerous commercial, business and military aircraft.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Missouri is anticipating establishment of blanket purchase agreements for the technical review of appraisals.  These appraisals have been or will be completed on land located throughout the state of Missouri that may be placed under a conservation easement through the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP), Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) or the Farm and Ranchland Protection Program (FRPP).  The purpose of the technical review of appraisals is to provide an opinion of the acceptability of the appraisals that provide a market value of the whole subject property before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the whole subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value minus any adjustments for excess irrigation water to arrive at the effect on value of the easement.  The technical review must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS.  The original appraisal being reviewed will have been completed in compliance with the same standards. 

If you are interested in providing a quote for services, please contact the Contracting Officer at renee.gardner@mo.usda.gov for a copy of the BPA.

The anticipated contract start date is 1 October 2006, with a period of performance of a base year and four (4) options years.  If you feel you can provide these services, please provide a 3-10 page Capabilities Statement, addressing the items below, to Captain David Huber at david.huber@nellis.af.mil and 1Lt Micah O’Neal at micah.oneal@nellis.af.mil, NLT 1600 PST on 28 February 2006:

·	What capabilities does your organization possess to successfully accomplish the JUAS CoE requirements described in this RFI?
·	What is your business size (e.g., 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, large business, etc.)?
·	If a solicitation for this effort were issued, would your organization submit a proposal as a prime contractor or a subcontractor?
·	What percentage of this effort would be appropriate for a small business set-aside?
·	The Government preliminarily envisions a firm fixed price contract for this effort, with the unit of issue as a “month”.  The Government preliminarily envisions having multiple CLINs for individual labor categories.  Is a FFP type contract with the unit of issue a “month” most appropriate for this effort?  If not, what type do you think may work better and why?
·	Based on the required services listed above, please provide a rough order of magnitude on how much you estimate this effort to cost over a five-year period (if possible, please breakdown cost by labor category and by year).
·	Do you hold any contracts similar in work/scope to the services identified above?  Can you provide those contract numbers and their values?  Can you provide a point of contact name/number?
·	Do you have a GSA schedule contract for the services identified above?  
·	As unanticipated or short-notice taskings are levied on the JUAS CoE, the Government might require additional support from time to time for the services described above (i.e., “surge” requirements).  Though these surge requirements are envisioned to be quite infrequent, do you have the capability to provide additional “surge” support on a periodic basis?  If so, how much lead time do you estimate needing to provide "surge" support (e.g., if the Government identified additional support requirements for a particular labor category, how many days would you envision it taking to provide additional support)?  Additionally, can you provide “surge” capabilities for some labor categories that are not mentioned, but are very similar in nature (particularly the technical/engineering categories)?
·	Do you currently have personnel and facilities cleared at the TS/SCI-level?  
·	Would you need a “phase-in” period on the contract in order to fill positions for this contract, or are you capable of having all personnel in place when period of performance begins in October 2006 (estimated)?
·	If you have any questions regarding this effort please include them in your Capabilities Statement (this will not count against your page limit).

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking potential sources for the continued development, integration and operation of the External Sensors Laboratory (ESL) in support of the MDA Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).     This effort requires the expansion of a SCI-level data processing lab at the Joint National Integration Center, Shriever AFB, CO.  This laboratory will interface with pre-processed data from overhead national infrared (ONIR) to include the Defense Satellite Program (DSP) and the Space-Based Infrared (SBIR) Program, and make those data sources available in the SCI portion of the ESL for processing on an open architecture system.  This effort includes: 1) the development, maintenance, accreditation, system engineering, operations and configuration control of the External Sensors Laboratory hardware; 2) establishing and maintaining the interfaces between the ONIR sources and the ESL; 3) continued development of the developmental SBIR track fusion algorithm; 4) maintenance and support of the current processing software; 5) development and maintenance a configuration management plan which allows hosting, demonstration and testing of other developers algorithms within the ESL; and 6) establishment and maintenance of  real-time connectivity with  MDAs Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) system.

Credible potential sources would require the capability to perform the following:
1.  Systems engineering, configuration control, test planning, and integration functions necessary to develop and operate the ESL.
2.  Acquire, install, test and maintain required processing hardware and software in the ESL at the JNIC.
3.  Demonstrate and maintain interface between ESL and MDAs C2BMC system.  
4.  Establish and maintain interface between ONIR sources (to include pre-processed DSP and SBIR data) and the ESL.
5. Advise government on technical performance aspects of ONIR sensors and how to interface with them.
6. Establish and maintain interface between ESL and other data sources operating at the Secret, SCI and Special Access Program levels.

The estimated cost for the continued development, integration and operations of the ESL is $5M per year and it is estimated to be a five-year project. The incumbent contractor is Northrop Grumman.

Interested parties are invited to submit a capability statement, not to exceed three (3) pages to the points-of-contact named below by no later than 15 days from the date this synopsis is published.  The capability statement must summarize the respondents strengths in relationship to the following criteria:
1.   Describe the qualification and capability to perform the type of work specified above.
2.   Describe present or recent experience with DoD and / or NASA for the type of work specified above.

<DESC>White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) has been tasked with developing a common tracking mount specification to be utilized in acquiring the next generation of optical tracking systems.  The old Kineto Tracking Mounts designed and procured during the mid t o late 1980s have surpassed expectation for life-cycle mission support at member Ranges of the Range Commanders Council (RCC). While many systems still function, they are composed of numerous obsolete components and sub-systems. The future demands a speci fication for a new tracking system to serve the future requirements of the Ranges be developed and replacement of the old systems executed. Requirements have changed over time and will change into the future. The new tracking systems should have commonalit y across the ranges to reduce cost, provide the platform for the digital future while maintaining the accuracy to be the platform of choice for precision optical data collection and the versatile capabilities of the previous platforms. WSMR is seeking comm ents through this sources sought announcement that address the proposed specifications and industry capabilities.  Required and desired specifications for the Large Tracking System (LTS) and Small Tracking System (STS) are available at http://www.wsmr.army .mil/docpage/pages/sol_stat.htm   This is a request for submission of comments only and not a request for proposals.  The information obtained through this announcement will be condensed and presented to the Optical Systems Group in late March by a WSMR re presentative and utilized in formulating a realistic set of specifications to be used in a competitive purchase of the next generation of tracking systems.  Comments must be submitted electronically to Nan Tindal at nan.tindal@us.army.mil and must be recei ved NLT 4:00 PM MST on 06 March 2006.

<NAICS>541990
<OFFADD>DHS - Border and Transportation Security, Transportation Security Administration, Headquarters TSA, 601 S. 12th Street TSA-25, 10th Floor, Arlington, VA, 22202
<SUBJECT>B -- TSA Registered Traveler Program Request for Information
<DESC>1. General Information
Document:  Request for Information (RFI)

2. Contracting Office Address
Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration (TSA), 701 South 12th Street, Arlington, VA 22202 

3. Background
The mission of the Registered Traveler (RT) Program is to expedite screening procedures for qualified individuals at selected U.S. airports.  The RT Program will be a voluntary program in which individuals who provide biometric and biographic data, undergo a TSA security threat assessment, pay a user fee, and are deemed eligible by TSA, will be allowed to use designated or dedicated security lines at participating airports and may receive additional screening benefits correlated to the security threat assessment performed.

The goal of the RT program is to increase the efficiency of the Transportation Security Officers and security resources.  Airline passengers who have successfully completed a security threat assessment by TSA may be expedited through security checkpoint processing and allow security resources to focus on unknown travelers.  TSA anticipates the enhancement of overall aviation security and the likelihood of maintaining or improving non-RT security checkpoint wait times. 

4. Purpose
The TSA Registered Traveler Program (RT) is seeking information to assist in the development of a Business Model to govern the nationwide implementation of the RT program. Specifically, TSA seeks alternative methodologies for implementing each component of the Business Model as well as the technologies or services available to support implementation.

TSA desires innovative and creative ideas for the RT Business Model.  After reviewing the responses, TSA may incorporate into the final model any or all of the information provided.  

5. Critical Functions
Listed below are the critical functions inherent to the RT Program and are mandatory elements for a comprehensive business plan. Other than noting the mandatory nature of these critical functions, TSA does not define how these critical functions are met, and what, if any enhancements or desirables are to be included in the Business Model.   

•	Enrollment and biometric capture
•	Identity/document validation at enrollment
•	Card issuance and revocation
•	Data transfer and storage throughout the system
•	Interface technology for the smart card and verification system
•	Audit processes and procedures
•	Compensation for participating entities
•	Identification verification at the security checkpoint
•	Membership renewal

6.  Program Guidelines
Minimally, the completed Business Model for the national RT program implementation will:
•	Utilize a public-private partnership with clear delineation of roles and responsibilities, including revenue allocation;  
•	Require interoperability of all participating RT program sites from the onset of operations (interoperability is defined as a valid card issued to any eligible participant and is operational at all authorized RT program sites without regard to where the card was issued);
•	Accommodate all eligible enrollees through the use of technology that incorporates multiple biometrics;   
•	Collect a complete set of fingerprint images and two (2) iris images at participant enrollment;  
•	Utilize a smart card with the iris and fingerprint biometrics stored on the RT card for the use of identity verification only 
•	 Include an identity authentication and verification element to link the security threat assessment to the correct individual through the biometric;
•	Sustain the Program solely through user fees; 
•	Utilize the Transportation Security Clearinghouse (TSC) to aggregate biometric and biographic data and provide associated customer service;
•	Create an open architecture to allow access to all interested airports/air carriers and qualified vendors from the program’s inception;
•	Facilitate rapid roll-out; and
•	Provide scalable and sustainable operations.

TSA will define all security policies and standards; conduct the security threat assessments and adjudications; maintain security screening operations at the checkpoint lane; and oversee performance and compliance.  Transportation Security Clearinghouse (TSC) is a central, neutral data management body that will facilitate the flow of information.  

7.  Submission Instructions
As appropriate, submissions may address one or more subject areas and should describe how to define each process identified, i.e., how to define and estimate the applicant volume that drives your business model assumptions (e.g. what level of capital/infrastructure investment required, operational costs and resultant pricing of your services to applicants and/or partners); define fee structure to include flow of funds; provide incentives for stakeholders; encourage participant enrollment; identify the roles of service providers and possible contractual relationships; define the participant enrollment and member verification process, etc.   

Please note that this request for information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for competitive bids or proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Since this is not an active procurement, please do not include your business qualification statements. Submissions should be limited to a total count of 15 pages per submittal.  Send all responses via e-mail to the TSA Contracting Officer and must be received no later than 12:00 noon ET on 20 January 2006.  Early submittals are encouraged and will be reviewed upon receipt. Telephone responses will not be accepted.  

8.  Public Meeting Notice
A meeting will be held on December 20, 2005 from 10:30 to 12:30 ET at TSA Headquarters, 601 South 12th Street, Arlington, VA.  The meeting is for fact-finding and is provided as a courtesy to all interested parties to discuss the RFI submittal.  All available details have been provided in this RFI and on the TSA Web site.  TSA will make a reasonable effort to respond to all written questions and comments.  Questions and comments submitted after January 06, 2005 may not receive a direct response from TSA; however, all responses will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website.  If the demand presents itself, TSA may conduct a second industry day after January 03, 2006.

The meeting facility is limited to 145 people; therefore, TSA will also provide a conference call bridge for your participation.  RSVP your preference to attend the meeting in person or via conference call, by email, to Freda Powell, no later than 12:00 p.m. ET on December 16, 2005.

<SUBJECT>R -- For-Hire Survey - Survey Year 2006 and Survey Year 2007
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plans to extend existing purchase orders using simplified acquisition procedures with the following state governments:  Maine, Georgia and North Carolina under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253c(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The services will be procured in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13, through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-08.  The purpose of this acquisition is to procure services required by the Magnusun-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act statutory authority, to conduct a vessel-directory survey designed to gather information on fishing effort (number of angler trips) and other trip-specific information by marine recrea¬tional anglers fishing on for-hire (charter and party/head) vessels.  The survey will be conducted by the states of Maine, Georgia and North Carolina which will be required to contact captains in their respective states using a standard questionnaire and the online reporting tool.  The proposed extensions will affect Purchase Order Nos. DG133F-05-CN-1292, DG133F-05-CN-1293 and DG133F-05-CN-1294.  The data collection period begins March 2006; the reporting period  will end March 2008.  No other vendor at this time can provide the services as the Government is required to collect the data from these identified states.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however all proposals received within ten days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with the above-identified orders based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.  Reference NFFK0000-6-0007X.

<SUBJECT>26 -- TIRE PRIVATIZATION INDUSTRY DAY IAW THE 2005 BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE (BRAC) STATUTE
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  In accordance with the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) statute, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will host a Tire Privatization Industry Day on Thursday, March 9, 2006, at the Defense Supply Center, Columbus (DSCC), Columbus, OH.

The purpose of this Industry Day is to discuss establishing a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) approach for the supply chain management of tires for the Department of Defense.  Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for tires (Federal Supply Classes 2610, 2620, and 2630) became law on November 8, 2005.  This recommendation is intended to create a more responsive supply support to user organizations and deployment, and the sustainment of forces when deployed worldwide.  Privatization enables the Department to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translate into improved support to customers at less cost.  This recommendation disestablishes the wholesale supply, storage, and distribution functions for all tires used by the Department of Defense, retaining only the supply contracting function.  The Department will privatize these functions and will rely on private industry for the performance of supply, storage, and distribution of these commodities.  By doing so, the Department can divest itself of inventories and can eliminate infrastructure and personnel associated with these functions.  This Industry Day is for informational purposes only.  The Government will present several briefings to broadly address BRAC requirements, the Army and Air Force Tire programs, Distribution, Disposal and the acquisition strategy for the privatization of tires.  DLA is interested in receiving industry comments, recommendations, and ideas regarding this initiative.  The agenda will include a time for questions and answers as well as informal discussions.  Written comments will also be accepted.

Final registration is due by Thursday, March 2, 2006, 2:00 PM EST.  To register, please send an email to Kathy Manley (614)692-2258, at DSCC.Tires@dla.mil  with your company name and address, CAGE code, names of attendees, and a primary point of contact to include telephone number and e-mail address.

<SUBJECT>B -- BPA for Technical Review of Appraisals
<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Missouri is anticipating establishment of blanket purchase agreements for the technical review of appraisals.  These appraisals have been or will be completed on land located throughout the state of Missouri that may be placed under a conservation easement through the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP), Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) or the Farm and Ranchland Protection Program (FRPP).  The purpose of the technical review of appraisals is to provide an opinion of the acceptability of the appraisals that provide a market value of the whole subject property before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the whole subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value minus any adjustments for excess irrigation water to arrive at the effect on value of the easement.  The technical review must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS.  The original appraisal being reviewed will have been completed in compliance with the same standards.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

              (3)       A certificate of each policy of insurance must be furnished to the CO within ten (10) days after notice of award certifying, among other things, that the policy contains the aforementioned endorsement.

The certification also provides that the bidder/offeror does not and will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location under its control where segregated facilities are maintained. FAR Clause 52.222-21 must be included in all subcontracts as well.

(e)       Non-Personal Services

              (1)       As stated in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter 92-1, dated September 23, 1992, Inherently Governmental Functions, no personal services shall be performed under this contract. No Contractor employee will be directly supervised by the Government.     All individual employee assignments, and daily work direction, shall be given by the applicable employee supervisor. If the Contractor believes any Government action or communication has been given that would create a personal services relationship between the Government and any Contractor employee, the Contractor must promptly notify the Contracting Officer of this communication or action.
              (2)       The Contractor must not perform any inherently Governmental actions under this contract.

The substance of this clause must be included in all subcontracts at any tier.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is seeking sources for Conference Space and Services for the Columbus, Ohio for May 15-16, 2006 for the USPTO’s Conference on Intellectual Property in the Global Marketplace.  The anticipated attendance is 260 persons including attendees, speakers and support staff.  Hotel rooms for 10 people for 2 nights are required for check-in on May 14, 2006 with check-out on May 16, 2006. The hotel rooms will not be charged to the USPTO’s master account, but will be paid by government travel card.


The USPTO requires the following event space:  


Classroom Style Room:  A space which will accommodate 250 people in a classroom style.  The space is required for May 14, 2006 for A/V setup, and May 15, and May 16, 2006 for actual conference from 8:00 am – 5:00 pm. The room does not need to be reserved the entire day on Sunday for the AV setup but adequate time is required.  The room should be large enough for attendee seating, an A/V worktable in back, platform for videotape camera, and a dais in the front of the room with room for a podium and possibly for a table for four people for panel discussions.  

Press Room – A space which will accommodate at least 12 people for May 15, and May 16, from 8:00am – 2:00pm.  Room must have telephone local calling access.

Break Out Room(s)

Space to hold one-on-one consultations that occur on May 15, from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm and on May 16, from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm.  The space should be able to accommodate 4 round tables with 4 chairs at each table and should be able to be spaced far enough apart so that a group at one table does not disturb a group at another table. If this requirement can be accommodated in the main conference room (with some reconfiguration), that is acceptable.

Refreshments for Breaks - The USPTO requires setup for two breaks in the mornings for refreshments for both days.  Morning breaks would consist of an al la carte menu items such as coffee, juice, soda, danish, bagels, etc.  

Audio/Visual

The USPTO IPAC events require an array of audiovisual equipment and support.  Aside from the equipment, we will need personnel to set up the site, be on-site throughout the two-day event to run the equipment and trouble shoot any problems which might arise during the conference, videotape selected presentations, take down the site after the conference, and have adequate off-site facilities for post-conference production to include editing and conforming videotaped presentations to individual educational modules for future training use.  It is anticipated that the audiovisual equipment may need to be set up on Sunday, May 14.

<DESC>Question and Answers
1.	The contractor shall ensure that the maintenance includes on-site and telephone maintenance (7 am to 5 pm Monday through Friday) support with a 4 hour incident response time (hardware and software.)
Our same-day support offering provides a coverage window of 8:00 am to 9:00 pm, which is longer than requested, but begins one hour later. Will this service-level be acceptable? 
Response: Yes
If not, we will propose 24x7 support. Both provide 4-hour response for onsite hardware trouble and 2-hour response for telephone support. 
Response: N/A

2.	WHS/ITMD require’s contractor support to design, procure, install, configure, test, and deploy a replacement for the current environment. The government requires a new production database environment consisting of two servers that will provide redundant pathways to a shared storage array. Furthermore, complete failover capability from one server to another is required in the event the primary is not available. The SUN Solaris and Veritas platforms are utilized in the current WHS enterprise architecture. 
Is the shared storage array described above already in use, or to be GFE? If so, what make and model is it? 
Response: No – that’s to be provided by the selected offeror.
Is a there an existing SAN between the array and the servers? If so, how many FC switches and FC paths are available for this solution? 
Response:  No – there is no existing SAN
Does the shared storage array need to be connected via FC, or is SCSI connectivity acceptable?
Response:  The government has no preference
Is hardware-based RAID required for this array, or will host-based disk mirroring be acceptable?  Given the information provided, a shared SCSI JBOD would be the most cost-effective storage solution for this cluster
Response:  Hardware-based RAID
Will the government furnish Veritas Cluster Server and any dependent Veritas software, or will that need to be provided with the proposed solution?
Response:  No – that’s to be provided by the selected offeror.
Will any other non-OS software be required with the proposed solution?
Response:  No

3.	The contractor shall ensure that the systems are supporting the following hardware products:
Quad ethernet NIC 10/100/1000 MB speed
2 GB HBAs
Clustered nodes must have a minimum of 16 GB of memory; all others a minimum of 8 GB
SG-XPCI1FC-EM2 - Emulex PCI-X 2 GB Single FC PCI-X Host Bus Adapter
Power is supplied through NEMA L6-30 and NEMA L5-30 sockets

The Emulex FC HBA specified above is specific to Sun. Will a comparable 2GB FC HBA that is supported on additional hardware platforms be acceptable? 
Response: This is a SUN specific solicitation.

4.	DELIVERABLES AND SCHEDULE:

Deliverables Schedule
1 Hardware delivery 2 weeks after award
2 Setup and configuration 3 weeks after award
3 Software installation and testing 4 weeks after award
4 On-site technical support for 5 days (Mon - Fri) After final testing
5 Post-sales customer service After government acceptance
Does the Post-sales customer service requirement (#5) include support for the application stack, or just for the hardware and operating system? 
Response:  application stack, hardware, and operating system
 
5.	Will the licenses that need to be installed on the new servers be transferred or will they be new licenses?
Response:  The licenses will be transferred

6.	Once the configuration is tested and documented, what additional post sales customer support is required for one year?  
Response:  Ownership of any problems with the overall system


7.	What are the deliverables/expectations, and what are the hours of operation for the customer service position?
Response:  Phone support and/or on-site as needed M-F 8:00am – 5:00pm

8.	Is the 4 hour time frame a response or resolution time?
Response:  Response time

9.	Could you clarify if the Government intends for respondents to include a UPS as part of its technical and cost proposal, (i.e. provide the actual component) or if the Contractor will be able to take advantage of WHS's current UPS backed environment?  ATI respectfully asks for clarification. 
Response:  The UPS is to be provided by the selected offeror in an N+1 configuration as specified in the solicitation.

 
10.	Could you clarify if the Government expects for the storage solution proposed by respondents to only address the current storage requirements of 200 GB, or if the technical and cost solution should also address the anticipated increases of the next year (400 GB) and the yearly estimated increases after FY07.  It is not clear if these increases in storage will be addressed by a separate procurement.  ATI respectfully asks for clarification. 
 Response:  The respondents should address the immediate storage requirements, but ensure the system is scalable to account for the anticipated growth as specified in the solicitation.  As further clarification, the growth should be factored through FY09.

11.   I have a question that may require a technical answer. In regards to section 7 that states, /'One server is for development and the other is for test and evaluation, both are to match the production database server configuration. These servers do not require clustering.'/
Questions:  Should these server match the current production database server or the proposed production database server config?  Specifically do you want a shared storage array or just internal storage?

	D. Factor 4: Price: Not objectively rated, but considered for reasonableness in the best value determination
    
3.	ADJECTIVAL RATING AND STANDARDS SCALE
Each proposal will be rated based on evaluation of each factor using the following Adjectival Rating and Standards Scale:

OUTSTANDING – Very comprehensive, in-depth, and clear response. Proposal consistently meets this standard with no omissions. Consistently high quality performance can be expected.

EXCELLENT – Extensive, detailed response to all requirements similar to outstanding in quality, but with minor areas of unevenness or spottiness. High quality performance is likely but not assured due to minor omissions or areas where less than excellent performance might be expected.

GOOD – No deficiencies in the response. Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without major revisions to the proposal.

FAIR – The response generally meets requirements but there is not expectation of better than acceptable performance. Deficiencies are confined to areas with minor impact on performance and can be corrected during negotiation without major revisions to the proposal.

POOR – The response fails to meet one or more requirements. Deficiencies exist in significant areas but can be corrected during negotiations without major revisions to the proposal or serious deficiencies exist in areas with minor impact.

UNACCEPTABLE – Serious deficiencies exist in significant areas. The proposal cannot be expected to meet the stated requirements without major revisions. The proposal only indicates a willingness to perform in accordance with the requirements document without specifying how or demonstrating the capability to do so. Only vague indications of the required capability are present.

4.	BEST VALUE EVALUATION METHODOLOGY:

Best value evaluations is, in and of itself, a subjective assessment by the Government of the proposed solution that provides the optimal results to the Government, price and other factors considered, Subjectivity is inherent in the process and is the cornerstone of the source selection decision. In an effort to provide insight to the offerors as to the decision making process of the Government, the following information is provided:

Evaluation will be made on two factors – Technical and Price. In the evaluation, technical is significantly more important than price. While price is not as important as Technical, it does have significance to the Government.

In rating the technical proposals, the three factors (Technical Understanding, Professional Qualifications, and Past Performance) are listed in descending order of importance. Technical Understanding is moderately more important than the other two factors combined while Professional Qualifications is slightly more important then Past Performance/Corporate Experience.

Your firm’s submission should reflect and demonstrate an understanding of the Statement of Work and provide sufficient detail to be properly considered. Resumes and qualifications of proposed personnel shall also be provided. Your submission should reflect the quality and experience of proposed personnel at competitive fixed prices. The technical proposal shall not exceed 25 pages in length and single sided. The technical proposal shall include labor mix and hours, but not labor rates. During the technical evaluation, the labor mix and hours, not labor rates, will be evaluated. Price submissions shall be under separate cover and competitive firm fixed priced. Other Direct Costs proposed shall be realistic to the extent that all costs/prices can be fully supported. Resumes, and past performance do not count towards the page limitation. Email is the preferred method of submission.

Contract employees who work on this contract must be knowledgeable and where appropriate follow the Department of Defense procedures to clear information for public release through the Department of Defense Office of Freedom of Information and Security Review.   

6. BACKGROUND
WHS/ITMD currently has two Hewlett-Packard servers.  One is a production server and the other is a development server.  These servers have reached their end of life cycle and need to be replaced.  

Production Database Server

The production environment consists of one HP 9000 N400 (N Class) server primarily running HP-UX 11.0 with Oracle 8.1.7 databases that support a variety of custom applications as well as COTS products such as RESUMIX, Business Objects, and TrackIt.

Hardware Platform:  The current server configuration for the N Class server is as follows: two 36 GB internal disks, eight 36 GB Surestore disks, DVD ROM, two Single Port Ultra 2 SCSI HBA’s, three 800 MHz processors, 4 GB of RAM, one 100Base-T LAN adapter, one DDS3 DAT tape drive, rack mounted HP PowerTrust II-MR 4 kW (4.5 kVA) UPS 240v, which are installed in two HP9000 Standard Rack System E41.  The current operating system installed on the server is HP-UX 11.0 with an unlimited user’s license and is not clustered.  

Software Platform:
The HP-UX development environment consists of Oracle 8.1.7 and 9.x.  Backups are performed by CommVault Galaxy version 5.9.0.

Current Usage:  200 GBs of local storage to support the databases with an anticipated increase next year of 400 GBs.  Furthermore, the government anticipates a growth rate of 15 percent per year after FY07.  There four Oracle database instances which serve 36 concurrent users.  On average there are 100 sessions active at any given time with a peak of 200.   

Development Database Server

The development environment mirrors the production environment as stated above.

Production Web Server

Hardware:  The production web server is a Sun Fire 280R that has two 900 MHz processors, 4 GBs RAM, and two 72 GB internal hard drives.  It is running SUN Solaris 8.0.

Software:  Apache 1.3.31, Oracle Client 9.2, CommVault Galaxy version 5.9 (client), OpenSSL 0.9.7i, OpenSSH 4.2p1, mod_perl 1.0, mod_ssl 2.8.25 and later.
 
Current Usage:  60 GB of disk space is currently being consumed.  This server houses a publicly accessible web site that receives approximately 25 K hits per day.  The present server meets the current usage requirement.  However, the government anticipates a 10 % increase each year after FY07.

7.	REQUIREMENTS
WHS/ITMD requires contractor support to design, procure, install, configure, test, and deploy a replacement for the current environment.  The government requires a new production database environment consisting of two servers that will provide redundant pathways to a shared storage array.  Furthermore, complete failover capability from one server to another is required in the event the primary is not available.  The SUN Solaris and Veritas platforms are utilized in the current WHS enterprise architecture.  
The government requires two additional servers.  One server is for development and the other is for test and evaluation, both are to match the production database server configuration.  These servers do not require clustering.
