Should the contractor assume there is a large enough feed to the facility to add the 100 amp panel? Please clarify the UPS size. Did you mean you wanted a 3KVA UPS? (the specified 3000 KV would be a data center sized UPS, I've never seen a 120VAC version, and it could power a small city) Should we assume the you want to back up the cameras, DVR, and monitors? How long did you want the UPS run time to be?
ANSWER - This is to clarify the UPS requirements for the St. Croix CCTV system. The 3000KVA requested is erroneous. Vendor  should provide an APC Smart UPS, 1000VA, Tower UPS or similar<BR><BR>
