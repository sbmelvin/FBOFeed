<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for microspheres 300 mm or smaller, partially filled with water.  These microspheres are to be embedded and uniformly distributed within a polymeric material.  The specific heat of the resulting composite material is to be measured and the data and specimens delivered to NASA.  The Contractor will be required to prepare a composite material comprised of water-containing microcapsules uniformly dispersed in a polymeric matrix.  The specific requirements are as follows: 1)The microcapsules are to be no larger than about 200-300µm, but can also be substantially smaller than about 200µm. 2)The microcapsules will have a core-shell morphology with the core comprising as much volume as possible of the total capsule. 3)The capsule shell should be compatible with the polymeric matrix of the composite, compatible with water, withstand operating temperatures of about 20-400°F (-10 - 200°C), and pressures of about 275psia at 400°F.  However, some of these materials requirements may not be strictly required in implementation to achieve desired composite performance. 4)The capsule core will be comprised of water and vapor in various ratios ranging from mostly water to mostly vapor.   5)The matrix material should withstand operating temperatures of about 20-400°F (-10 - 200°C) and internal pressures of about 275psia.  The materials should further be able to withstand thermal cycling over the given temperature range for 3-5 cycles and a sustained period at maximum cycle temperature of about 30minutes. 6)Develop methods of preparing composite layups so that the microcapsules are uniformly dispersed in the matrix. 7)Characterize the thermal property measurements of formulated composites over the temperature range of 20-400°F (-10 - 200°C). Deliverables shall be as follows: 1) 3 samples of solid matrix material 2) 3 samples of matrix containing hollow microspheres 3) 3 samples of matrix containing ~50% volume water-filled microcapsules. 4) Characterization information of all materials The contractor shall deliver the samples to NASA LaRC not later than six (6) months after receipt of order (ARO). Deliverables shall be as follows: NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the microspheres from Southwest Research Institute, as they are the only known source capable of satisfying agency requirements.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item identified below, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number 14-3k47-03, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-12. The NAICS code is 334516, with a small business standard of 500 employees.  The Government intends to negotiate non-competitively with MACS , Dr. William McClure, North Carolina University Raleigh, North Carolina 27695-7625, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253© (1) when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency’s minimum needs can only be satisfied by  one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy the agency requirement. The Portable NIR meter (PNIRM) System and components are sole source because no other companies have been located that build instruments of this type that are filter based, near-infrared covering a range up to 2500 nm of this size.  The MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS for the PNIRM are as follows: develop a portable NIR meter (PNIRM) for determining nitrogen levels in manure samples.  The PNIRM is an intermediate development leading to a small hand-held NIR meter.   This phase is needed to adapt the gap-second derivative technology for manure samples (including circuit design, wavelength selection, calibration, software embedding, and sample preparation and field evaluation). The PNIRM must be calibrated in the laboratory and have the capability to be hooked to a computer for storing calibration data for calibration.  Once the calibration is downloaded, the PNIRM may be disconnected from the computer for field operation.  The primary objective is to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the Gap-second derivative technique for determining nitrogen in manure samples. The PNIRM, unlike other filter instruments, must be able to accommodate up to 10 filters permitting the calculation of a minimum of three calibration gap-second derivatives.  The potential exists for additional gap-second derivatives depending on the sensitivity of wavelength information.  The PNIRM must be able to utilize an evacuated and cooled lead sulfide (PbS) and be able to operate in the reflection mode.  Selection of wavelengths (filters) for the instrument will be based on analysis of spectra already acquired by the Animal Manure and By-Products Laboratory of USDA.  Circuitry is needed to determine the filter positions, read each filter and store the intensity data to be used in calculating the gap-second derivatives. The PNIRM requires both interface and embedded software to operate in the “calibration” (CM) and “stand alone” (SAM) modes. In the CM, the PNIRM must be able to be connected to a computer for uploading data and downloading calibrations.  This must be accommodated via. RS232 protocol.  Once the calibration equation is downloaded, the PNIRM must be able to determine and store the nitrogen content of manure samples, operating independently of the computer. It must have the capability to store up to 107 manure samples for calibrating and testing.  The total data set will need to be divided as follows: 107 samples for calibration and additional samples will be acquired for validation.  Performance of the meter must be reported in terms of the standard error of calibration (SEC), standard error of validation (SEV), coefficient of variability (CV) and bias.  The delivery is FOB destination (including inside delivery) to Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, Maryland.  Delivery is required one year after award.  This solicitation incorporates the following FAR clauses, provisions, and addendums: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items; 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items; 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items; and 52.247-34 F.O.B. Destination.

<DESC>Fisheries play a key role in the social and economic life of the Philippines—providing employment, essential nutrition and even tourism enterprise opportunities for a rapidly expanding, predominantly coastal population.  Yet numerous signs indicate that this valuable resource is threatened by overfishing, destructive and illegal fishing.  Catch per unit effort has declined dramatically.  The catches of small, subsistence fishers have dropped, and some experts have begun to warn of a possible crash of selected stocks in as little as ten years. 

This situation is largely due to the absence of rational national and local fisheries management policies and plans.  This places marine fisheries and coastal resources under a de facto open access regime.  This tragedy of the commons is due to the lack of individual property rights and effective regulation.  Degradation of habitats and depletion of fish stocks is due to the use of high volume, non-discriminatory commercial fishing methods, destructive fishing methods – cyanide for live fish trade, bottom trawling and dynamite, and the lack of policies and programs geared toward sustainable use and the inability of responsible government agencies to effectively enforce fisheries-related laws.  If this situation is not addressed, declining (and potentially crashing) fish stocks could lead to further biodiversity and economic losses, food insecurity, increased conflict over dwindling supplies of fish, deepening poverty, and a deteriorating quality of life for fishing communities.  
The primary purpose of the Fisheries Improved for Sustainable Harvest (FISH) Project is to conserve biological diversity in at least four biologically and economically important coastal and marine ecosystems in the Philippines as measured by an increase in marine fish stocks.  The Project will accomplish this by improving the management of these marine fish stocks and the coastal resources – mangroves, coral reefs, sea grass and other valuable habitats – that support the production of coastal and marine fish stocks.  The four target ecosystems are: the Calamianes Islands in Palawan; Danajon Reef in Bohol; and  Tawi-Tawi and Surigao del Sur, both in Mindanao. (See Annex 1)  The FISH Project will support the efforts of the Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DA-BFAR) and selected local government units (LGU) to conserve biological biodiversity in the selected areas. 
This innovative, seven-year initiative will take a holistic approach, focusing on an entire ecosystem in developing and implementing management plans, improving policies and raising public awareness and political commitment.  Expected result is an increase in marine fish stocks by at least 10% from current baselines in targeted coastal and marine ecosystems within seven years, helping to achieve the Mission’s strategic objective of protecting productive and life sustaining natural resources.  Given the time required to mobilize an implementation team, establish baseline information levels, and build consensus among key stakeholders to implement management actions, Mission staff consider seven years a reasonable time to achieve the target results.

Technical assistance provided through one or a number of US and/or local organization(s) will: 1) strengthen the capability of local and national institutions to manage marine fish stocks and coastal resources; 2) improve local and national policies for more sustainable use of marine fish stocks and coastal resources; and 3) build the political will to advocate for more responsible management of marine fish stocks and coastal resources. Management interventions may include controls on issuance of fishing licenses, licensing of commercial vessels by LGUs, improved enforcement of municipal waters, establishment of marine protected areas and/or seasonal catch limits for selected species.  In order to address the issue of open access to coastal resources and marine fish stocks, the project will support the development and enforcement of individual or common property resource use rights. 
  
USAID anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursable contract for the seven year program beginning on or about October 1, 2003.  Detailed information about this solicitation is contained in the RFP documents that will be available on or about April 24, 2003 on this website.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to award on a sole source basis under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to LOGOS, INC.  3101 New Mexico Avenue, N.W.  Suite 253  Washington, DC  20016 (a woman owned business) NTE $50,000.00 for consultant technical review, advice, and assistance services for development of additional versions(s) of the entry-level economist assessment.  

STATEMENT OF WORK:  The BLS entry level economist assessment was developed in 2000-2001 and implemented in early 2002 for selection of entry-level economists.  It is a job-related cognitive test for selecting new employees, developed by Logos, Inc. (a contractor), based on the logic-based measurement (LBM) model.  It is fully compliant with the various legal, technical, psychometric, and professional standards for the development of psychological tests used for employment selection.  Two versions are currently in use, both developed by the contractor.  Additional versions are needed for reasons of test security.  Having multiple versions of an employment test is standard practice in the testing industry.  Two more versions of this test are to be produced in the present effort.  The second (version 4) is to be a derivative of the other (version 3).  

Tasks and Objectives of the Technical Review and Analysis Services  

The Bureau plans that in-house staff will write the individual items and construct the new versions of the assessment.  These will follow the LBM model and be similar to the two existing versions now in use.  The current in-house staff will be responsible for preparing the test plan for both versions, consistent with the test plans of the earlier versions; drafting all the items in accordance with technical principles, standards, and practices; and assembling the full assessment instrument.  The in-house staff will work to prepare new versions within the framework of the LBM model, the job analytic information, the taxonomy of logical reasoning, and the test documentation report previously generated in connection with development of the first two versions of the assessment.  The contractor’s role is to provide technical review, advice, and assistance regarding the quality of the individual items and the overall construction of the assessment instruments.  The contractor will be responsible for reviewing the items drafted by the internal staff, suggesting revisions in writing, if pertinent, offering advice about the assessment assembly and construction, and reviewing the fully assembled assessment instrument.  The contractor-provided services shall include advice and written comment on the individual items for phrasing and conformity to the rules of formal logic underlying the individual questions, the adequacy of the coverage of the domain of the logical reasoning construct, and the overall assembly and construction of the assessment instruments.  It will also cover any special technical problems associated with development of the derivative version (i.e., version 4).  

Timetable and Deliverables

The contractor’s work shall be divided into deliverable work packages to provide a timetable of deliverables.  Versions 3 and 4 of the assessment instrument each comprise two parts, Logical Reasoning (Part A) and Quantitative Reasoning (Part B).  It is most convenient to make four deliverables, one for each part of the two versions.  “Deliverables” constitute written reviews and comments on all submitted materials.  The Bureau plans to begin using the two new versions of the assessment in calendar year 2004.  Contractor work shall commence in spring 2003 and take about six months.  The sequence and work interval allotted to produce the deliverables shall be as follows:  

  <>  Review of the initial test plans within three weeks of receipt.  

  <>  Review of the in-house draft of the logical reasoning part of version 3 within one month of receipt.  

  <>  Review of the in-house draft of the logical reasoning part of version 4 within one month of receipt.  

  <>  Review of the in-house draft of quantitative reasoning part of version 3 within one month of receipt.  

  <>  Review of the in-house draft of quantitative reasoning part of version 3 within one month of receipt.  

  <>  Comments on fully assembled version(s) within three weeks of receipt.  

After consultation with the contractor, the Bureau reserves the right to alter the sequence of the deliverables, if that is deemed more efficient and beneficial to BLS.  

The contractor shall participate in a reasonable and limited number of ad hoc meetings or telephone consultation sessions and provide written comments on proposed test questions drafted by in-house staff before in-house staff submits drafts of full sections for formal review.  Also, the contractor shall provide technical information for or participate in one or two-day sessions of internal or external review panels.  For planning purposes, the total amount of contractor time for these activities is not expected to exceed two or three workdays for each panel, with no more than two panels total.  

This notice of intent is not a request for offers.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All interested parties may express their interest to the Contracting Officer by the due date of this notice of intent either by e-mail, or facsimile at 202-691-6026.  If there are no affirmative written responses received within fifteen (15) calendar days from the published date of this notice, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will proceed with the award.  This notice is for information purposes only.  No solicitation will be available.

The strategy for this acquisition may change prior to final RFP release.  We are seeking qualified large and small businesses, 8(a) concerns, SDB contractors, historically underutilized businesses, women-owned businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions under NAICS Code 561210 (Size Standard $23 million) to participate in this Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 Cost Comparison study.  The study will consist of looking at all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform seventeen selected service functions, identified below, for the 81st Training Wing at Keesler AFB, MSThis request for proposals is part of a Government cost comparison study pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, as implemented by FAR 52.207-2, the OMB A-76 Revised Supplemental Handbook, and Air Force Instruction 38-203, Commercial Activities Program.  This study is conducted to determine whether accomplishing the specified work under contract (private) or by in-house (public) performance is more economical.  If in-house performance is determined to be more economical, this request for proposals will be canceled and no contract will be awarded.  There will be two steps leading to the determination to either award a contract or retain the requirement for in-house performance.  The first step is the selection of the best value contractor?s proposal to compare with the in-house cost estimate.  The second step is the comparison of the best value proposal and in-house cost estimate with a final decision to either award a contract or retain the work for Government performance.  AETC is considering setting aside for small business several of the functions (Little BOS), in which case a separate award would be made to a small business firm for these areas, with the remaining functions falling under a separate contract award (Big BOS).  Two separate Government bids will be prepared, one representing the Big BOS areas and the second representing the Little BOS areas. There are four possible award scenarios:  Both Big BOS and Little BOS may go contract, both Big BOS and Little BOS may remain in-house, Big BOS may be contracted out while Little BOS remains in-house, or Big BOS may remain in-house while Little BOS is contracted out.  THIS COST STUDY WILL NOT RESULT IN A CONTRACT AWARD IF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE IS CONSIDERED MORE ADVANTAGEOUS.

<DESC>This acquisition is being offered for full and open competition subject to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 238110 and Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 1771 with a size standard of $12 million.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Disabled Veteran Small Businesses, and HUBZone Certified Businesses are encouraged to participate.  The project is located at F.E. Warren AFB, WY.  The Contractor shall furnish their proposal of effort to provide all plant, labor, materials, and equipment and perform all required work to repair the launcher closure door rail support system at two launch facilities in Weld County and one launch facility in Logan County, Colorado.  Specifically, the launch facilities to be repaired are Lima-06 (L-06), Mike-09 (M-09), and Mike-11 (M-11). Each launcher closure door rail support system consists of reinforced concrete cantilever beams, concrete slab on grade and imported soil material.  The support systems at each of the sites have exhibited various signs of distress.  These include cracking of the beams, and for several of the support systems, displacement of the slab is also evident.  Because of these distresses, at least two of the closure doors will not open completely, due to interference from the displaced slabs.  To deter further failure and maintain the integrity of the LF support system, it is necessary to repair the beams and the concrete slab.  The scope of work includes, but not limited to, removal/replacement of portion of concrete slab (portion removed varies), removal/replacement of top 6” of support beams, removal/replacement of portion of support beams (L-06 only), adjustment of LF rails, excavation, installation of two dewatering wells and adding and compacting structural fill.  Contract personnel shall be currently licensed in their field of expertise in the State of Colorado.  All work shall be performed in accordance with Weld County, Colorado regulations and any applicable state and federal regulations.   All Logan and Weld County, Colorado, applicable state and federal permits (with the exception of the Permit to Construct), will be provided by the Contractor.  The performance period shall be 45 days (level one repair) to 60 days (level two repair) per site.  Two sites are considered level one repair while the other one is considered level two repair for a total performance period of 150 calendar days.  There is a winter exclusion period for this project.  Magnitude of this project is between $250,000 to $500,000.  The negotiation technique to be utilized for the contemplated award of the issued solicitation is a Request for Proposal-Performance Price Trade-Off (PPT).  Under PPT, past performance will be evaluated.   Issue date for this solicitation is anticipated to be on or about 1 to 15 May 2003 with closing date 30 calendar days after issuance.  This solicitation will be available via the Internet at the following address: http://www.eps.gov.  At the home page select the EPS for Vendors.  A series of indexes will follow requiring these selections:  USAF – Offices: Air Force Space Command – Offices; 90 CONS – Posted Dates.  Active solicitation will be listed in accordance with their date of issuance.  When solicitation is downloaded, it is important to read the solicitation COMPLETELY, as there are DATES that MUST be met by the prospective offeror in order for their proposal to be considered responsive.

<DESC>The Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), DHHS is soliciting offers from organizations with the expertise to establish an Animal Studies Consortium. The Animal Studies Consortium will be one of three components of an Atopic Dermatitis Vaccinia Network.  The Network will have three components:  a Clinical Studies Consortium, an Animal Studies Consortium, and a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center.  Each component will be synopsized individually and awarded under a separate contract.  This notice is soliciting offers for the Animal Studies component of The Network only.  The Animal Studies Consortium will use state-of-the-art technology to define the functions of the immune system in mice or other animal models of atopic dermatitis (AD), and then to determine the immune response of these mice to vaccinia and surrogate viruses.  These studies should provide important information for the future design of safer and more effective vaccines for AD patients.  The tasks that the Animal Studies Consortium must fulfill will be coordinated with the Clinical Studies Consortium and the Statistical and Data Coordinating Center.  Organizations capable of fulfilling this effort, at a minimum, must be able to:  1) Establish an Animal Studies Consortium consisting of institutions capable of providing the scientific and administrative expertise necessary to perform studies in animal models of AD.  2) Manage an organizational plan that must include processes for: a) establishing research priorities; b) reviewing, modifying, approving and disapproving research studies; c) allocating resources; d) monitoring and evaluating progress and performance; e) redirecting scientific focus and reallocating resources; and f) establishing and maintaining effective working relationships.  3) Provide input to a Network Executive Committee capable of being the governing body of the Network for all three components. 4) Design protocols and conduct animal studies that:  a) utilize existing and newly developed mouse or other animal models to evaluate immune and gene expression responses following viral challenge with vaccinia or surrogate viruses; and b) correlate the results of these studies with those being performed by the Clinical Studies Consortium.  5) Provide appropriate resources critical to scientific and technical support in a cost-effective manner and be prepared to access bio-containment facilities should the need arise.  6) Ensure an orderly transition of contract-related activities and materials to a successor Contractor or the Government at contract completion.  The Government anticipates the award of a five-year, cost-reimbursement contract in early Fiscal Year 2004.  The solicitation (RFP NIH-NIAID-DAIT-04-07) will be available approximately 15 days after this synopsis is issued at the following address:  http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract (please click on current RFPs to access).  Only electronic copies of the solicitation are available.  The NAICS Code applicable to this requirement is 541710.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.  Subcontracting is encouraged.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to negotiate on a sole source basis for the service of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scans and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, 1111 E. McDowell Road, Phoenix, AZ 85006, under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This is for the study of Brain Regions Involved in Hunger, Taste and Satiety.  The Clinical Diabetes and Nutrition Section (CDNS) of the NIDDK in Phoenix, AZ will recruit the volunteers.  The service provider must be located near the CDNS in Phoenix, AZ.  Good Samaritan Regional is the only source that has been identified in the state of Arizona that can provide the MRI and PET Scans.  Utilization of distant vendors would necessitate the involvement of commercial transportation, taking the volunteer patients out of state.  These costs would increase the unit cost of each scan to an unacceptable amount.  The specific Statement of Work shall be provided with the Request for Quote.  The service will be for a Base Year and with One (1) Option Year.  The Institute intends to purchase the services by other than full and open competition from Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center.  Interested vendors may identify in writing their interest with a capability statement to the Contracting office prior to the closing date of this notice.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received before the closing date of this announcement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  It is anticipated that the Request for Quotation (RFQ) NIH-NIDDK-03-908 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date of the synopsis.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten days (10) after the release of the RFQ.  The anticipated award date is May 9, 2003.  Request for copies of the RFQ must be in writing and may be FAXED to 301-480-4226.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov:  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE:  Proposal Submission Place:  Engr. Sanusi Usman Danbatta, Managing Director, KNARDA, Program Management Unit, KM 9, Hadejia Road, P.O. Box 3130, Kano, Nigeria, Phone: 011-234-64-638-190, Email: KNARDA@yahoo.com:   The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an agro-processing facility in Kano State, Nigeria.  The State Government of Kano, through the Kano State Agriculture And Rural Development Authority (KNARDA), has recently installed a sugar processing plant near the Kano City.  The State Government is keen to convert this plant into an integrated fruit and vegetable processing plant that could maintain year-round operation by processing several fruits and vegetables. 

The current sugar plant is a low technology factory with a milling capacity of about 10 tons of sugar cane  (1.0 to 1.2 tons raw wet sugar) per day.  It is located in an area where small scale irrigated crops, including sugar cane, are produced.  The plant is still in need of some design improvements before it can be put into large-scale production.  It uses simple atmospheric pressure pan boilers with direct heating for evaporation of the cane juice and crystallization.  The condensed liquid with the crystals is centrifuged to separate the wet sugar from the molasses.  A dryer is provided to reduce the moisture content further before marketing.  The expected utilization of the plant is unlikely to exceed four months per year, leaving the basic facility substantially idle for at least eight months, and could thus be available for other products during this period.

The plant, equipment, and management for raw sugar production could be redesigned and expanded into a multipurpose plant that would process fruits and vegetables for canning or other packaging and for producing purees, juices, and pickles for appropriate packaging for the local markets.  In addition to sugar and tomatoes, the following commodities could be considered in the processing operations:  mangoes, okra, beans, corn, baobab, Indian tamarind, pickled carrots, cucumbers, and onions.

Kano State Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (KNARDA) was established in 1982 together with Kano State Agricultural Supply Company (KASCO) as it commercial arm for the execution of a state wide Agricultural Development Programs Project (ADP). The Authority was planned and funded by the federal government of Nigeria, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) and Kano State government of Nigeria. This was intended to provide Kano State with a well coordinated and sustainable approach, to its rural development efforts.

The selected contractor will be responsible for completing the following tasks:

Task 1. Survey the existing facility and equipment, and develop a detailed report with recommendations for improvements. 

Task 2. 

(a) Conduct supply analysis for the fruits and vegetable supply, possible on a staggered year-round schedule. 

(b) Develop options for securing input material (fruits and vegetables) from local or distant markets on a staggered production schedule, taking into consideration the seasonal production of the various fruit and vegetable options in the state, to keep the plant running throughout the year. 

(c) Survey the feasibility of financing and contracting local farmers and large producers. Develop options and prepare recommendations for action. 

Task 3. Conduct demand analysis for all possible products, including markets outside Kano. 

Task 4. Based on the demand and supply, prepare a production plan, including plant design, equipment specifications, water/electricity requirements, and staffing plan. 

Task 5. 

(a) Develop estimates of the yield potential of the possible produce in the local area, and develop agriculture extension options to train local staff for increasing production that could be used in the proposed processing plant.  

(b) Develop public media campaign options that could be used by the State Government and/or the proposed plant to encourage producers to grow the required crops. 

Task 6.

(a) Survey marketing and distribution channels for the products of the plant, and identify options for increasing the channels. 

(b) Determine the practical considerations for organizing producers into producer organizations to facilitate contractual arrangements with a processing plant and scheduling production on a timely basis to satisfy the plant throughput.

Task 7. 

(a) Conduct a financial analysis for the purpose of arriving at the capital and operating costs and the cash flows over at least a ten-year period to satisfy potential investors in the viability of the operation. Develop all required financial projections and a business plan that could be presented to potential investors.

(b) Approach at least two potential investors to confirm their interest, and then prepare proper investor packages that could be used by the project sponsors for approaching potential investors.

Task 8. 

(a) Specify the requirements for foreign management and the long-term development of local management skills, and develop Terms of Reference and procurement documents for hiring a US management firm. Assist the project sponsors in the selection process.

(b) Develop a detailed staffing plan for plant operation and marketing.

Task 9.  Identify health and environment legislative requirements. Develop the required action plans for remedial actions as required. Ensure that the required actions are incorporated in the plant design and equipment specifications.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $116,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

<DESC>Technical POC/Program Manager, Mr. Jonathan C. Gregory, AFRL/IFEC, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4114, telephone: (315) 330-4294, email:  Jonathan.Gregory@rl.af.mil.   Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Arnold J. Kloven, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-4767, email: Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil.  AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the area of information and sensor data analysis technology and associated sensors that will overcome deficiencies and enhance capabilities in existing and planned systems that support law enforcement and corrections efforts and the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center – Northeast (NLECTC-NE.) The NLECTC-NE's mission is to work with government, industry, and academia to identify, evaluate, develop, demonstrate, and assess technology applications for law enforcement and corrections agencies. These efforts include, but are not limited to, concealed weapons detection, audio processing, video surveillance, facial recognition, timeline analysis, communications, communications and information systems interoperability, command and control, mobile and wireless computing, computer forensics, cyber crime, digital evidence handling, school safety, Integrated Border Enforcement Team (IBET), information management, and information storage, retrieval and exploitation. High level overviews of areas of interest for this BAA are in the following paragraphs.  Concealed Weapons Detection (CWD) using either active or passive sensors is a priority for military personnel performing peacekeeping missions, law enforcement officers, and security personnel. Of interest are low cost technologies that can provide portable concealed weapons detection to include weapons with little or no metal content and explosives. Technology which could perform this at a standoff distances of at least ten meters and/or operate autonomously for weapons screening is also of interest.  Also of interest are technologies to perform Through the Wall Surveillance (TWS) and Personnel Location and Tracking (PL&T).  This includes the ability to detect, track and identify moving and stationary targets through building materials and rubble in the case of Urban Search and Rescue (US&R).  Technology development may include those generate a floor plan from outside of a structure as well.  The development of audio processing technologies to allow speaker identification, elimination of noise and/or multiple voices, enhancement and identification of background noise. Video surveillance technologies and tools to enable the acquisition, processing, storage, and enhancement of video data to support law enforcement activities, e.g., facial recognition, identification of individuals, vehicles, events, and interactions.  Timeline analysis technologies to provide both pattern/trend analysis for investigations, and to enhance logistics and planned coverage of regions for increased effectiveness of law enforcement resources. Timeline analysis tools to allow the user multiple customizable ways to display location, time, interaction and event data.  Communications research, development and demonstration of voice and data communications for public safety applications. Communications support voice, data, and "broadband" data (such as real-time video, geographic/map data and overlays, etc.), and can be transmitted via landline, radio frequencies, and/or microwave frequencies, both clear and encrypted. Mobile and wireless computing to provide a local data processing capability giving those in the field users a more responsive and interactive data accessing environment.  Geographic information tools and technologies are increasingly important for law enforcement in coordinating the response of resource and in the analysis of data and discovery of trends/patterns. Geospatial systems integrated into communications networks would assist command and control capabilities by directing messages to those elements which where able to effectively respond. For example, it could increase efficiency by providing information to those who need it, while filtering irrelevant information.  Interoperability is a key element of law enforcement/public safety operations. It is the ability to share/disseminate information to those who need it without impediments created by differing systems, offices, or organizations. Research and analysis of interoperability issues are critical to address early on to provide roadmaps for development and implementation which reduces the conflicts experienced when interfacing with dissimilar systems.  Enhancement of communications systems is an area of interest in this BAA. Communications systems can include private land mobile radio (LMR) systems, commercial services, and/or specialized systems such as wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and satellite communications. Advanced technologies including, but not limited to, software defined radios, voice over IP (VoIP), wireless LAN, 3G wireless data, ultra wideband communications, and mesh networks have the potential to significantly enhance law enforcement and public safety communications; part of this effort is to accelerate the process of transferring these technologies to the law enforcement/public safety market.  Computer Forensics, Cyber-crime: Perform applied research and prototype development in the digital forensic sciences for mission time-critical needs of military and civilian operational networks with spin-offs for the statute-driven law enforcement approach. Explore and apply scientifically proven methods to gather, process, and interpret digital evidence to 1) describe cyber-attack activities, enabling post-attack critical information data and infrastructure restoration, 2) correlate, interpret, and predict adversarial actions and their impact on military operations, and 3) ensure digital data scenario evidence has provable integrity appropriate for military defensive and offensive operations and, possibly, criminal investigations.  Information storage, management, retrieval, and exploitation are technologies that law enforcement, corrections, criminal justice, and public safety agencies increasingly rely upon. The information must be maintained securely while still allowing timely access and updating by multiple agencies/organizations. These systems also need to go types beyond the traditional text based systems to encompass additional and new data types, e.g. audio, video, geospatial. These systems must be able to integrate into the modern computing/networked environment.  Assessments of state-of-the-art of the technologies above will be performed and provided for law enforcement and corrections agencies. Technology demonstrations/evaluations will be accomplished in a real world environment.  Best practices and lessons learned of those evaluations will be fed back to technology development programs and disseminated to the criminal justice community.  In some cases, AFRL Rome may be able to provide further information. Contact the technical POC. The successful application of these approaches will require a broad spectrum of expertise, covering hardware, software, and systems technology.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.

This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 08.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: a) The scientific/technical merits of the proposal, b) the innovation displayed by the proposed solution, c) the reasonableness of the cost for the proposal, and d) other factors, e.g., performance on other recent/current Government contracts and assessment of the probability to successful completion of the effort based on technical capability and work capacity.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal which shall be considered.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.  Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start approximately the third quarter of FY03.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 60 months with dollar amounts ranging between  $100,000 to $2M per year.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:  FY 03 - $7.4M; FY 04 - $8.4M; FY 05 - $8.4M; FY 06 - $8.4M; FY 07 - $8.4M and; FY 08 - $8.4M .  The Government anticipates awarding 25-35 contracts over the life of this BAA.  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49.4M.  An informational briefing/industry day is not planned. Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to the appropriate level of information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst (NAWCADLKE) has been tasked to initiate a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Bell-Boeing Joint Program Office, Patuxent River, MD, specifically, Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc..  Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. is part of the joint program office of Bell-Boeing.  The proposed BOA shall cover all peripheral equipment, including provisioned items for repair of repairables, spare and repair parts, technical manuals, support equipment, miscellaneous logistics support services and data for these items as they become necessary for the program are also included.  The Government intends to negotiate this BOA under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Bell-Boeing is the sole designer, developer, and original equipment manufacturer of the V-22 aircraft.  Bell-Boeing remains the only Support Equipment designer/integrator that has all the required proprietary rights and nondisclosure agreements necessary to design, develop and manufacture Organizational (O) and Intermediate (I) Level Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE).  As part of this effort, Bell Boeing will be required to integrate changes to the PSE (both safety of flight and ECP/VECP) that are identified on the aircraft contract.  While drawings do exist for some of these items, no other source has sufficient technical data, drawings, software, combined aircraft and PSE expertise, as well as trained technical personnel to fully integrate the required PSE with the aircraft platform.    All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which may or may not be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Compilation and data analysis services for gas-phase, capillary-column retention index reference data for use with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Mass Spectral Library are sought for the Physical and Chemical Properties Division (PCPD) of the Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory.   The NIST Mass Spectral Data Center of the PCPD has built of Retention Index Collection (RIC) for use with the NIST Mass Spectral Library to increase the confidence in the identification of chemical substances represented in the Library.  The RIC now contains approximately 70,000 data values of 20,000 compounds measured on commonly available, non-polar capillary columns. Most of this data originated from papers appearing in the chemical literature.  This contract is intended to assist in the enhancement of this collection in the following ways:  1) keep the collection up to date by identifying and abstracting recently published papers containing relevant retention data;  2) convert reported relative retention data presently in the NIST collection to retention indices by selecting reference values present in, or estimated from values in the collection; 3) verifying the quality of any mass spectral data associated with retention data in the original publications; and 4) examine the reliability of both literature values that have been identified as suspect using NIST data analysis software as well as estimated values for important compounds in the Mass Spectral Library whose retention indices have not been measured.  Each year, approximately 300 papers containing gas phase retention data acquired on commonly available columns appear in the literature.  A more thorough description of the requirement will be in the Statement of Work in the solicitation.  This requirement requires a thorough, molecular level understanding of the factors determining the magnitude of gas-phase retention indices in order to find and fix data problems.  The analysis of data will require the use of existing knowledge concerning trends of known retention indices for related homologous series as well as retention indices for structurally similar compounds.  It also requires the assessment of whether observed differences in retention indices are reliable for different conditions and compounds.   In addition, it will also require an understanding of fragmentation mechanisms of mass spectrometry as well as the combined use of retention indices and mass spectral patterns to identify chemical substances.  The period of performance is a base year and 2 option years. An award will be made using FAR Part 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The solicitation, SB1341-03-R-0007 will be issued on or around January 31, 2003. The competitive solicitations, solicitation amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.   All responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The strategy for this acquisition may change prior to final RFP release.  We are seeking qualified large and small businesses, 8(a) concerns, SDB contractors, historically underutilized businesses, women-owned businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions under NAICS Code 561210 (Size Standard $23 million) to participate in this Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 Cost Comparison study.  The study will consist of looking at all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform seventeen selected service functions, identified below, for the 81st Training Wing at Keesler AFB, MSThis request for proposals is part of a Government cost comparison study pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, as implemented by FAR 52.207-2, the OMB A-76 Revised Supplemental Handbook, and Air Force Instruction 38-203, Commercial Activities Program.  This study is conducted to determine whether accomplishing the specified work under contract (private) or by in-house (public) performance is more economical.  If in-house performance is determined to be more economical, this request for proposals will be canceled and no contract will be awarded.  There will be two steps leading to the determination to either award a contract or retain the requirement for in-house performance.  The first step is the selection of the best value contractor?s proposal to compare with the in-house cost estimate.  The second step is the comparison of the best value proposal and in-house cost estimate with a final decision to either award a contract or retain the work for Government performance.  AETC is considering setting aside for small business several of the functions (Little BOS), in which case a separate award would be made to a small business firm for these areas, with the remaining functions falling under a separate contract award (Big BOS).  Two separate Government bids will be prepared, one representing the Big BOS areas and the second representing the Little BOS areas. There are four possible award scenarios:  Both Big BOS and Little BOS may go contract, both Big BOS and Little BOS may remain in-house, Big BOS may be contracted out while Little BOS remains in-house, or Big BOS may remain in-house while Little BOS is contracted out.  THIS COST STUDY WILL NOT RESULT IN A CONTRACT AWARD IF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE IS CONSIDERED MORE ADVANTAGEOUS.  The Big BOS includes service areas 1 ?14 (listed below) and the Little BOS includes service areas 15-17.

<DESC>NA NA This update notice attempts to identify additional sources for a future competitively solicited, firm-fixed price, IDIQ contract in support of the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio Systems (SINCGARS). Award will be made to the lowest priced, tech nically acceptable proposal. The awarded contract will be a one-year, IDIQ type contract with four one-year options. The contractor shall provide various generations of SINCGARS Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs) and spares (replaceable subassemblies and parts of end items that are normally stocked by CECOM item managers at government depot) that were originally designed and produced by General Dynamics Land System (GDLS). A list of the deliverable spare parts, as well as SRUs, is available  (additional items ma y be added at a later date). A Technical Data Package (TDP) exists. Additional engineering efforts may be required by prospective contractors in order to successfully produce these items. Potential bidders shall have demonstrated capabilities in manufactur ing and redesigning multi-layer circuit cards to eliminate obsolescence, and conduct system level testing with tactical net radios or similar equipment. Obsolescence management and configuration management will be the contractor’s responsibility. These add itional efforts shall not be separately priced, and therefore are built into the unit price of each of the NSNs on contract. OBSOLESCENCE MANAGEMENT: Obsolescence will be transparent to CECOM. The effect of obsolescence and/or obsolescence issues will be t he responsibility of the contractor to control. The contractor shall be responsible for planning for obsolescence; initiating minimum buys of parts, buyouts, re-qualifications of part substitutes, and any necessary redesigns, while maintaining the contract ed delivery schedule and firm-fixed price of each item. During any redesign effort, modernization should be pursued to improve performance and schedule, and reduce the Government's Total Ownership Cost. Several of CECOM's goals are (but not limited to): im provement in the reliability repairs, reduction in the number of components and spares, increase in the use of commonly available commercial parts, and reduction in Production Lead Time. Any new designs shall be qualified, at a minimum, at the system level  for compatibility with all  equipment (including TMDE), and all configurations already fielded, and shall be the responsibility of the contractor to ensure this hardware and software compatibility. The form, fit, and function of the equipment will be main tained. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT: CECOM intends to release the configuration control of the SINCGARS technical data to the contractor. With the exception of INFORSEC related items, the contractor shall be responsible for all the changes and updates to the drawings without requiring CECOM's approval. A CECOM representative, such as a QAR, COR, or other member deemed necessary, shall be provided copies of the approved internal Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) (or contractor change document) and updated (re vised) drawings as they are entered into the contractor's own drawing repository. At any time during the contract period, the technical baseline at the contractor's facility shall be the same as at CECOM's. The drawings provided at the time of award will s erve as the initial technical baseline, or the starting point. The Government will provide drawing numbers for contractor configuration control. Updates to the Technical Data Package (TDP) will not have any proprietary designs introduced so that the TDP wi ll remain competitive. These revisions are provided for the offeror's information and are subject to change.  Please response NLT April 30, 2003. In the event that your firm has an interest in bidding this proposed solicitation, request that your response be forwarded to the lead Contract Specialist, Ms Wei Lu-Gin at (732) 427-1416. Your response should include at a minimum your company name, address, cage code, and a technical point of contact.

<ARCHDATE>06172003
<CONTACT>Gail Pitts, 508-233-5921
<DESC>NA The U. S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center/Natick has a requirement for the retrofit of previously produced Modified Improved Reserve Parachute System (MIRPS) Pack Trays (Part No. 11-1-6967-1) and Ripcord Grip Assemblies (Part No. 11-1-4175-1) to conv ert the assemblies to the recently qualified and approved MIRPS-SLCP (Soft Loop Center Pull) configuration. This requirement will be completed as an assembly and not as separate contracts for the separate components (pack tray and ripcord).  The estimated maximum number of MIRPS pack trays and ripcord assemblies required is 70,000 and the estimated minimum is 40,000. The previously produced MIRPS Pack Trays and Ripcord Grip Assemblies are Army Qualified Products List (QPL) 6645.  Therefore, the retrofit will necessarily be an Army QPL 6645 acquisition utilizing best value with possible multiple contracts.  Offerors pre sently qualified to produce the existing MIRPS Pack Tray and the existing MIRPS Ripcord Grip Assembly shall be considered qualified to apply the MIRPS SLCP retrofit to the specific component(s) they are qualified for.   However, a first article will be nec essary.  Non-qualified offerors may pursue qualification for one or both components in accordance with the applicable requirements of MIL-DTL-6645J.  The government will furnish a pack tray and/or ripcord grip assembly with current retrofit drawings to tho se offerors who would like to pursue qualification. All offerors who are not currently qualified will be required to pass QPL testing and approval before contract award.   For information on obtaining qualification, please contact Gail Pitts at 508-233-592 1 or email at gail.pitts@natick.army.mil. Firms will not be reimbursed for any cost associated with  QPL qualification.    Questions may be addressed to Gail Pitts 508-233-5921,  by email gail.pitts@natick.army.mil or data faxed at 508-2333-5286.

<SUBJECT>A--Army Center of Research in Flexible Displays
<SOLNBR>DAAD19-00-R-0010
<RESPDATE>050903
<ARCHDATE>07082003
<CONTACT>Patricia Fox, 919-549-4272
<DESC>NA The Army announces its intention to create and sponsor a university led center to develop flexible display science and technology solutions for the Army Transformation.  The intent of the center is to establish a core capability to address the science and technology for the development of flexible displays in a pre-competitive environment.  The center will establish a university-industry collaboration to find solutions to the critical challenges for flexible display development and manufacturing. Because th is technology has significant dual-use potential, industry participants will have the opportunity to invest dollars and provide personnel to the center; industrial companies would have levels of engagement in the center based on the level of individual co- investment.   The center will be structured to offer free sharing of information obtained in the cooperative environment while appropriately protecting industry-specific intellectual property. The Army is requesting information on capabilities in flexible displays and related technologies to include: substrates and barrier coatings, backplane electronics, electro-optic devices, packaging and testing, and production/manufacturing.   The goal of t he center is to research, develop and manufacture flexible displays in limited numbers, producing 4 inch to 6 inch displays along with performing the applied research and development to achieve larger display sizes.  The statement should include informatio n on existing capabilities and related projects, to include staff, expertise, and infrastructure.  Background  The US Army is responding to the needs for the Army Transformation of information displays by sponsoring a Flexible Display Initiative (FDI) from FY04-FY09.  The Army FDI is aimed at the development of emissive and reflective flat panel displays on flexibl e substrates.  Displays are a critical element in many electronic devices, serving as the human-machine interface. Sophisticated electronic devices require displays that can faithfully transmit all the information available in a visually rich manner. To me et this need, displays come in various forms with the two dominant types of displays being the cathode ray tube and flat panel liquid crystal displays. Current state of the art is flat panel displays manufactured on glass. However, it is possible to replac e glass with plastic substrates and introduce conformal and flexible displays with the additional advantages of lighter weight, ruggedness, low-cost and low power consumption.   Flexible displays could be rolled or folded up when not in use.  They could be  worn and contoured or conformed for the soldier and vehicle platforms.  Flexible displays will allow displays to be ubiquitous, offering significantly enhanced capabilities to interface with electronic devices. This request for information shall be open for a total of 30-days.  Based on the assessment of responses to this RFI, the Army reserves the right to possibly limit the number of parties from which a subsequent proposal may be requested.  Each response must  be typed (with type that is not smaller than 12 point on standard 8 1/2 inch x 11 inch paper with one (1) inch margins, 6 lines per inch).  The responders are advised that their response to the request for information shall not exceed 12 pages (including figures), plus a one-page vita per investigator.  Responses shall include 1 original and 3 copies and must be submitted directly to the following address:  For USPS  U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center  Research Triangle Park Contracting Division  ATTN: AMSSB-ACR (Patricia Fox)  P.O.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS KEESLER AFB BASE OPERATING SUPPORT (BOS) A-76 COST STUDY, PICK-A-BASE.  The information provided is the planned strategy at this time.  The strategy for this acquisition may change prior to final RFP release.  We are seeking qualified large and small businesses, 8(a) concerns, SDB contractors, historically underutilized businesses, women-owned businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions under SIC Code 8744 (Size Standard $20 million) to participate in this Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 Cost Comparison study.  The study will consist of looking at all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform seventeen selected service functions, identified below, for the 81st Training Wing at Keesler AFB, MS.  The A-76 will involve a performance-based, outcome-oriented source selection competition among offerors.  AETC is considering setting aside for small business several of the functions, in which case a separate award would be made to a small business firm for these areas, with the remaining functions falling under a separate contract award.  Two separate Government bids will be prepared, one representing the Big BOS areas and the second representing the Little BOS areas. If the results are to contract out, AETC will award two major contracts?one contract for Big BOS (full and open competition) and the other for Little BOS (100% Small Business Set-Aside).  THIS COST STUDY WILL NOT RESULT IN A CONTRACT AWARD IF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE IS CONSIDERED MORE ADVANTAGEOUS.  The Big BOS includes service areas 1 -11 (listed below) and the Little BOS includes service areas 12-17.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS KEESLER AFB BASE OPERATING SUPPORT (BOS) A-76 COST STUDY, PICK-A-BASE.  The information provided is the planned strategy at this time.  The strategy for this acquisition may change prior to final RFP release.  We are seeking qualified large and small businesses, 8(a) concerns, SDB contractors, historically underutilized businesses, women-owned businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions under SIC Code 8744 (Size Standard $20 million) to participate in this Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 Cost Comparison study.  The study will consist of looking at all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to perform seventeen selected service functions, identified below, for the 81st Training Wing at Keesler AFB, MS.  The A-76 will involve a performance-based, outcome-oriented source selection competition among offerors.  AETC is considering setting aside for small business several of the functions, in which case a separate award would be made to a small business firm for these areas, with the remaining functions falling under a separate contract award.  Two separate Government bids will be prepared, one representing the Big BOS areas and the second representing the Little BOS areas. If the results are to contract out, AETC will award two major contracts - one contract for Big BOS (full and open competition) and the other for Little BOS (100% Small Business Set-Aside).  THIS COST STUDY WILL NOT RESULT IN A CONTRACT AWARD IF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE IS CONSIDERED MORE ADVANTAGEOUS.  The Big BOS includes service areas 1 - 11 (listed below) and the Little BOS includes service areas 12-17.  Please note that AETC has not yet made a decision as to whether the potential acquisitions will be set-aside and thus it reserves the right to determine the appropriate method of procuring the services based upon its analysis and evaluation of the responses to current market research.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCMENT.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS only.  The purpose of the Sources Sought Synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified small business sources for Design Excellence in public engineering for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for replacement of Electrical and Mechanical components, the replacement of the existing fire alarm system, elevator modernization and upgrade the handicap accessibility at the Hale Boggs Federal Building in New Orleans, LA.  NAICS Code is 541310, $4 million.  The design must comply with General Services Administration (GSA) quality standards and requirements.  The facility is approximately 705,347 gross square feet. It is composed of two structures located on a city block bounded by Poydras and Lafayette Streets on the north and south and Magazine and Camp Streets on the east and west. The Courthouse is a six-story structure and the Federal Building is a fourteen story structure. Both structures share a common basement that encompasses the outer limits of each.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is between $15 to $25 million.  The facility was designed by Mathes, Bergman and Associates, Inc. in association with August Perez and Associates, Inc. and was completed with substantial occupancy in early 1976. The unique aspects of the architecture of this period should be considered. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS). Included in the design is the refurbishing of  the main electrical equipment, which includes the switch gear and the motor control centers (MCC), and replacement of two transformers on each floor. The design shall also include the replacement 56 Air Handling Units (AHUs), the conversion of five floors with multi zone air distribution systems with variable air volume air distribution systems, the modernization of all elevators, replacement of the fire alarm system with a completely new fire alarm system, and upgrading the facility handicap accessibility features to meet current code requirements. The design shall include sustainable features. The design shall also include the GSA design standards for secure facilities. The building will be completely occupied during the construction phase. Therefore the design shall be phased so that the tenants can complete their mission without interruption. In developing the project team, the A/E Firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the New Orleans, LA area. The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants.  A Licensed Fire Protection Engineer is required to perform the design for the Fire Alarm System. A/E firms must have performed on similar projects within the past ten years, and completed three projects, which were multi-story buildings (minimum of 4 stories), with a total construction cost exceeding $5 million. The design work for the projects shall have scopes which clearly demonstrate competence in engineering design for office spaces, and mechanical, electrical, elevator, and fire safety and architectural design for handicap accessibility similar in scope to that identified for the Hale Boggs Federal Building.  Interested parties who meet the above requirements are requested to submit a one-page letter of interest to Pam Lackey, Contracting Officer, no later than April 15, 2003.  Letters can be submitted via email to pam.lackey@gsa.gov or by facsimile to (817) 978-7194.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC/WFF is hereby soliciting information about potential sources capable of performing research, development, verification, and transfer of advanced airborne remote sensing and other space and earth related technologies in support of various program areas including Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), Global Carbon Cycle Studies, and Ocean Surface Metric Measurements.  This is an expansion of the Sources Sought Synopsis, RFP5-10112-GBC, released by NASA on January 28, 2003.  Based on the responses received at that time, NASA determined to issue a new synopsis that described the requirement in greater detail.  It should be noted that all field equipment necessary to support the programs, including aircraft, will be furnished by the Government.  Please see the following detailed requirements: Airborne Topographic Mapper:  The ATM, and its preceding flying laser laboratory version, the Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL), have been utilized as research tools to demonstrate the feasibility of performing various tasks in the areas of airborne lidar applications for remote sensing of terrain information to government agencies needing the technology.  The ATM project will require mission planning, instrument development, calibration, mission operation, and data processing and analysis to provide ice and terrain mapping data in support of programs such as the following: measurements of glacier and ice sheet topography in remote areas of the Arctic and Antarctic, including Greenland, the Canadian archipelago, Svalbard, and Alaska and other areas as the need develops; airborne coastal mapping including surveying of large tracks of beaches extending around most of CONUS and additional coastal surveys in other areas of the world that may become of interest as a result of changing focus in earth science programs; measurement of sea ice topography and freeboard including the development of methods to associate the topographic and freeboard measurements with associated sea ice thickness and subsurface morphology; mapping of other areas of geologic interest in support of earth science investigations such as volcanic features of Iceland or other sites including regions of subsidence that may result from programmatic collaboration with investigators from various institutions; high density lidar measurement of oceanic wave fields including methods to mitigate problems associated with mixed returns from the ocean surface and volume; highly precise surveys of segments of ice or land, potentially hundreds of kilometers long, for use in calibration and validation of satellite instrumentation such as the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS).  The measurement of the glaciers, ice sheets, and coastal areas will all involve the capability to repeat flight lines over the targets to establish net changes in surface morphology and height related to regional climate change (ice) and coastal processes (coastline).   Satellite data, such as from GLAS, is planned to be used to study elevation change of ice sheets by comparing both with ATM data and satellite data from earlier years.  The proper use of GLAS data will require analyses to determine instrument pointing errors, timing errors, range bias, and any other data anomalies.  Such analysis will be required throughout the satellite lifetime, but particularly after switches in satellite laser, and can involve data taken over ice and other terrain.  Analytical requirements including relating the ice sheet measurements to patterns of change in the ice sheet including rates of change and discharge in outlet glaciers, the general stability and mass balance of ice sheets and glaciers, and forecasting future rates of change in these parameters.   ATM missions utilize DoD's Satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to derive precise aircraft trajectories essential for determination of individual laser spot elevations, and Glonass data may be added for some future missions. The ice surface measurements in particular involve large separation distances between the location of the staging airport and the survey sites, sometimes in excess of 2,500 km. ATM support requires the development of software for producing trajectories for such missions and determining the number and location (including actual position estimation) of ground tracking stations required to achieve the required accuracy.  Currently, vertical accuracy required for Greenland surveys is 7 cm, including both GPS positioning and laser pointing and measurement errors.  The ATM program has generally utilized aircraft inertial navigation systems (INS) of various types in the computation of laser pointing, but the orientation of the laser system relative to the INS varies from one aircraft installation to another and must be determined.  ATM support includes the development of efficient techniques to determine orientation parameters.  In addition, the full capabilities of a recently installed integrated GPS/INS attitude system need to be determined and exploited. Global Carbon Cycle Measurements Program:  Support for the Global Carbon Cycle Studies Program is categorized into 5 areas as follows: Airborne Oceanographic Lidar Operations; Water Leaving Radiance Modeling; Application of Water Leaving Radiance Modeling to Ocean Color Satellite Imagery;  the Development of Airborne Pump-and-Probe (PP) or Analogous Fast Repetition-Rate (FRR) Methods; and the Laser Laboratory and Calibration laboratory Development and Maintenance.  The Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL) is utilized as a tool for validation of MODIS chlorophyll biomass, CDOM/Gelbstoff (chromophoric dissolved organic matter), and chlorophyll fluorescence line height products in conjunction with planned underflights of the satellite with and without the coordination with research vessels.  In most cases the airborne laser-induced measurements cannot be directly compared to the MODIS products but must be converted into comparable units for successful satellite product validation.  The AOL is maintained by the contractor as a research tool with frequent upgrades to state-of-the-art technology.  The calibration of the AOL is an important factor in the MODIS product validation process. The AOL is generally flown along with a pair of passive hyperspectral radiometers, the Airborne Diode Array Spectrometer (ADAS) and Cosine Diode Array Spectrometer (CDAS) that respectively view the ocean and sky.  The radiance and irradiance measurements acquired with these sensors is used to develop new ocean color algorithms, validate MODIS reflectance measurements, and to trouble shoot deviations between the MODIS products and concurrent product validation measurements made with the AOL.  Instrument calibration procedures and techniques are a key factor in the success of the airborne sensor in these applications along with the preparation of the airborne spectra for comparison with the satellite reflectance spectra.  The calibrated at-aircraft ocean color radiance spectra paired with chlorophyll concentration, phycoerythrin fluorescence and CDOM absorption derived from the analytic activities are the data set for developing, testing, and improving algorithms for retrieving inherent optical properties (IOP's) constituents from the ocean color radiance spectra.    The application of Water Leaving Radiance Modeling to Ocean Color Satellite Imagery;activities include the application of ocean radiance models developed and refined utilizing the airborne ocean color spectra to satellite ocean color imagery to produce wide-area scenes of phytoplankton pigment and CDOM absorption.  Such scenes are routinely expected to be prepared for the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) using higher density Local Area Coverage (LAC) imagery.  Extension of similar scenes to other areas or perhaps globally using lower density Global Area Coverage (GAC) imagery is part of this activity.  This activity includes the development of animated GAC and LAC imagery over periods of time from weeks, months, and even years to provide insight into seasonal and longer term changes in the surface layer IOP's on regional and global oceanic scales. The measurement of primary productivity has become an important component of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise.  According methods to remotely measure related parameters from an airborne platform are an important facet of the research required in the solicitation.  Specifically, the application of advanced Pump and Probe and Fast Pulse Repetition Rate methods that have been demonstrated on lab and shipboard environments to an airborne platform is sought.  Numerous obstacles to the laboratory Pump and Probe and Fast Pulse Repetition Rate methods are inherent in implementation of these methods into an airborne platform.  Careful consideration to the solution of these obstacles is a key element to the potential success of this endeavor. Laser laboratory development activities include the development of advanced techniques for measuring ions in sea water to determine the inorganic carbon content excluding dissolved CO2.	 The development of methodology to extend this capability to aircraft platforms is a component of this program.  Remote sensing measurement of phytoplankton taxonomy has been emphasized by NASA's Earth Science Enterprise.  Techniques for remotely measuring phytoplankton taxonomy using airborne laser spectroscopy are an important component of ongoing research within the Ocean Carbon Cycle Measurements program. Ocean Surface Metric Measurements Program: This program includes the development of radar and laser capabilities for mapping ocean surface features, and includes the acquisition of precise radar and laser ranging data of both ocean surface topography as well as power spectral information derived from the ranging data.  NASA also requires the quantification of radar capabilities to perform terrain mapping as well as determining the biases associated with making ocean topographic measurements with satellite radar altimeters and assistance in expanding the ATM in conjunction with the WFF Multimode Airborne Radar Altimeter (MARA) in both the Scanning Radar Altimeter (SRA) mode, which has superseded the Surface Contour Radar (SCR), and Multibeam Altimeter (MA) mode for satellite missions such as TOPEX/POSEIDON and JASON.   No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should contact the Contract Specialist, Andrew S. Dennis at (757) 824-1066 to schedule a capabilities demonstration at Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia.   Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.	A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Andrew S. Dennis, no later than April 21, 2003.  Please reference RFP5-14861-GBC in any response.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

Question concerning this requirement should be addressed to Ron Sepesi 216.433.2792 or Ronald.W.Sepesi@nasa.gov  Technical question can be addressed to Jeff Swan	216.433.5434 Company profiles should be provided to:  NASA Glenn Research Attn: Ronald Sepesi, MS 500-312 21000 Brook Park Rd. Cleveland, Ohio   44135 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   A detailed description of the Facilities to be operated under the proposed contract includes: 8-by 6-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel The facility enables the collection of data and validate CFD (computational fluid dynamics) prediction codes for shock patterns related to the sonic boom of  baseline and modified aircraft to study concepts that will allow quiet, efficient, and capable long-range supersonic flight. 9'x15' Low Speed Wind Tunnel  Unique in testing large-scale hardware in a continuous subsonic air stream, the 9- by 15-Foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel is a significant asset to the aeropropulsion community and Nation. With the ever-increasing demand for reducing aircraft noise, the importance of the 9- by 15-Foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel is greater than ever. Offering state-of-the-art acoustic capabilities, the facility is a vital part of the Nation's aeronautics research plans. Programs supported in this facility include a variety of commercial aircraft propulsion systems, the High Speed Civil Transport, and the Advanced Tactical Fighter, the Joint Strike Fighter, and other military STOVL aircraft applications. Abe Silverstein Supersonic Wind Tunnel The test section is 10 ft, high by 10 ft. wide by 40 ft. long and can accommodate large-scale models, full-scale engines and aircraft components. The 10x10 was specifically designed to test supersonic propulsion components such as inlets and nozzles, propulsion system integration, and full-scale jet and rocket engines. It can operate as a closed-loop system (aerodynamic cycle) or open-loop system (propulsion cycle), reaching test section speeds of Mach 2.0 to 3.5 and very low speeds from 0 to Mach 0.4. Gust and Mach plates are sometimes installed to expand local Mach number conditions between Mach 1.5 and 4.1. There is also a continuous operation across the entire speed and altitude regime, offering users greater flexibility and productivity during testing. Aeroacoustic Propulsion Laboratory The Aero-Acoustic Propulsion Laboratory (AAPL) is an acoustically treated geodesic dome that houses the Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig (NATR), Small Hot Jet Acoustic Rig (SHJAR), Active Noise Control Fan (ANCF), and Powered Lift Rig (PLR). The 130-ft diameter dome is 65-ft high and acts as a noise barrier for adjacent buildings and nearby communities. For researchers, the dome provides an anechoic testing environment for acoustic measurements of aeropropulsion components. Cryogenic Propellant Tank Facility The Cryogenic Propellant Tank Facility (K-Site) is a space-environment test chamber 25 ft in diameter with a 20 ft-diameter door. The design and construction of this facility allows large-scale liquid hydrogen (LH2) experiments to be conducted safely. Control and data systems are located in a separate, remote building and electrical control systems include explosion-proof hardware. Hypersonic Tunnel Facility The HTF is a blow-down, non-vitiated, free jet wind tunnel that is capable of simulating Mach 5, Mach 6, and Mach 7 true enthalpy conditions. The primary performance differentiator between the HTF and other hypersonic free jet facilities is its non-vitiated (clean) flow. Icing Research Tunnel The Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) is NASA Glenn's busiest facility. Built at the end of World War II, the IRT was instrumental in developing and testing ice protection systems for piston- and propeller-driven aircraft. Since that time, the IRT has been updated with a larger fan motor, more efficient heat exchanger and turning vanes, improved fan blades, computerized tunnel controls, and electronic data acquisition, storage, and processing. Space Power Facility The Space Power Facility (SPF) houses the world's largest space environment simulation chamber measuring 100 ft. in diameter by 122 ft. high. The facility was designed and constructed to test both nuclear and non-nuclear space hardware in a simulated Low-Earth-Orbiting environment. Although the facility was designed for testing nuclear hardware, only non-nuclear tests have been performed throughout its history. Some of the test programs that have been performed at the facility include high-energy experiments, rocket-fairing separation tests, Mars Lander system tests, and International Space Station hardware tests. The SPF is located at the NASA Glenn Research Center at the Plum Brook site. Spacecraft Propulsion Facility (B-2) NASA's Spacecraft Propulsion Facility (B-2) is the world's only facility capable of testing full-scale upper-stage launch vehicles and rocket engines under simulated high-altitude conditions. The engine or vehicle can be exposed for indefinite periods to low ambient pressures, low-background temperatures, and dynamic solar heating, simulating the environment the hardware will encounter during orbital or interplanetary travel.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA intends to award on an other than full and open competition basis, a modification to the above contract, awarded to AIL Systems, Inc./Technical Services Operations, 254 East Avenue K-4, Lancaster, CA 93555-4500, to increase the ceiling level for the second year and the third year of the basic 3 year period, and to also increase the ceiling level for the two one-year option periods.  The contract was originally synopsized on a full and open competitive basis on April 10, 2001.  Award of a time and material indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract was issued to AIL Systems, Inc./Technical Services Operations, on 25 January 2002 for a basic period of three years, with two one-year options.  The procurement is for Validation of Navy air defense and air defense related threat simulations, models and actual threat weapons systems in support of the Navy Threat/Simulation Validation Program. The basic three-year period will be increased by approximately 10,090 labor hours plus material and data costs.  Option period one will be increased by approximately 5,178 labor hours plus material and data costs, and option period two will be increased by approximately 5,027 labor hours plus material and data costs.  The Navy Validation Coordination Office has received request for increased validation of systems due to dramatic changes in the defense simulator development programs.  Each developed threat simulator, simulation, actual threat weapons system, model, surrogate, jammer, command and control system, EO, IR or UV system developed, is required by Department of Defense and Office of Secretary of Defense to be validated before further approvals can be made toward further production and testing.  The reason this is being added to the contract on an other than full and open competition basis, is because AIL Systems, Inc., was determined to be the only technically acceptable/responsible offeror at the time of procurement and the timeframe for re-solicitation of the requirement would have a detrimental impact on the Navy Validation Program Office.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract
<DESC>Notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract with the Makah Tribe for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).  Purpose of proposed contract is to provide estimates for the encounter rates of sub-legal Chinook salmon and non-target salmon in Washington Treaty and non-Treaty troll fisheries using observer and logbook programs.  The Makah fishery biologists manage a major portion of the troll fishery and are very familiar with its conduct and the fishermen that participate in it.  The use of onboard observers on Treaty troll vessels makes up the major portion of this project.  No other source is capable of providing the required estimates due to Makah Tribe's sovereign authority in managing fisheries.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation shall not be issued.  This solicitation number 03X800241 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12, dated January 24, 2003.  This RFQ is to provide automobile rental services to various agencies and employees of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  The period of performance shall be a base year of 3 months, plus 4 - 12-month option periods.

Background: DHHS currently operates motor pools under which Government leased or owned vehicles are provided to employees with a minimum of administrative effort.  DHHS wants to replace the motor pools with the use of rental cars on an as needed basis and wants the rental process to involve a minimum of administrative effort.

Statement of Work: The Contractor shall provide small and mid-size vehicles and mini-vans for use between sites in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  On occasion, a vehicle may be needed for travel to the Baltimore and Philadelphia metropolitan areas.  Rental shall general be one business day; however, overnight travel may be required on an infrequent basis.  It is anticipated that no more than 15 vehicles will be needed at any one time.  However, no minimum number of vehicles per day is guaranteed and vehicle distribution among the three classes of vehicles may not be balanced.

The Contractor shall deliver vehicles to the sites identified below.  A secure parking area will be provided at each site.  Each site will have a secure staffed desk where the Contractor can deposit keys and the paperwork for each vehicle delivered.  The Government will not provide transportation to return rental agency personnel to their work sites.  All vehicles except for overnight rentals will be returned to the secure parking area at the end of the rental period and shall be picked up by the rental agency prior to 6:00 a.m. the next business day.  All vehicles must be cleaned and serviced prior to successive rentals.  In all cases, rental vehicles shall have all required documentation, such as a copy of the contract and registration with the keys and shall be ready for immediate departure by the traveler.

Vehicle drop off points are:

	Program Support Center				National Institutes of Health
	5600 Fishers Lane					1 Center Drive
	Rockville, MD		      and				Bethesda, MD
	Visitor's Parking Lot					B1 Parking Lot

The location of the secured desk at each site will be provided after award.

Mileage and Fueling:  Unlimited mileage is required for each rental vehicle.  The Contractor shall refuel all vehicles.  A review of pricing for fuel shall occur during the third month of each quarter, beginning with the second full quarter in the first performance period.  In conducting a fuel price review, the Government will survey no less than five (5) commercial fueling stations in Rockville, MD, and will determine an average per gallon price for 87-octane fuel.  Fuel prices charged by the Contractor shall not exceed that average.

Ordering of Vehicles:  The Government will notify the Contractor prior to noon the business day before rental vehicles are required.  The notification to the Contractor will include the number and types of vehicles, the location of the drop off, and the earliest time that the vehicle can be dropped off.  The rental period shall not commence earlier than the time identified in the notification for drop off.  There may also be the need to request a "last minute" or emergency vehicle after the deadline mentioned above. 

Authorized Drivers: All Government employees in the vehicle with a valid driver's license shall be authorized to drive the rental vehicle, unless individually restricted by the operator's license.

Liability and other insurance: Government personnel will not be subject to any fee for loss to the vehicle for Collision Damage Waiver, and, in the case of an accident, will not be responsible for the loss or damage to the vehicle, except as stated below.

The Contractor shall maintain in force, and at its sole cost, insurance coverage or a duly qualified self-insurance program, which will protect the United States and its employees against liability for personal injury, death and property damage arising from each use of a vehicle.  Personal injury/wrongful death limits shall be equal to the highest minimum for the state and/or District of Columbia in which the vehicle operates during each rental.  The conditions, restrictions and exclusions of the applicable insurance for any rental shall not be less favorable to the Government and its employees than the coverage afforded under standard automobile liability policies.  Where more favorable terms are available, those terms shall be automatically extended.

Standard coverage shall include mandatory no-fault insurance where required by law.  The Contractor warrants that to the extent permitted by law, the liability and property damage coverage provided are primary in all respects to other sources of compensation, including claims statues or insurance available to the Government, renter or additional authorized driver.  Proof of such insurance shall be provided.

The Contractor assumes and shall bear the entire risk of loss or damage to the rented vehicles (including costs of towing, administrative costs, loss of use and replacements), from any and every cause whatsoever, including, without limitation, casualty, collision, fire, upset, malicious mischief, vandalism, tire damage, falling objects, overhead damage, glass breakage/cracking/chipping, strike, civil commotion, theft and mysterious disappearance, except where such loss and/or damage is caused by one or more of the following:

a.  An accident due to negligence on the part of a Government driver, where there is credible evidence of such negligence, such as a police report citing the driver for a traffic violation.
b.  Obtaining the vehicle through fraud or misrepresentation
c.  Operating the vehicle under the influence of alcohol or any prohibited drugs
d.  Use of the vehicle for illegal purposes
e.  Use of the vehicle in pushing or towing another vehicle
f.  Using or permitting the vehicle to be used for hire
g.  Operating the vehicle in any training maneuver or for any purpose other than that for which vehicles of this type are normally rented by a private citizen
h.  Operating the vehicle in a test, race or contest of any kind
i.  Operation of the vehicle by an unauthorized driver
j.  Operating outside of the United States unless specifically authorized at the time of rental
k.  In the event the vehicle is stolen and the renter cannot produce keys to the vehicle, unless a formal Police report indicates the keys were stolen through some form of theft or robbery
l.  Operating of the vehicle off paved, graded and professionally maintained roads or driveways.

These exceptions are not valid where prohibited by state law.

Vehicles: The vehicles shall be well maintained, insured, properly licensed and clean for each use.  All vehicles shall meet all state and local safety standards, shall be no more than two years old and will have no more than 40,000 miles on the odometer at the time of delivery to the site.  The vehicle shall have a full gas tank at the time of rental, minus whatever gas is consumed in moving directly from the rental location to the drop off point.  Such fuel usage is expected to be negligible.  It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to refuel all rented vehicles.

The Contractor shall provide renters with a 24-hour telephone number for reporting accidents, disabled vehicles and for requesting a replacement vehicle, if necessary.  Inoperative rental vehicles within 25 miles of either the Fishers Lane location or the Center Drive location shall be replaced within two hours.  The renter of a vehicle involved in an accident shall, in all cases, file a police report and provide a copy of that police report to the rental agency and the Government Project Officer.  Renters shall, in addition, complete a rental company accident report, if so requested.

Liaison: The Government will operate a Vehicle Transportation Office (VTO).  This office will order vehicles and monitor changes in fuel costs.  The Contractor shall appoint a liaison as a specific point of contact for this requirement.

Pricing:  Vehicle rates shall operate throughout the performance period.  The Contractor may, at the Contractor's own initiative lower prices or offer special rates that are available to consumers, but may not increase prices.

(Prices shall be quoted on a per vehicle/per daily use basis)
Line	Requirement	Performance Period 1	Performance Period 2	Performance Period 3	Performance Period 4	Performance Period 5

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation, N00173-03-R-CR04, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2001-12 and DFARS Change Notice 20030301. The associated NAICS code is 334119 and small business size standard is 1000 employees. NRL has a requirement for hardware and software preventive and remedial maintenance services for Government owned High Performance Data Archive storage system and associated equipment that is controlled and managed by Advanced Digital Information Corporation (ADIC) proprietary software packages. This requirement has a base period and three option years. The base period is estimated to be from July 1, 2003 through September 30, 2003. Each option thereafter is for one year beginning on October 1 through September 30. The options may be exercised by the Contracting Officer providing written notice any time prior to contract completion. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items is incorporated and the Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: 

TECHNICAL CAPABILITY

     A. Accomplishments

          1. Experience: Number of years in maintenance and repair of Information Technology (IT) equipment; number of years in maintenance and repair of archival storage equipment; number of years maintaining the specific make(s) and model(s) of equipment listed.

          2. Ability of the firm to meet the contract response time such as where will the primary and backup service representative(s) be located and what is the plan for the allocation of backup staff and material resources.

          3. Capability of offeror to support its service personnel:

               a. Ability to furnish replacement parts for the equipment listed in Attachment (2), to meet contract time and quality requirements as demonstrated by the offeror's statements, backup documents regarding sources, availability, 


and accessibility. The method to obtain parts in a timely manner, locations of depots, average time estimate for parts delivery.

               b. Ability to provide technical and supervisory assistance to the field representative when needed as evidenced by the training and experience resume(s) of the assistance personnel.

               c. Ability of the firm to respond to an emergent situation such as what is the firm's plan for allocation of materials and resources should a down time situation become excessive.

     B. Quality Assurance Systems

          1. Offeror must have control systems adequate to ensure satisfactory service performance under the contract. Special attention by the evaluation team shall be given to quality control methods employed by the offeror.


PAST PERFORMANCE

Past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the quality of the work performed or supplies delivered and timeliness of performance or delivery. The evaluation will be based on the information provided by the past performance reports. The evaluation will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, or the proposed project manager or key personnel responsible for major or critical aspects of the requirement. Offerors that have no relevant performance history or for which past performance information is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. The government may begin proposal evaluation prior to receipt of past performance information. If, after completion of proposal evaluation except evaluation of past performance, the contracting officer determines that evaluation of past performance will not affect the outcome of competitive selection, the
Contracting Officer may waive its evaluation in accordance with FAR 15.304(c)(3)(iv). The offeror may utilize the Governments past performance report located at http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/pastperf.htm

PRICE

Proposed estimated price to the government.

The Technical and Past Performance factors are of equal weight. When combined they are more important than price. Options: The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).


Offeror must complete and submit with its proposal, FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items and DFARs 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, which are available electronically at: http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/reps&certs.htm

<DESC>17.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ) number 042898.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 611430.  The Business Size Standard for this solicitation is $5 million.   The term of this contract shall be for one year from date of award.  The Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has a requirement for a firm fixed-price contract for one year with four (4), one-year options for the acquisition of the following services:  Accredited university post-masters program in education, adult learning or human resource development, interdisciplinary studies and other academic disciplines which provide and support an array of relevant course offerings which relate to the mission, responsibilities, requirements and needs of the FBI;  Academic programs which are flexible enough to provide a strong formal education structure, but can accommodate an orientation toward the adult learner;  Course offerings and consultative services within or between university departments than can lead to a terminal degree, should the individual student participant so desire;  A measurable percentage of relevant course work which is taught either at the beginning or end (evenings) of the workday.  Additionally, it would be desirable for respondents to offer a maximum degree of flexibility in course scheduling.  Distance learning methods can be used to supplement instruction within a course.  University submitting a proposal must have a permanent teaching facilities located within fifty miles of Washington, D.C., or be willing to conduct classes at the FBI Academy, and possibly establish a presence at the FBI Academy. The FBI will provide all necessary classroom facilities and Audio Visual (AV) equipment for classes conducted at the FBI Academy.  Partnerships or consortium arrangements among universities are strongly encouraged. Appointment of appropriately credentialed FBI personnel as Adjunct faculty, for the purpose of course planning and execution, research and development or participation in other university programs.  Where appropriate, courses could be developed and conducted jointly to take advantage of both university and FBI expertise and facilities.  All students should be charged the same rate of tuition regardless of the state or district where they reside.  Collaboration by university and FBI personnel to develop "short" (compressed time) courses, specialized training and conferences which address emerging or as yet un-addressed requirements and needs of the national and international law enforcement training and education community. Active participation by university faculty and post-graduate students in collaborative basic and applied research with the FBI. When research is assigned or agreed to by a faculty member and/or post-graduate student, FBI staff will participate actively in that program for its duration, to include membership on the student research committee. The collaboration could include regular on-site visits (both university and FBI Academy) to work on research projects.  It should be the intention of both parties to encourage joint presentation/publication of research or other work in relevant, peer-reviewed journals or forums.  Willingness of the universities to meet all of the above to engineer and maintain strategic partnerships to achieve a multi-layered program. In your response to this Request for Proposals, the offeror shall also submit to the FBI the following information:  Course descriptions, titles and numbers contained in the university/college catalog;  Requirements for the relevant degree program, including prerequisite and graduation requirements; and, Policy regarding acceptance of course credits from other universities. The guaranteed minimum under this contract will be one class of eight students.  Description and program specifics:  The FBI seeks a sequence of courses and milestones that can be identified as a block of courses, to include preliminary exams and timetable for coordinating published research.  Standard admissions process - proposal must include admission process requirements.  The FBI anticipates the course work will center on these four areas:  Foundations - A minimum of three courses in foundations, including topics such as Informal Learning in the Workplace, The Programming Process in Adult Learning, History of Adult Education, Individual and Organizational Development, Philosophical Foundations of Human Resource Development, and Adult Learning.  FBI students participating in the post-graduate development program already have Informal Learning in the Workplace and The Adult Learner (syllabi for these two courses are available upon request).  These additional courses build on the instruction already provided in the area of adult learning.  Having a professional competence in the area of adult learning is critical both to the mission of the FBI and to the design and delivery of curriculum consistent with the latest advances in the educational community.  Generally, the area of foundations addresses the broader historical, philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of adult education and human resource development.  Practice - A minimum of three courses in practice, including topics such as Consulting With Human Systems, Small Groups in Adult Learning, Facilitating Adult Learning, and Instructional Systems Design.    FBI students participating in the post-graduate development program already have Instructional Systems Design (syllabus for this course is available upon request).  These two additional courses reinforce the provided instruction and further develop the professional instructor competence in small group learning in adults and in human systems.  Generally, the area of practice addresses applications of models and theoretical perspectives of engagement of individuals and other human systems.  Research - A minimum of fifteen (15) hours of statistics and research methods courses are required.  These courses address topics including but not limited to:  qualitative methods and quantitative methods (advanced statistics/regression and program evaluation research methods).    FBI students participating in the post-graduate development program already have one course in Educational Research (syllabus for this course is available upon request).  These research and statistics courses are extremely important to develop a professional research component at the Academy in the short-term, and the University in the long-term.  The research capacity must be developed in a manner that conforms with academic standards, so that results are published, defended and accepted within the academic community.   Generally, the area of research addresses research methods, qualitative and quantitative, including statistical concepts and other tools of inquiry.  In addition to the formal course work in the area of research, the FBI requires its post-graduate students to collaborate on projects demonstrating basic and applied research in addressing critical issues within the FBI.   The research will focus on problems identified and research supported, at least in part, by the FBI.  It is the FBI's intention to encourage an inter-locking research agenda, so that post-graduate students participate joint presentation/publication of research or other work in relevant, peer-reviewed journals or forums.  The FBI estimates this coordinated research effort, which meets the academic equivalent of a published dissertation, to take approximately 30 hours of credit course work, supervised by a faculty committee.  Topics for this coordinated research agenda would be approved by the Assistant Director, Training Division, and by the supervising faculty committee.  Cognate - A minimum of three courses in a "cognate." The FBI desires to assemble some of the course work for this cognate from other courses participating students completed during graduate level course work.  Generally, the area of a cognate represents an area of specialization representing course work relating to a specific academic discipline or specific practice area.  Cognate areas which directly relate to the mission of the FBI include:  distance learning, human development, management science, organizational behavior, curriculum and instruction, knowledge management, and educational administration.  Other cognate areas may be added to this long-term development plan by the FBI, based on the needs of the FBI.  In the event a responding institution has a cognate area that is believed to relate directly to the mission of the FBI and adult learning, respondents are requested to identify the area and the courses which comprise the cognate.  Some of these courses are referred to as "electives," for a total of 12 hours, six of which must be completed in the post-graduate work.  Six of the hours can be carried over from course work completed by the students during graduate level study.  Again, the courses in the electives phase will relate directly to the mission of the FBI and adult learning or organizational development issues.  Professional competence in these areas is essential to fulfill the mission of the FBI and to realize the full potential of the new University.  When matters of research or study contain sensitive information the FBI Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) will be required to approve release of this information.  It is proposed that students will start, and finish, at the same time.  Students will carry either 9 or 6 credits each semester.  The course of study may extend from the base year through options years.  The COTR will work with the selected vendor to identify the courses and their sequence. Participation in this program will be allowed to other Federal Government Agencies authorized by the FBI.  All quotes shall be submitted to the address listed below no later than 3:00 PM, EST, May 8, 2003.  Quotes shall be clearly marked RFQ 042898.  No hand-carried or faxed packages will be considered.
