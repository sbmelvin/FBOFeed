<a href="mailto:Selah Scott">Selah.Scott@va.gov</a>
<DESC>Therapeutic apheresis is used to treat many diseases. The theoretical basis for the therapeutic apheresis is to reduce the patient's load of pathologic substances to levels that will allow improvement. Cells, plasma, or plasma constituents may be removed from the circulation and replaced by normal plasma, crystalloid, colloids such as starch, or albumin. Due to the infrequency of these apheresis procedures the VA Bronx and VA New Jersey Transfusion Medicine service personnel are limited in maintaining certification and expertise to perform them.  The need to have a therapeutic apheresis service available upon the order and immediate direction of the medical center's staff physicians when such physicians determine those services are clinically indicated shall the patient be referred for contract service.  A contract is needed to make therapeutic apheresis services available at the VA Bronx and VA New Jersey, when other options and treatments have failed or not clinically indicated.

The Contractor shall provide the following therapeutic apheresis services when clinical indicated:
	Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (Plasmapheresis)
	Therapeutic Cytapheresis:
		White cell reduction (Leukapheresis)
		Platelet reduction (Plateletcytaphersis)
		Red cell exchange/reduction (Erythrocytapheresis)
		Immunoadsorption - Prosorda Column Therapy

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to manufacture twenty (20) shim safety rods for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 20MW Nuclear Reactor in accordance with the Specifications, Drawings, and Work Instructions that will be provided by the Government.
<p>The National Institutes of Standards and Technology, Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) owns and operates a 20 MW Test Reactor. This reactor is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under the name NBSR (National Bureau of Standards) Reactor. The purpose of the NBSR is to be a steady state source of neutron radiation that is being used to perform a variety of radiation experiments under the research programs of the NCNR.</p>
<p>Among the main safety related components of the NBSR are the Shim Safety Rods (SSR's). The function of the SSR's is to regulate and control the nuclear reaction that is taking place in the core of the reactor. The operation part of an SSR is a sheet of the metal cadmium (Cd: a strong neutron absorber) that is captured between two concentric aluminum cylinders, such that no cadmium is in contact with the outside world. These cylinders do not have a circular cross-section. Their cross-section is better described as "oval" or, better yet, as "race track" . The NBSR employs four (4) SSR's simultaneously.</p>
<p>Just like reactor fuel, SSR's are consumables. As they perform their function as control rods, the cadmium in them slowly "burns up" (which means that, during use, the cadmium isotope that performs the control function is slowly replaced by another cadmium isotope that cannot be used to control the reactor). In practice, this means that the SSR's need to be replaced approximately, every four (4) years. The SSR's are replaced in sets of four (4).</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be 18 months from the date of award.</p>
<p>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business. In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the contractor shall be a small business under the applicable size standard and shall provide either its own product or that of another domestic small business manufacturing or processing concern. See FAR 19.102(f) for additional information.</p>
<p>A fixed-price contract is anticipated.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ under RFP number SB1341-12-RP-0032.</p>
<p>THE RFP IS ANTICIPATED FOR RELEASE TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY ON OR ABOUT MAY 18, 2012 AND WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE VIA THE INTERNET AT THE ABOVE WEB SITE.</p>
<p>POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCESSING THE WEB SITE.</p>
<p>Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT AVAILABLE, TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED, AND NO BIDDERS LIST WILL BE MAINTAINED. Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via email to todd.hill@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE: Intend to Award as Sole Source. Directorate of Emergency Services, Fire and Emergency Services (DES FES), located at 6100 Abbott Road, Ft Belvoir, VA 22060 has a requirement for installing WESTNET alerting systems and components to the existing system which will ensure that all alerting systems function properly.  Note:  This notice is provided for informational purposes only.<br><br>DESCRIPTION:  The Mission & Installation Contracting Command (MICC), on behalf of the DES FES, Ft Belvoir, VA, has a requirement to equip and implement the station's alerting systems in fire stations 463 and 466. Currently DES FES has a partial alerting system that works in cooperation with multi jurisdictional alerting and dispatch systems. The purchase of the remaining components is needed to complete the system and allow the alerting system to become fully operational. Governance of Army Regulation 420-01 Ch 25 requires that FES use an alerting system to dispatch emergency equipment. The WESTNET station alerting system is currently the system that all the local agencies use, and any other system will not interface. By not using WESTNET, the current system would not be functional, thus causing a delay in dispatching emergency equipment, and the possibility of loss of life, and or property. Furthermore the local alerting system administrator [Fairfax County] will not provide interface to any other system other than WESTNET. The MICC intends to award as sole source to WESTNET, 15542 Chemical Lane, Huntington Beach, CA 92649. WESTNET  has been determined the only source deemed capable of fulfilling this requirement, due to the fact that WESTNET is the only one responsible source and no other will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. Vendors may submit a capability statement which shall be reviewed by the Agency.  Any vendor that believes it can provide the stated capability within the established timeframe is invited to submit written notification to the contract specialist below no later than 27Sept12 at 9:00AM EST.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm's ability to provide the stated capability within the established timeframe.  Information can be sent to the Contract Specialist, MICC ATTN: Lisbeth S. Mosgrove, 9410 Jackson Loop, Suite 110, Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5116.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  Responses received will not be evaluated.  However, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, MICC will proceed with the sole source award.<br><br>NAICS: 334290 <br><br><br>W91QV1-12-S-9214 Special Notice<br><br>

<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. QUOTATION PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: To assure the timely and equitable evaluation of quotations, vendors must follow the instructions contained herein. Vendors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors and if applicable, sub-factors. Quotations submitted in response to this Combined Synopsis/Solicitation must address the following evaluation factors ; FACTOR I - Price, FACTOR II - Past Performance</p>
<p>FACTOR I - PRICE <br />1) An offer must be made on all categories for that offer to be eligible for consideration for award. The Government may assess the realism of proposed prices where a vendor's total evaluated price can realistically support the requirement herein.</p>
<p>FACTOR II - PAST PERFORMANCE<br />1) Evaluations will be based on the Vendor's quote in response to the requirement of the Solicitation and the Government assessment of the Vendor's past performance record. All information for Past Performance, will be gathered from the Vendor's quote, and may be verified with the contact information provided in the quote or other means available to the Government. Failure by vendors to submit past performance information or the ability to accurately reference points of contacts may result in an "Unacceptable" past performance rating, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The purpose of this assessment is to determine if a vendors past performance on recent/relevant operations were favorable, and therefore providing the Government a reasonable expectation that the vendor, if selected for award, can successfully perform the requirements of the resultant contract. Based upon the evaluation vendors will be assigned ratings of "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable". Vendors with an "Unacceptable" Past Performance rating will not be considered for award.</p>
<p><br />2. Basis of Award: The award will be made to the vendor whose quotation represents the best value to the government. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive, and represents the best value to the government based on selection of the lowest evaluated price. To be eligible for award, a quotation must be able to make an offer on all CLINs in the Bid Schedule, and provide all information required. If the quotation received does not provide pricing for all items then it will be determined unacceptable, the vendor will be excluded from competition and will not be considered for award.</p>

However, scanned documents are acceptable when they are part of a submission of a payment request made using Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) or another electronic form authorized by the Contracting Officer.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts: Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

A curved chinstrap provides enhanced protection to the front of the neck while reducing neck and chin irritation. Sleeves terminate in double-layer wristlets and feature continuous water wells ending in elasticized gathers that channel liquid to the outside of the moisture barrier, minimizing water infiltration at the wrist (which helps to prevent steam burns).

     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--

       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

In order for DFAS to make payments, they need a contract, invoice, and a receiving report. DFAS looks for a contract in the Electronic Data Access (EDA) system, if an invoice and/or receiving report is received via WAWF. Request for payments must be submitted electronically via the internet through the Wide Area Work Flow - Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) system at https://wawf.eb.mil.<br><br>c. COMBO Document -If the vendor submits a Combo Document (invoice/receiving report), then the invoice goes straight to DFAS and the receiving report is routed to the acceptor via the Business Partner Network (BPN) number annotated on the Contract/Delivery Order (this is Input by the vendor when creating the document). It is imperative that the Point of Contact (POC) shown on the Contract/Delivery Order is registered in WAWF or the vendor will not be able to submit. When the acceptor accesses WAWF and accepts the receiving report, DFAS will process the receiving report against the Invoice to make payment to the vendor. When establishing the contract/delivery order, the Acceptor/Inspector Information needs to include the POC name, mailing address, e-mail. and phone number.<br><br>Questions concerning payment should be directed to the Defense Finance Accounting Services<br>(DFAS) at http://www.dfas.mil/contractorpay/electroniccommerce/wideareaworkflow.html.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

NUWC Division Newport intends to place a purchase order with Sarnoff International (SRI) to support analysis and modifications of the Acadia Video Card.   This piece of hardware and software is based off of a design that SRI has developed over the past 15 years.
  SRI therefore gained significant expertise in the design and performance of this component, and is the only vendor capable of modifying or testing this component. Going to another contractor would incur unacceptable  cost and schedule impacts to the project. This requirement will be solicited in accordance with the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. FAR Part 13 procedures will be used. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
 This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is a synopsis and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not a commitment by the U.S. Navy to procure subject items. Additional information will be provided upon the release of solicitation number N6660412Q3782, which in accordance with FAR 5.203(a) is expected to be on or about 27 Sep 2012. Solicitation is unrestricted.
  For information on this acquisition contact Michael H. Broomfield at 401-832-8469 or e-mail at michael.h.broomfield@navy.mil.  All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps and NECO. It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor FedBizOpps and/or NECO for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation. For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award. Please reference the above solicitation number when responding to this notice.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 08 - 672 - San Juan, PR is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1 Business Office - Outreach. Justification for other than full and open competition TA#: 523-12-3-9182-0070 (QUICKSERIES PUBLISHING)

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  One-time open market firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of 85,000 QuickSeries Reference Guides and 5,000 eGuides. This is a reprint from a custom order that was completed in FY11 under transaction 523-11-3-9182-0002.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

Purchase of 85,000 Quick Series Reference Guides and 5,000 eGuides with the following titles:

1. VISN 1 - Your Personal Guide to VA		
2. Welcome to Your West Haven VA Health 	
3. Welcome to Your VA Boston Health Care 	
4. Welcome to Your Northampton VA Medical 	
5. Welcome to Your White River Junction VA 	
6. Welcome to Your Providence VA Medical 	
7. Welcome to Your Manchester VA Medical 	
8. Welcome to Your Edith Nourse Rogers 		
9. Welcome to Your Togus VA Medical

This is a reorder of a custom order processed in FY 11. Delivery to be made approximately 60 days after award date. (Nov 2012)

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

Quick Series Publishing Inc. is the publisher and sole distributor of the QuickSeries guides. All QuickSeries publications produced by QuickSeries Publishing Inc. are protected under the "1976 Copyright Act. QuickSeries Publishing Inc. is therefore the Sole Supplier and Sole Distributor of the QuickSeries guides. This would make QuickSeries the only one responsible source (FAR 6.302-1).  


All QuickSeries Pocket Guides are copyrighted off-the-shelf products.  Each publication is carefully researched, edited, and presented in such a way as to ensure maximum credibility combined with user friendliness.  Accordingly, QuickSeries is the only firm capable of providing the supplies described in section III above without the Veteran's Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost through custom set-ups that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

No other efforts will be made to solicit potential sources at this time.  Quick Series is the only publishing company used by VHA and other Government agencies to create these Quick Reference Guides. There is no other publishing company that can provide the same quality reference guides for VHA staff.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:   

The guides for VISN 1 are a custom order and therefore would not be found on QuickSeries' GSA Federal Supply Schedule (GS-02F-0276P).  However, QuickSeries Publishing Inc, is offering the Government discounted GSA pricing based on the non-custom guides that are on their schedule.  Pricing under GSA schedules is deemed fair and reasonable. The pricing offered is no different from other reference guides offered by the firm and is at cost similar to other publications of a similar nature.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Market research was conducted. Quick Series Publishing Inc. is the publisher and sole distributor of the QuickSeries guides. All QuickSeries publications produced by QuickSeries Publishing Inc. are protected under the "1976 Copyright Act. QuickSeries Publishing Inc. is therefore the Sole Supplier and Sole Distributor of the QuickSeries guides.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: 

There are no other known vendors of this quality of reference guides that have the same level of expertise as reflected by Quick Series Publishing.  Over the past 17 years, QuickSeries has produced over 300 publications under the QuickSeries trademark for Government agencies.  Their trademark has become a trustworthy reference resource for millions of users.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

     The barriers of cost and experience are high to create the quality and turnaround possessed by QuickSeries 
     publishing. No actions are planned at this time.
