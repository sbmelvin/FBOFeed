The Samuel S. Stratton Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Hereafter "VA"), located at 113 Holland Ave., Albany NY 12208, plans to solicit the market and make competitive award of a Real Property Lease Agreement for a minimum  of 2,400 gross (2,000 ANSI/BOMA Net Usable) square feet of outpatient clinic space located within Catskills in the state of New York.  The space must include at least 10 patient parking spaces, with an additional 7 for VA staff/Government Vehicles preferred.  At least two patient spaces must be marked as handicapped and located directly adjacent to the building entrance.
The geographic limitations detailed above will be strictly enforced and the VA will not accept or consider offers from beyond its boundaries.
The anticipated lease agreement would be for a five-year base term with one five-year option to be exercised by the unilateral action of the VA. 
The VA is only willing to consider one type of responses to fulfill this need.  This type is a standard fit-out ready stand-alone building or suite with active utility connections that can be modified to meet the general needs and floor plan of a VA Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (i.e., a "warm, lit shell").  The VA would be the sole occupant of this space once fit-out appropriately for its use.  It is unclear as to whether the VA will amortize or pay a lump sum for any fit-out/construction. 
A beneficial occupancy date, with the space fully modified and prepared for the VA's use to see patients, is required no later than July 17, 2010.  Evaluation will likely take into account whether the offered space could be made ready for VA use prior to that date.  
Interested parties are required to send an email Sonja.Stroud@va.gov to request a market survey of their available property.  This email must be received no later than May 26, 2010.  The email must include a point of contact name, telephone number, email address, the physical address of the property, the available square footage, asking price (if available), and a general overview of the building's age, condition, prior/current use, and available utilities.
Following May 26, the VA will begin the process of formal market surveys at each offered site.  This market survey will consist of a group of VA stakeholders visiting and evaluating each offered space to make a go/no-go determination of whether the space currently meets or can be made to meet the VA's needs.  These market surveys are anticipated to occur during standard business hours in the month of June, and will require the building owner or a designee pre-approved by the VA to be present.  Market surveys are typically 30 minutes to 90 minutes in length.
Following market surveys, the VA will release a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) to owners of spaces which were rated as a "go" during the market survey.  This SFO will specify a time period in which offerors must prepare a full, signed lease offer and submit the offer to the VA for final evaluation.  The VA may conduct discussions (negotiations) as necessary with offerors to reach a final, best-value decision regarding the ultimate award of a lease.  
All correspondence regarding this synopsis, the resulting solicitation, and the ultimate award of this lease must be conducted exclusively with the Contracting Officer and/or a designee thereof.  The approved designees for this procurement is Ms. Sonja Stroud, Contract Specialist, (518) 626-6139.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Princeton Separations, P.O. Box 300 Adelphia, NJ 07710 to establish a firm fixed-price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract with a base year and four (4) 1-year option periods under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1. These supplies include Centri-Sep Spin Columns, Centri-Sep 8 Well Strips, Centri-Sep 96 Well Plates with PCR Collection Plates, and Centri-Sep 96 Well Plates. <br /><br />The FBI conducts mitochondrial (mtDNA) analysis on forensic evidence. Analysis requires amplification of initially small amounts of mtDNA into larger amounts for sequence detection. The amplified product must be purified before being sequenced on a ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzers. The sample is filtered through a gel column which retains the unwanted ingredients that would inhibit further analysis while allowing the mtDNA to pass through ready for final analysis. The FBI requires a product to prepare post-cycle sequencing products for sequencing through capillary electrophoresis with minimal manipulation, time and risk of sample contamination. The FBI uses two products for this process. These two products are the Centri-Sep Spin Columns and the Centri-Sep 8 Well Strips. Princeton Separations is the only company that can provide both the Centri-Sep Spin Columns and Centri-Sep 8 Well Strips that meet the requirements listed below. <br /><br />Technical Requirements:<br /><br />1. Removal of excess DyeDeoxy or BigDye terminators<br />2. Removal of buffer salts and low-molecular-weight impurities<br />3. Removal of primers from cycle sequencing reactions<br />4. Purify samples between 10-40 &micro;l<br />5. Purify samples between 70-1600 bases<br />6. mtDNA sequence must be obtainable from final product on ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer<br />7. Must be compatible with fluorescent sequencing chemistry<br />8. Minimize preparation time by being ready to use<br />9. Minimize manipulation time by strip setup being 8, 16 or 32<br />10. Minimize sample contamination by not requiring the addition of reagents<br />11. Require the use of in-house, validated instrumentation, which includes thermal cyclers, Speed-Vac centrifugal concentrators, Fisher Vortex Genie 2, and ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer<br />12. Provide minimal exposure to hazardous chemicals<br />13. Have long shelf life at room temperature<br />14. Do not come in 96 well formats - A typical case has 16 or 32 samples to be purified, using a 96-well format would waste over half the plate and would not be cost effective.<br /><br />Based on extensive market research conducted by the FBI Princeton Separations is the only company that can provide the requested DNA sequencing materials. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties are advised that no solicitation document is available for this requirement and may identify their interest and capacity by submitting a capabilities statement by May 21, 2010 at 2:00PM. The capability statement must reference Solicitation Number 10-Q-LDQ003104-3463. The capability statement should be delivered to the FBI&nbsp;Laboratory, 2501 Investigation Parkway, Room, 1252, Quantico, VA 22135, Attn: Lynda M. Theisen, Contracting Officer, by email to <a href="mailto:Lynda.Theisen@ic.fbi.gov">Lynda.Theisen@ic.fbi.gov</a> or by fax at 703-632-8480.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.Listed End Product 	Listed Countries of Origin ___________________

OWH now seeks to build upon the understanding gained through the literature review and evaluation and gain insight as to what health issues its target audiences are facing, and where they are going to find answers.
