The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. 
The following document describes the procurement for Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) services  for the proposed renovation and conversion of Federal Office Building 8, which is primarily a laboratory, located at 200 C Street, SW, Washington, DC, into an office building.   The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and various options for Construction Phase Services, which are described below. The Government intends to award a fixed-price contract with a financial incentive.  
The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. Stage 1 of the process will be a  Request for Qualifications, under which the Government will evaluate experience and past performance and advise offerors of their competitive viability. Thereafter, the Government will issue Stage 2, Request for Proposals, which will solicit price proposals, and additional technical evaluation factors.  Under this solicitation, all evaluation  factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs).  
Project Summary. The building is approximately 46,280 gross square meters (557,700 gross square feet).  The project includes demolition, base building construction, and tenant fit-out.  During construction, the contractor must he  operate and maintain the chilled water plant, which feeds an adjacent building.  The building tenants have not been identified. The estimated range for construction cost, including tenant fit out,  is $95,000,000 to $115,000,000. Occupancy is anticipated by May 2007.  The renovation will be designed in metric units.
Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor.   The General Services Administration (GSA) defines a CMc as a firm that  contracts directly with a building owner, here, GSA, to provide pre-construction services as well as general construction and construction management services. .  The CMc will be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with GSA, GSA's selected A-E firm, and other GSA consultants.
Services to be Provided. The CMc will provide professional, technical, administrative and clerical personnel, as needed, to perform all required services to renovate the building, including, but not limited to, those described in this presolicitation notice.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project.  The CMc will be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines.  
Pre-construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, review and evaluation of the concept, design development and construction document submissions for constructibility, value engineering suggestions, identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documentation, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, cost estimates, and development of subcontractor and supplier interest.
Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, renovation and conversion of the building in accordance with the specifications, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, maintaining of construction records including daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, "commissioning" and turnover to designated facility management staff, and other required supplemental services as requested by GSA.

During contract performance, the CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, means to achieve the best value in performance, necessary actions, schedule control, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  Most importantly, the CMc shall have complete responsibility for renovation and conversion of the facility.
Proposal Submission Requirements. Initial proposals will be evaluated using the Advisory Multi-step Process (FAR 15.202).  Firms should provide information responsive to the evaluation criteria in the RFQ, which will be published on or about August 12, 2003.  The Government will evaluate the submissions to identify and advise the firms about their potential to be viable competitors.  The Government will evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in that notice, and shall advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The Government will advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. The Government will inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions concerning their viability, they may participate in the next step of the acquisition.  Firms that do not submit written responses to the RFQ will not be eligible to compete in subsequent steps of this procurement.
During the RFP stage, the offeror must demonstrate that it is licensed as a Construction Contractor in the District of Columbia; and the offeror must provide a statement from its bonding corporate surety that appears on the list contained in the Department of Treasury Circular 570 "companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties on federal bonds and acceptable reinsuring companies", as certifying their bonding capacity for a project with an estimated range for construction cost of $95,000,000 - $115,000,000. Other bonding options are available in accordance with FAR 28.204 and may be provided as an alternative to evidence of corporate bonding capacity.

Pre-Construction Services are anticipated to be awarded the summer of 2005.  Options for Construction Phase Services will be exercised if the Government chooses, and if the CMc contractor’s performance is satisfactory.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Panama City, Florida, intends to award a sole-source contract to Magneto-Inductive Systems Limited (MISL)  USA ,  330 North D Street, Suite 502, San Bernadino, CA 92401 for  continued technology development and risk reduction for the design, prototype and Advanced Development Test Samples of the Magneto Inductive Signaling Device System (MISDS). The MISDS uses a magneto inductive wireless remote command signaling system, including magneto-inductive transmitters and receivers, to control remote signaling of ordnance through all types of medium including salt water, earth, metal structures, etc.   This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Only Magneto Inductive Systems LTD has the in-depth knowledge of magneto inductive command communication and signaling devices to successfully accomplish this requirement.  MISL is the developer and manufacturer of the magneto inductive technol! ogy necessary to implement this program and owns specific intellectual property.  There are no other known sources. The purpose of this requirement is to conduct a 24-month  technology development and risk reduction phase for designing and prototyping MISDS Transmitters and Receivers and producing Advanced Development Test Samples with an option to conduct a 24-month Systems Development and Demonstration  (SD&D)  Phase for developing MISD Systems and producing Engineering Development  Models for test.   The option will be exercised after a successful Milestone B approval by the Milestone Decision Authority (Program Executive Officer for Littoral and Mine Warfare). Any sources who believe they possess the ability to design, develop and prototype a magneto-inductive wireless remote command signaling system must provide within 15 days of publication of this notice: (1) a description of your firm, (2) past experience designing, testing and producing magneto inductive wireless re! mote command signaling devices, (3) complete listing of any US Government contracts including contract number, amount, description of the project, sponsors name and telephone number, and, (4) any other pertinent information that should be considered to Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Attn:  Code XPS1/Mark Ross, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL. 32407-7001.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to award a sole source  contract  to Northrop Grumman Corporation, Airborne Ground Surveillance and Battle Management Systems Integrated Systems Division, Melbourne, FL for the engineering design support to improve the Airborne Laser Mine Dectection System (ALMDS).   The ALMDS is a lidar Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) high area coverage system that detects, classifies, and localizes floating and near-surface moored sea mines.  The system represents a capability that does not exist in the current Mine Countermeasures (MCM) inventory. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Northrop Grumman Corporation is and has been the sole developer of the AN/AES-1 ALMDS system since the competitive award of the SD&D phase contract. There have been no other contractual actions related to the SD&D phase awarded since this contract. Given the complexity of the system and the ! level of system knowledge required to work through the SD&D it is reasonable to assert that Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully produce the systems.  There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida,(NSWC-PC) intends to award a sole source contract to the Equinox Corporation of  New York City, NY 10019 for continued research and development (R&D) to enhance, demonstrate, and evaluate the capabilities of a visible and thermal infrared image fusion system for persistent maritime surveillance to improve Naval Special Warfare (NSW) situuational awareness. This is a follow-on effort to contract N61331-04-P-1509 which was awarded under Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) NSWC-PC 03-01 for Expeditionary Warfare and Coastal Operations. The Contractor will develop additional improved algorithms and sensors as well as support demonstrations during the contract. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The image fusion system to be developed will be based on several unique and proprietary sensors, software, image/video processing boards, and methodologies developed by the Equinox Corporation. Currently there is no adequate description of these items that would allow a competitor to adequately perform this effort. Only the Equinox Corporation as the incumbent on contract N61331-04-P-1509 has the in-depth knowledge of the sensor and algorithm design to successfully accomplish this requirement. Although NSWC-PC will obtain a final design package of the image fusion system at the completion of this effort currently there is no adequate description of the vehicle design that would allow a competitor to adequately perform this effort. This is a follow-on effort for the continued development of a highly specialized system within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government expended to date under contract that could not feasibly be recovered through competition.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is soliciting proposals to establish a data coordinating center (DCC) to develop and maintain a registry of patients with Marfan Syndrome and other genetically triggered thoracic aortic aneurysms and cardiovascular complications.   The DCC will recruit five (5) regional clinical centers (RCCs) which will collect and transmit to the DCC data, blood and tissue specimens on patients referred for treatment due to Marfan-related or other genetically triggered cardiovascular complications.  The DCC will collect and analyze clinical and laboratory data from RCCs on patients receiving treatment for aortic dilatation, aortic insufficiency, heart failure, or aortic valve repair.  The registry will provide data about the RCCs  and patient-care providers, treatment and patient characteristics, and outcomes in the hospital and in follow-up to researchers both inside and outside the registry who are interested in advancing the fundamental understanding of genetic aortic aneurysms or management of connective tissue disorder afflicted patients.  An important capacity of the registry will be to collect family pedigrees and develop screening protocols for extended families.  It is estimated that 300 connective tissue disorder patients receive valvular surgery each year and that many more patients are being followed for aortic root disease and heart failure.  The expected capacity of the registry for collection of new patient data and specimens is 1,000/year for a period of 4 years.  Specifically, the DCC will: a) develop study protocols to collect data, blood and tissue samples, a manual of operations and study forms and informed consent documents in collaboration with a steering committee consisting of a study chair, DCC Principal Investigator, RCC representatives and the NHLBI, b) collect, format and store data, c) provide statistical analysis of the data and develop necessary software for this analysis, d) establish methods and procedures for tissue collection and storage, and e) facilitate interaction among the RCCs and provide administrative and logistical support for publication and dissemination of findings.   The Government anticipates that one (1) contract will be awarded on a cost reimbursement, incrementally funded basis, for a period of five (5) years.   This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710 with a business size standard of 500 employees.  The solicitation is scheduled for electronic release approximately November 25, 2004.  The RFP will be available at the FedBizOpps Website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov and at the NHLBI Website: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp.  IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS, IF ANY.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTE: Our customers are concerned with maintaining visibility and accuracy of shipped assets.   We are proposing a requirement to require all incoming and  outgoing material to be shipped to a centralized location in order to confirm  receipt + verification of correct asset, accuracy of shipping documents and to  perform a final inspection before shipment.  Since cost is also a priority for  our customers, we don+t want this to result in a large price increase.  We  would like your comments concerning the best commercial practices for this  requirement.  Is there a better way to ensure asset in-transit visibility?   Please provide your comments by 3 December 2004. NOTE: All Prospective Offerors:  Please review all updated attached files  below and provide your comments and questions by 3 December 2004.  It is  important that you provide your comments and questions because they will be  used in developing the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  There are two areas  of particular interest we would like to hear from industry.  First, is how to  handle Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) after contract completion.  Secondly,  some of the foreign PROS users would like the ability to return material  purchased through the PROS program, for any reason, within 90 days of  receipt.  This does not include requirements submitted for investigation under  the Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process.  Foreign customer SDRs will be  processed through the standard SDR process.   SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III)  ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought Parts and Repair  Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and  operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently  active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some  customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives  more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material  (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is  not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for  supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However,  the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD  approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of  the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized)  sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award  fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy  Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised  to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of  contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

Submit the softcopy in Microsoft Word 2000 compatible format on a standard IBM compatible 3.5' high-density diskette or CD. On page 1 identify the intended offeror, a list of key personnel and points of contact on your company's letterhead. The information should include e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and intended roles of each person listed. At a minimum, please include the contracting and technical points of contact. On pages 2-4 include information on the following evaluation categories:

(1) experience and/or capabilities for recruiting, training and retaining highly qualified workforce with technical and military operational experience vital to missile defense test and analysis; (2) experience and/or capabilities to manage, operate and maintain large computers and communication networking systems; (3) experience and/or capabilities working with the United States space or missile defense community; (4) experience and/or capabilities in modeling and simulation, test and evaluation, and analysis; and (5) experience in managing large, complex integrated service contracts. 

Each of the preceding experience and/or capability will be evaluated and rated as either likely viable or likely unviable based on the following criteria: (1) Likely Viable - The potential offeror's submitted information generally meets most of the requirements of the evaluation categories for the SOC.   The information submitted directly addresses the above criteria, but may contain certain elements of risk. (2) Likely Unviable - The potential offeror's submitted information that does not generally meet most of the requirements of the evaluation categories for the SOC.    The government will advise potential offerors whether or not they appear to be viable competitors.  Viable competitors will be invited to compete on the FRFP, which will include detailed requirements to submit past performance information, formal pricing information, and a detailed technical proposal. Firms who are advised that they do not appear to be viable competitors will not be invited to submit proposals; however, they will not be precluded from competing on the FRFP.  One-on one discussions will be held with competitors submitting a SOC.  In order to encourage teaming arrangements, the government intends to publish the list of viable prime contractors along with the contracting and technical points of contact and their respective e-mail addresses. Nothing submitted with the SOC or in response to this synopsis will be used for evaluation purposes once the FRFP is released. This acquisition will use full and open competition. 

This invitation to participate in the on-site Industry/Orientation Day and Advisory Multi-Step process does not constitute a request for proposal. The information presented herein will not obligate the government in any manner.  The government will not reimburse the attendees for any costs associated with participation at the Industry/Orientation Day or SOC preparation and delivery. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request For proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<CONTACT>Joan  A. Jojola, 505-678-5711
<DESC>Following are questions and answers to W9124Q-AATEA, dated 3 November 2004. All other information remains the same. 1.  Question:  Do the performance qualifications apply to the prime contractor or to the team that the prime may assemble? 1.  Answer:  Following the criteria it is up to the Offeror how he submits his proposal. 2.  Question:  Regarding the following PreSol. I wanted to know where the exact place of performance requirements were. Will it require all FTE's to be onsite at White Sands or can it be a blend of offsite and onsite? 2.  Answer: Onsite at TRADOC sites as required and limited offsite support as required. 3.  Question: Is Advanced Systems Technology the incumbent contractor? 3.  Answer: This inquiry must be submitted to the Contracting Office in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.   4.  Question:  Regarding the subject solicitation can you provide clarification concerning the criteria:  'd.  Interpretation of data through multi-media and production products.' 4.  Answer: Use multimedia and other presentation documentation tools to display, present, and document analysis results. 5.  Question:  The subject pre-solicitation notice states that the 'contractor will provide support to all areas of the TRAC Mission Essential Task List (METL).' After a quick search of the Internet and Army Knowledge On-line, I am unable to locate the spe cified TRAC METL. Do you intend to make this METL available as part of a bidder's reference/resource repository, or should I strive otherwise to obtain a copy?  5.  Answer:  See Modification 2 of the Synopsis.   6.  Question: Is there an incumbent contractor, and if so, who is it, what is the contract number, value and expiration date?  6.  Answer: See Answer to Question 3.   7.  Question: I am currently researching solicitation number W9124Q-AATEA for the Research, Engineering And Analysis Activities. I have a few questions that I hope you can help me with. My questions are:          1. Is this procurement considered a new requirement?  	2. If this procurement is not considered a new requirement?  	   a. Who is the incumbent?  	   b. What is the contract number?   7.  Answer:  See Answer to Question 3. 8.  Question:  a.  How is this work being performed today?  Government personnel?  One or more contractors?   b.  If contractors, please provide the following contract data: Contract number, Contractor corp name, Contractor POC and phone/email, Period of Perf, Dollar value: 8.  Answer:  See Answer to Question 3. 9.  The requirement for 5 years experience in three out of four of the listed 'areas' 1. a-d, limits newly-formed companies -like ours - that are otherwise qualified.  a. Questions:  Please consider whether the government's needs can be met with the 2-year experience applied to all the 'areas'. 9a.  Answer:  In the best interest of the Government, the capabilities for this requirement must remain as stated.   b. Question:  For companies with less than five years of existence, might the experience of the owner/officers and/or Program Manager count to meet the five-year requirement? Please amend the announcement as appropriate. 9b.  Answer:  The required experiences as stated in the synopsis. 10.  Question:  Given the recent modifications to the original sources sought synopsis, will there be any adjustment to the phase one response date?    10.  Answer:  Response date remains the same.   11.  Question:  Also, we are an SB under 500 but do not meet the 23M size standard. Is there any possibility of adjusting the size standard if sufficient qualified, competition has not been found?  11.  Answer:  The size standard is in accordance with the Small Business Administration NAICS.    12.  Question:  Site Visit. Is it the Government's intent to provide a site visit for potential bidders? If so, when will this occur?  12.  Answer:  A site visit wil l be offered to those offerors who are rated as viable as a result of the Phase 1 responses.  There is no date for the site visit at this time.     13.  Question: Does the government intend to release a Statement of Work (SOW, draft or otherwise) prior to the 30 November 2004 deadline for Step I (Phase I) submissions that delineates the types and levels of support required in support of 'The contracto r will provide support to all areas of the TRAC Mission Essential Task List (METL)'; and, to serve as a guide for tailoring the requested Experience to the types and levels of support required for this effort? 13.  Answer:  The synopsis is considered Phase 1 of a multiple step selection and award process.  In order to participate in this competition you must submit your responses to the four criteria listed in the synopsis.  The most viable candidates will recei ve the solicitation which will require the submission of price, past performance, oral technical and, or, management proposals.     14.  Modification 02 changed the level of required facility security clearance from SECRET to TOP SECRET as well as added the requirement for TOP SECRET clearances for designated positions, including the Program Manager. a.  Question:  How many TOP SECRET clearances are required and for which positions?  14a.  Answer:  At a minimum, the project manager is required to have a Top Secret clearance; others are required by task assignment.   b.  Question:  How many SECRET clearances will be required? 14b.  Answer:  All contractors in the TRAC-WSMR facility require a SECRET clearance c.  Questions:  What is the mix for the current incumbent staff relative to TOP SECRET and SECRET clearances?  Are there any proposed staff who will not require a clearance?  14c.  Answer:  No.   d.  Questions:  Is the ability to be able to obtain and/or reactivate a TOP SECRET clearance sufficient?  14d.  Answer:  Yes, eligibility for the Interim suffices, but clearances are required as stated in amendment 2 to the synopsis. e.  Question:  Are there any other special access considerations?   14e.  Answer: None, at this time. f.  Question:  What prompted the change in clearance levels?  14f.  Answer: An error.   g.  Question:  Are we now to identify the Program Manager candidate who is required to have and maintain a TOP SECRET clearance?    14g.  Answer:  Yes  h.  Question:  Are we now to identify other proposed personnel with TOP SECRET clearances that may be required for the designated positions?  14h.  Answer:  The SECRET AND TOP SECRET requirements are as stated in the Synopsis and Amendment 2 to the synopsis. i.  Question:  Are we now to identify other proposed personnel with a minimum SECRET clearance level to support the final requirement, 'and a minimum of SECRET clearance on your employees'?  14i.  Answer:  See 14h above. 15.  Question:  What projects and/or programs has TRAC supported, is currently supporting and/or anticipated to support (again to tailor the levels of experience to the levels and types of technical program support provided)? 15.  Answer:  Information was provided in the synopsis and amendments to the synopsis. 16.  Question:  Do the page limitations include Cover/Title page, Table of Contents, an Introduction, and/or Summary? 16.  Answer:  Page limitation is as stated in the synopsis. 17.  Question:  Relative to the original announcement and the statement, 'To accomplish these tasks, TRAC develops, maintains, configuration manages and operates selected war fighting models.', what are these selected war fighting models? 17.  Answer:  VIC, Janus, Castforem, and COMBAT XXI 18.  Question:  What specifically is meant by 'multi-media and production projects'? 18.  Answer:  See answer to question 4.   19.  Question:  What software and/or hardware tools and media are being referred to?  19.  Answer:   The software and/or harware will be stand alone. 20 .  Question:  Your requirement for 'at least 5 years experience in 75% of the areas' appears to be very restrictive and may preclude relatively new small businesses who may have established expertise and experience in these areas from participating.  What criteria was used to establish this requirement? 20.  Answer:  The transition process and operation of the contract require a fully qualified and experienced staff. 21.  Question:  Who is the Source Selection Authority for this effort?   21.  Answer:  This information is not available.

SUMMARY of REQUIREMENT
 for
AIR UNIVERSITY’S SOFTWARE SUPPORT SERVICES


I.  OBJECTIVE 

The objective of this summary is to describe the requirements of Air University (AU) at Maxwell AFB, AL for software services in support of AU’s education mission. This summary captures in general terms the software development support activities for all existing, planned, and future AU enterprise-level automated information systems (AIS). Typical software technical services and engineering support include capturing user and stakeholder requirements; coordinating with the appropriate AU agency personnel and performing tasks associated with enterprise architecture; capital investment planning; program/project management, identifying functional security, performance requirements, developing logical and physical database models; performing coding, testing, quality assurance, backup/recovery, design, program and system documentation, software maintenance, implementation; and maintaining interoperability between existing and future hardware and software applications. Software applications include, but are not limited to client-server applications, web applications, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) integration, Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) integration, and custom applications development.  

The systems provide support to all areas of the AU education mission including: 1) student enrollment and student registration records management; 2) student records administration; 3) course and class planning and scheduling; 4) admissions; 5) production/quota management; 6) curriculum/course management; 7) student and faculty evaluations to include academic testing; 8) faculty and staff administration; 9) institutional effectiveness/research management; 10) publications; 11) equipment resources; 12) financial management; and 13) general office automation.

Software services are required to support the functions of the Headquarters AU Directorates, i.e., Central Registrar including Institutional Effectiveness and Course Planning and Programming.  The primary AIS supporting the Central Registrar is a J2EE Java JSP based system on an Oracle 9i database. Support is also provided to several AISs in the various AU colleges/schools.  These include, but are not limited to the following:
  
Air War College (AWC) educates senior level officers (256 in-resident and 3,500 distant learners) to lead at the strategic level in the development and employment of air and space forces in support of National Security. The primary AIS supporting the AWC resident program is a web based Microsoft.net system on a MS SQL Server 2000 database.
  
Air Command and Staff College (ACSC) is the Air Force’s intermediate professional military education school that prepares field grade officers (over 600 resident and 9,000 distance learners and seminar students) of all services, international officers, and U.S. civilians to assume positions of higher responsibility within the military and other government agencies. Today ACSC provides software services using a Cold Fusion application. The current strategic plan calls for taking the AWC Microsoft.net application and port it to the ACSC academic environment.
  
Squadron Officer College (SOC) consists of the Air and Space Basic Course for 2nd Lieutenants and Squadron Officers School for Captains combined under one college. Together these two schools prepare young officers for challenges of the future and develop tomorrow’s expeditionary force leadership. The AIS supporting the SOC resident course program is a web based Java JSP based system using an Oracle 9i database.
  
Ira C. Eaker College for Professional Development (CPD) provides professional continuing education and technical training to Air Force, International, and other DoD personnel. CPD has eight component schools that offer 83 resident and distance learning courses to over 9,000 students annually. A version of the SOC application was recently modified for CPD and is in final stages of being moved in its Comptroller course. Strategic plans call for taking this same application into the remaining seven schools to accommodate the uniqueness of each school’s requirements.   

Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) offers and awards job-related associate in applied science degrees that support the career transition of Air Force enlisted members. Over 161,000 students completed about 1.7 million semester hours of course credit through CCAF affiliated schools in 2001-2002. In the October 2004 graduating class, over 7,000 associate in applied science degrees were awarded. The primary AIS supporting the CCAF program is a J2EE Java JSP based system on an Oracle 9i database. This system is in its last major increment for development and should declare Full Operational Capability this calendar year (CY).
  
College for Enlisted Professional Military Education (CEPME) provides PME curriculum for all enlisted education in the Air Force. CEPME schools support includes the Senior Non-Commission Officer Academy at Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex, 15 Non-Commission Officer Academies and 68 Airman Leadership Schools (ALS) throughout the world.  The AIS supporting the CEPME resident course programs is a web based Java JSP system using an Oracle database. This software system was modified from the original system fielded to support the SOC.  Implementation of the ALSs should be completed this CY and remaining enhancements in the subsequent year.  

Air Force Institute for Advanced Distributed Learning (AFIADL) provides distance learning methodologies and technologies to support instructionally sound learning throughout the service.  This is accomplished through the Extension Course Program, the Air Technology Network and ADL consulting services. The primary AIS supporting the AFIADL course program is a COBOL, C programs and Oracle Forms based system with some ASP web components. While declared fully operational, maintenance and enhancements are ongoing (e.g. recent addition of electronic testing). 
Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS) provide leadership and policy direction for the Air Force’s officer recruiting, training and commissioning programs at Officer Training School and at Air Force ROTC detachments at 144 universities. About 80 percent of the new officers who enter the Air Force each year come through one of these programs. AFOATS also directs the Air Force’s high school citizenship training program – Air Force Junior ROTC at more than 744 Air Force ROTC units on high school campuses around the world. Currently, the AFOATS software application is maintained within its organization and is provided here for information only. 


2.   AIR UNIVERSITY MISSION AND VISION
2.1 Mission.  Air University provides the full spectrum of Air Force education, from pre-commissioning to the highest levels of professional military education (PME), including degree granting and professional continuing education (PCE) for officers, enlisted, and civilian personnel throughout their careers. The university’s PME programs educate airmen on the capabilities of air and space power and its role in national security. These programs focus on the knowledge and abilities needed to develop, employ, command, and support air and space power at the highest levels. Specialized PCE programs provide scientific, technological, managerial, and other professional expertise to meet the needs of the Air Force. As the intellectual center for the Air Force, Air University provides consultation to senior service leaders and conducts research in air and space power, education, leadership, and management. The university also provides citizenship programs and contributes to the development and testing of Air Force doctrine, concepts, and strategy.

S. Army CECOM DUE 120304 POC Mr. Tom Newman, (732) 427-5034 DESC: ULCANS is managed by Product Manager(PM) Force Sustainment Systems(FSS) and is supported by U.S. Army CECOM Ft. Monmouth. The purpose of this market research is to solicit information from industry to determine the current capability to support the p roduction of ULCANS camouflage systems. ULCANS Systems are currently being produced on an existing contract IAW Performance Specification PRF 53134 Rev D which has a Distribution Statement D: Distribution authorized to DoD and U.S. DoD contractors only; Critical Sensitive Information; Other requests for this document shall be referred to  the U.S. Army CECOM Logistics Readiness Center, Ft. Monmouth, NJ.  The Army awarded a 5-year IDIQ contract to SAAB Barracuda in Dec 03.  Due to the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), demands for ULCANS have significantly out-paced the anticipated requiremen ts.  At the current demand rates, the Army expects to reach the contract dollar ceiling on the current contract sometime in late FY 05, or early FY 06.  The Army has plans to solicit a new production contract during the government fiscal year of 2005. The Army anticipates that this will be a 5-year IDIQ contract with up to 5 Option Years.  This new contract shall produce four configurations Woodland Radar Scattering, Woodland Radar Transparent, Desert Radar Scattering and Desert Radar Transparent, and will allow for the development of other ULCANS variants such as Snow/Artic, Urban and Aviation.  Production rates of up to 10,000 Systems and 2,000 spare nets per month are anticipated. The Government may award to multiple vendors in order to meet the required production rates.  Each variant shall comply with the standard physical configurations consisting of camouflage screens, repair kit, operator / maintenance manual,storage / transport containers, support system set consisting of 24 ground stakes, 12 screen support poles, 6 shape disrupters and separate storage / transport container. Key Performance Parameters:  ULCANS must provide concealment by multiple sensors, and be interoperable with the current ULCANS Systems produced under the existing contract.  Curr ently hostile forces are using commercial means and their own national capabilities to detect, identify, target, and kill friendly forces via their visual, electro-optic, radar, and infrared signatures.  These variants have been established based on the TR ADOC requirements for multi functional operations during conflicts and are required to meet multiple threats.  When camouflage is erected over one of many military tactical systems it shall not impair the mission of that system being covered.  Outcome: The  results of this survey will serve as the basis for initiating the competitive acquisition and provide the Government program office with a prospective of industries capability to produce the ULCANS systems.  Please indicate if you are interested in prime,  teaming, or sub-contactor opportunities.  The Government intends to host an Industry Day at Ft. Monmouth NJ on 16 Dec 04.  E-mail responses to this survey shall be submitted to Mr. Tom Newman at Thomas.Newman@mail1.monmouth.army.mil. RESPONSES DUE NO LATE R THAN 3 Dec 2004.

a.  Supervisory Control Over Position

This position is supervised by the Director of the USAID Cuba Program, who establishes general responsibilities to meet USAID’s strategic goals, assigns specific monthly and weekly tasks, provides policy guidance, and reviews work in terms of overall accomplishment of desired results.

d.  Nature, Level and Purpose of Personal Contacts

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Question:
We cannot quote on all the gases  on the bid.  Does that automatically disqualify us?

Answer:
Yes, that does disqualify, since all analytes must be mixed in the same gas that is delivered as background.  Without that, the experiment is meaningless.

Question: The specifications call for UHP regulators, etc.  Can these be threaded connections?  Or do they require VCR connections (electronics grade)?

Answer: Threaded or VCR are both fine.

The due date for quotations remains unchanged.

2.1		Kick-Off Meeting with the USTDA Program Office

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) (see G.2) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		Pre-Visit Report

Prior to departure to the host countries, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

 
2.3		USTDA Responsibility

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Economic Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		Contractor’s Host Country Travel 

The Contractor shall travel to various locations within Mauritius to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Economic Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		Contractor Meaningful Discussions

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.

The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA Report Objectives

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s);

2.6.2.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues, as cited in Sections C.3.1 through C.3.15.

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

6 		Project Descriptions and Profile

Mauritius is embarking on a progressive program to transform the public utilities sector, and to encourage private sector development and investment in key power and water projects.  The Mauritius Ministry of Public Utilities (MMPU) has approached USTDA for assistance with its utility regulatory transition for power, water and wastewater.  

The MMPU has been receiving assistance from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) regarding the establishment of an independent regulator for public utilities.  As the IFC assistance ends, the MMPU requests USTDA support for a U.S. advisor (to be selected) to lend capacity support as the regulator is further defined and created. 

The selected DM consultant will travel to Mauritius to meet with appropriate MMPU officials to evaluate their proposal and other possibilities for USTDA funding. If USTDA funding is recommended by the DM consultant, the consultant will assist the MMPU structure this assistance to meet the MMPU's needs.  Since USTDA has no additional information for other similar projects in Mauritius, the definitional mission will require a great deal of on-the-ground scoping in Mauritius.  A separate, but complementary DM would be commissioned for a wastewater regulatory transition technical assistance request from the MMPU.

The MMPU is a progressive ministry attempting to restructure the public utilities sector in Mauritius.  Its primary focus is to build regulatory and technical capacity to form structures that encourage private sector participation in power and water projects.  Mauritius has a one hundred percent utility payment base for power and water (both residential and industrial), which provides the necessary cash flow to make projects bankable.  The MMPU was the USTDA Grantee for the 1999 Fort William Thermal Power Plant feasibility study, a project that is on-hold pending the creation of an independent regulator to oversee private investment.

6 		Project Descriptions and Profile

Mauritius is embarking on a progressive program to transform the water and wastewater sector, and encourage private sector development and investment in key projects.  The definitional mission (DM) will be expected to review and help further develop the technical and capacity building assistance request from the Mauritius Ministry of Public Utilities (MMPU) for its future wastewater project development.  The DM will also explore other water and wastewater projects in Mauritius and make suggestions to USTDA about funding.

The MMPU is a progressive ministry attempting to implement wastewater treatment projects in Mauritius.  The government wants to encourage private sector participation in water projects.  Mauritius has a one hundred percent utility payment base for water (both residential and industrial), which provides the necessary cash flow to make projects bankable.  
 
The MMPU intends to invest $379 million over the next seven years to expand wastewater treatment in Mauritius from twenty percent to fifty percent.  Projects would be developed on both a public and private basis.  The MMPU requests USTDA support to provide its wastewater treatment team with a U.S. advisor to help develop and design future projects.

The selected DM consultant will travel to Mauritius to meet with appropriate MMPU officials to evaluate their proposal and other possibilities for USTDA funding.  Among other possibilities, the consultant should meet with large sugar and textile manufactures to investigate possible future investment in wastewater treatment.  USTDA has no additional information for these other funding possibilities; the definitional mission team would be required to scope the projects on the ground in Mauritius.  A separate, but complementary DM would be commissioned for a utility regulatory transition technical assistance request from the MMPU.

6.		 Project Descriptions and Profile

Water is becoming a scarce commodity, and the situation is expected to worsen in India within the next two decades without the introduction of efficient water resource management technologies and improvement of water treatment infrastructure.  In six of the India’s twenty major river basins, water resources are under stress.  By the year 2025, five more basins will become water scarce and by 2050, only three basins in India will remain water sufficient.  At the same time, the Government of India's "India Water Vision, 2025" report estimates the gross water demand to double in 25 years.  Significant investment will be required to meet this demand.  To meet the water shortage, the states in southern India are looking both at ways to add more treated water to the overall system and to make more efficient use of the available resources.  

For additional water supply, the Tamil Nadu Government recently issued approval for the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) to develop a 100 million liters per day desalination plant project.  CMWSSB has requested technical assistance in support of this project for evaluating technology options, developing project structure, assessing financing options, and soliciting and evaluating bid proposals.  

 In the area of more efficient water use, government and industry in southern India are looking to reduce the overall water requirements of heavy industry by implementing effective industrial wastewater treatment and re-use projects.  At present, a number of heavy industrial plants with high demand for water supply and wastewater treatment systems are looking to upgrade their treatment capacities.

Many Indian communities are facing critical competition in sharing irrigation water with water supply for industrial production.  Of all the water supply, 80% of water is used for irrigation while other users, including domestic and industrial, receive less than 20%.  There is a need to reduce the irrigation water to 60% so that other sectors will have increasing share.  The Tamil Nadu Government has determined that it needs to apply modern irrigation technologies and techniques to enhance the efficiency of its irrigation infrastructure.  This has been given the highest priority by the recently elected national government.

	The Contractor will be expected to identify, evaluate and develop full project recommendations (including terms of reference and budgets) for three projects suitable for USTDA funding.

6. 		 Project Descriptions and Profile

Pakistan’s transport sector is inefficient.  To rectify this problem, the Pakistani Government and the World Bank are considering critical transportation modernization and expansion projects.  The DM consultant would examine four sets of projects recently proposed for USTDA consideration:

1.	Regional rail corridor infrastructure – Pakistan Railways (PR) has requested USTDA assistance with studies on modernization and expansion of rail lines connecting Afghanistan, India and Central Asia with Pakistan and its rail and port infrastructure.  In particular, the DM will consider PR requests for assistance with the following rail lines:
·	Kandhar-Herat-Kushka – to extend the rail network to Afghanistan and Turkmenistan;
·	Gawadar-Nushki -- to handle Central Asian rail freight; and
·	Kasur-Pakpattan-Lodhran -- to improve traffic with India.  
PR’s Director General requested assistance with these projects.

2.	Complementary intermodal facilities to handle rail, truck and maritime cargo along the rail network and at strategic points along Pakistan’s existing logistics infrastructure.

3.	With Pakistan committed to improving its container scanner capabilities and cargo handling procedures, the American Embassy advises that Pakistani transport sector stakeholders could benefit from U.S. technical assistance with transportation security. 

4.	Two years ago, a DM team proposed USTDA consideration of feasibility study support for the $200 million rehabilitation of Karachi’s light rail network.  USTDA postponed support for this recommendation because of unresolved issues related to grantee support.  Given recent statements by the Prime Minister prioritizing this project, this no longer appears to be an issue.

5.	Two years ago, a DM team proposed USTDA consideration of a feasibility study for the Islamabad International Airport.  USTDA postponed support for this recommendation because of unresolved issues related to grantee support.  The project should be reconsidered at this time based upon recent conversations with the American Embassy.
