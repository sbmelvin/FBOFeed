<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control/The National Center for Injury Prevention & Control’s (NCIPS) Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) seeks to lessen the human & economic costs associated with intentional injuries by promoting the widespread adoption of policies & practices that effectively prevent violence, including sexual violence.  Currently, however, most efforts to prevent sexual violence focus either on secondary or tertiary approaches.  In contrast, DVP plans to identify & evaluate approaches that may prevent sexual violence from occurring in the first place (i.e., primary prevention).  To this end, DVP has awarded a three-year contract to Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to identify and lend assistance to approximately four programs designed to prevent first-time male perpetration of sexual violence.  This evaluation assistance will take the form of an “empowerment” evaluation – a highly specialized method for building program capacity as well as gathering useful information for program improvement.  An empowerment evaluation is the use of evaluation concepts, techniques, & findings to foster program improvement & program self-determinination.  It is designed to “help people help themselves” & improve their programs using a form of self-evaluation & reflection.  Program participants conduct their own evaluations & typically act as facilitators; an outside evaluator often serves as a coach or an additional facilitator.  Therefore, the key facets include training, facilitation, & collaboration.  Since an evaluation of this nature falls outside the scope of most contractor experience, DVP seeks an external empowerment evaluation expert to assist RTI staff in three main areas: (1) training sites to manage & analyze evaluation data;(2) providing in-person training, technical assistance, and “coaching” as needed; (3) recommending future improvements.  The purpose of this requirement is to hire an external empowerment evaluator with a demonstrated ability to train program staff, facilitate evaluation activities at each site, & collaborate with CDC, the Contractor, & the program staff at each site.  This external consultant should have expertise in both empowerment evaluation & public health.  The Government’s minimum requirements are (1) At least 10 years of experience conducting highly participatory evaluations; (2) Widely recognized as an expert in the area of applying empowerment evaluation techniques to public health problems; (3) An established record of conducting empowerment evaluations with diverse populations; (4) An established record of conducting evaluation projects with private contractors as well as the Government.  Request for Quotations must be submitted in writing only.  You may FAX your request to the following number (513)533-8283, Attn: Jennifer Bayer.  All responsible businesses may submit a written quotation which, if received timely, will be considered by the Government.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be utilized for this purchase.  The anticipated issuance date of this RFQ is 02/20/04.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of  less than $100,000.00.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to Far 6.302-1 and U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the Johns Hopkins University (JHU), School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD for a four-year cost reimbursement type contract for the creation and maintenance of records in the Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) (JHU Registered Trademark) database.  The OMIM database is a catalog of human genes and genetic disorders.  The purpose of this contract is to ensure the continuance of OMIM as a timely, authoritative, and comprehensive source of information on human phenotypes and genes.  The rate of discovery of new genes and the increase in experimental information pertaining to known genes requires the creation of new entries in the database and the revision of existing ones (currently over 15,000 entries).  Each entry is in a standardized format containing separate fields for its unique identification number (MIM number), descriptive name, locus symbol, descriptive overview, detailed text on the phenotype(clinical features, biochemistry, pathophysiology, clinical management, modes of inheritance) and, where applicable, on the gene (e.g., mapping and cytogenetic observations, gene expression, allelic variants), animal models, historical information, a set of references, clinical synopsis, and editing audit trail.  The database also includes a human gene map with the cytogenetic location of mapped loci arranged by chromosome. The primary source for entries is the peer-reviewed literature, supplemented by scanning genetic-related databases and consultation with recognized gene nomenclature committees and databases.  The creation and revision of entries requires expertise in the field of human and molecular genetics in addition to scientific writing skills.  Scientific judgement is required in determining whether information supports the existence of a distinct gene locus, in weighing the significance of clinical and experimental findings, and in integrating new information with previous entries.

The content of the OMIM database is based on and derived from the printed work, Mendelian Inheritance in Man, which is copyrighted by its publisher, The Johns Hopkins University Press.  The staff at Johns Hopkins under the leadership of Dr. Victor McKusick has been regularly maintaining and updating the data entries since the publication of the first edition in 1966. It is currently in its 12th edition (June, 1998).  Because this compilation of human genes and the disorders and other traits with which they are associated is unique and because the rights to the data are owned by Johns Hopkins University, it has been determined that Johns Hopkins University is the only source capable of fulfilling NLM's requirement.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by The National Library of Medicine.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  See numbered notes 22 and 26.

<CONTACT>James Knudsen, Contracting Officer, 304-285-1361, donald.hafer@netl.doe.gov;Donald Hafer, Contract Specialist, 304-285-1361, donald.hafer@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to issue a competitive solicitation, set aside for Small Business, for Characterization of Coal Utilization By-products from Mercury Control Field Testing.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541380 with a size standard of $10.0 million. The contractor shall provide all supervision, personnel, tools, equipment, and services (excluding those items identified under the government-furnished section of the solicitation document) to perform the contract requirements. The Characterization of Coal Utilization By-products from Mercury Control Field Testing solicitation will analyze the by-products for mercury and other toxic metal releases.  The by-products being tested are generated from mercury control projects awarded in 2003 and 2004 by NETL.  These projects utilize various technologies to remove the mercury from the flue gas at coal-burning electric power generating facilities.  Some of the technologies may deposit additional quantities of Hg onto the by-products.  Many by-products are used in high temperature applications or placed into environments where they will come in contact with water.  Therefore, it is imperative to determine the ultimate fate of mercury on these by-products.  NETL is interested in understanding any potential mercury pathways into the environment.  The goal of this solicitation is to determine the ultimate fate of mercury in the by-products streams in order to guarantee that mercury removal from the flue gas is not counteracted by release of mercury from the by-products.  In doing so, this activity will support NETL?s Innovation For Existing Plants Program goals of maintaining current utilization practices of coal utilization by-products and increasing utilization to 50% by 2010.  Annually, the U.S. generates over 100 million tons of by-products and wishes to avoid large-scale disposal. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be made available for downloading from the IIPS Internet page on March 2, 2004.  The IIPS page is located at http://e-center.doe.gov. At this Internet site you will be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to download the solicitation, join the mailing list for the solicitation, and to submit a proposal.  If you need technical assistance in registering or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or email the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov. Questions relating to the solicitation are required to be submitted electronically through the question submittal option of the IIPS program. All responses to solicitation questions will be released on the IIPS Internet page.  The solicitation will only be made available in IIPS, no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation and related documents will be made available.

52.209-1          QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (FEB 1995)
(IAW FAR 9.206-2)
(a)	Definition:  “Qualification Requirement”, as used in this clause, means a Government requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed before award.

(b)	One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or services covered by this contract.  For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract.  The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list.  Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification.

This is necessary whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question.  If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government’s best interests.
(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product, or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract.  Unless determined to be in the Government’s interest, award of this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit evidence of qualification.

(f) Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a previously qualified product or service was manufactured or performed requires reevaluation of the qualification.  Similarly, any change in location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source requires reevaluation of the qualification.  The reevaluation must be accomplished before the date of award.

<DESC>Supplemental Construction Management/Design Build (CM/DB) Services for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Facilities, Nationwide.  

This procurement will establish an Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) Contract to provide Construction Management or Design-Build and related services for NARA facilities nationwide. This contract is national in scope, supporting all existing and future NARA facilities including Presidential Libraries, Regional Archives, National Records Centers, the National Archives Building, Archives II, etc. 

Services may be required at any time during a project’s development and delivery e.g. planning, design, construction, and operations turnover phases.  Services required may include: planning phase feasibility studies, building assessment reports, design programming, design, interior space planning, cost modeling/analyses, code and owner’s design review, value engineering management, post construction contract services (PCCS), record drawings, constructability design review, construction, construction inspections and tests oversight and post occupancy evaluations. The CM/DB Firm shall be able to provide any level of design and related services. 

The CM/DB firm as used in this solicitation may be a partnership, corporation, association or other entity that will have contractual responsibility to provide the services required by NARA.  The CM/DB firm and all applicable consultants must have personnel either on staff or available via strategic alliances that are licensed by law to practice the professions of architecture and engineering in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  CM/DB services as specified include performing Site Evaluations, Building Condition Reports, CM Design Phase Services (excluding design services), Design/Build Services (including design at any point in the project delivery process), CM Procurement Phase Services, CM Construction Phase Services, Relocation Services, Claims Services, Testing Services,  Miscellaneous Services, Post Occupancy Evaluations, Exhibit Design and Installation, Building Commissioning, and any other services deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer to provide for completely functional facilities.  

Multiple CM/DB Contracts may be awarded. This will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract.  All services will be procured through the issuance of individual Work/Delivery Orders, each defined by a separate scope of work, which will include all elements of work deemed necessary for the project(s).  Throughout the contract period the selected CM/DB will assist NARA in identifying those elements of work that can be accomplished within Congressionally mandated cost limitations or internally established budgets for each project.  The term of the contract shall be for a one (1) Base Year Period, followed by four (4) one-year Option Periods, not to exceed $6,000,000 for each Period, for an aggregate maximum dollar value of $30,000,000. 

The Government currently envisions utilizing a variety of delivery processes such that on some projects the selected firm will act as a CM while on other projects they may act as a DB. The determination as to which delivery process will be utilized on any given project will be at the sole discretion of the Government. Similarly, the decision as to when in the DB delivery process the Government will require a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) will be at the sole discretion of the Government. There is no guarantee that the Government will elect to use a DB approach on any project but firms must have had experience and the capability of providing these services. On projects utilizing a DB approach the selected firm will either provide complete design/build services based on a program of requirements or complete the design and construct the project based on a partial design provided by an Architect/Engineer (A-E) under separate contract to the Government. Accordingly, firms must have design capabilities within their team. On projects utilizing a CM approach the entire design will be produced by an A-E under separate contract to the Government and the CM will be required to provide, in addition to other specified services, professional design reviews for engineering soundness as well as reviews for compliance with existing codes including, but not limited to, UFAS/ADA, NFPA, BOCA, local codes within the jurisdictions that the projects are located, etc.  A-E firms selected as part of a team to provide services as part of this procurement will not be eligible to provide services under a separate nationwide A-E Supplemental IDIQ contract that will be procured in the future to support NARA activities.  


The Evaluation Criteria for selection are as follows: I.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, with Ani Lytics, Inc for the analysis of clinical tests from on-going clinical trials.  This Notice Of Intent is being issued as NOI4049.  The statutory authority for this acquisition is FAR 13.501 and award is anticipated to be made under a Firm Fixed Price purchase order.  The acquisition documents and incorporated provisions and classes are those in effect in the Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-18 dated December 11, 2003.  This acquisition will be processed under the authority of FAR Part 12-- Acquisition of Commercial Items. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541380 and the business size standard is $6 million.  The period of performance of this contract will be from March 1, 2004 through February 28, 2005.  NIAID studies the etiology, pathogenesis and prevention of viral hepatitis and other diseases.  Current research efforts include elucidation of the molecular virology of hepatitis A and the development of a live-attenuated hepatitis A vaccine, delineation of the genetic heterogeneity of hepatitis C virus and characterization of the immune response to it, the diagnosis and prevention of hepatitis E, and the molecular and biological characterization of newly discovered hepatitis C-like viruses of humans and primates. These activities require the inoculation of animals, principally nonhuman primates, with clinical materials and the study of the resulting response of the animals.  This requires testing animals for physiological, immunological and biochemical changes over time.  A critical part of this analysis is testing serum liver enzyme levels, bilirubin levels, other clinical chemistry values and hematologic changes.  The tests to be performed are Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (ICD), Amino Aline Transferase (ALT) and Gamma Glutamine Tranferase.  These tests are non-routine analyses established exclusively at Ani Lytics, Inc. expressly for this study.  Since Ani Lytics has extensively performed this test for NIAID in the past they must continue to provide the testing in order to compare data analyses and maintain consistency in the results. The necessary services are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.  This action is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This is not a request for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NIAID to determine if the party can perform this requirement. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 4:00 PM EST, February 27, 2004. If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to William Rosa, Purchasing Agent, at wrosa@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-480-3695. For delivery through the postal service the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Drive, Suite 2NE70, Room/2NE70C, MSC/4811, Bethesda, Maryland 20817-4812. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NOI-4049.

2.2	TS will provide support by processing shipments on behalf of PNNL in a regulatory compliant, safe and economical manner.  Care will be taken to transport radioactive shipment in a manner to minimize the potential for fines or delays.  TS will create transportation savings for PNNL by working closely with shippers and carriers to negotiate the best rates, and select routes and modes of transport to accomplish these goals.

Services include carrier evaluation and selection; rate negotiation; scheduling and carrier coordination; expediting shipments and confirming delivery; auditing freight bills; providing support for freight problems associated with shipping and receiving; and hazardous freight bill data entry into the U.S. Department of Energy’s Shipment Mobility and Accountability Collection (SMAC) data base as required by DOE order 460.2.

3.2	TS will provide timely (within 24 hours after first contact)  transportation services in the following areas:

•	Prepare bills of lading, air bills, dangerous goods declarations and manifests for all outbound radioactive shipments from PNNL.

•	Prepare Hanford site documentation for inbound radioactive material shipments.

•	Route commercial carriers (that inadvertently arrive at 1162 building) with PNNL’s non-radioactive hazardous material packages to Battelle’s shipping/receiving warehouse (790 building).  *(See note below.)

•	Input radioactive shipment data in the DOE-HQ SMAC and Automated Transportation Management System (ATMS) data base as required by DOE order 460.2.

•	Provide 24 hour on-call technical support for emergency response purposes for PNNL radioactive shipments on the road as required by DOT 49CFR regulations.

•	All personnel supporting this activity shall submit all documentation/reports associated with the specific scope of work.

*Note:  It may be economically advantageous for TS to handle final delivery of some non-radioactive hazardous material shipments that inadvertently arrive at 1162 building shipping/receiving facility.  TS should contact Battelle’s Shipping/Receiving Warehouse (375-5999) for guidance concerning this matter if it should arise.

The Municipality of Juiz de Fora (the “Grantee”) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a proposed light rail project that would relieve traffic congestion and support sustainable growth.  the Juiz de Fora Light Rail Project.  

Juiz de Fora is a growing city of approximately 500,000.  Traffic growth has overtaken the city’s existing system of bus franchises.  Light rail was identified as a potential solution when the city conducted its most recent Urban Transportation Master Plan in 1996-97.  The proposed light rail system would consist of two lines:  1) Santa Lucia-Vale dos Bandeirantes is proposed to run 7 kilometers along the principal downtown thoroughfare Avenida Rio Branco and would handle approximately 75% of the traffic volume. 2) Via Ideal-Benfica is proposed to run 19 kilometers on an existing rail track that is occupied by private freight rail concessionaire MRS Logistica.  This line is projected to initially handle about 25% of the passenger volume but traffic is expected to increase along with this rapidly growing area of the city.  The Grantee is the Municipality of Juiz de Fora and the Municipality’s Office of Planning and Strategic Management will be responsible for the feasibility study.

A summary of the specific tasks of the feasibility study is outlined below:

1.	Diagnostic/Review of Juiz de Fora Demand Studies
2.	Mass Transit Demand Update and Rates Scenarios
3.	Assessment of Infrastructure and Signaling Options
4.	Assessment of Vehicle Options
5.	Ticketing, Transfers and Passenger Flow Systems and Procedures
6.	System Recommendations and Final Report

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Kalin Barzov, Director General, Civil Aviation Administration, Ministry of Transport and Communications, 9 Dyakon Ignatii St., Sofia 1000, Bulgaria, Phone: 359-2-988-02-93, Fax: 359-2-980-53-37

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a comprehensive Security Master Plan for modernizing and restructuring the Romanian civil aviation security system.   

In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted a number of resolutions designed to ensure the safety of passengers, ground crew personnel, and the general public.  These resolutions have profound implications for the domestic civil aviation security programs of contracting states.  As such significant steps need to be taken to ensure the safety and security of Bulgaria’s airports.  The Bulgarian Director General of the Civil Aviation Administration and the Ministry of Transport and Communications have requested that USTDA conduct technical assistance for the Varna, Bourgas, Plovdiv and Gorna-Oriahovitza airports.  The civil aviation security assistance will evaluate current security policies and procedures, identify measures needed to comply with new ICAO standards, and develop an overall plan for modernizing and restructuring Bulgaria’s civil aviation security system.

The assistance would establish specific program and technological requirements necessary to modernize the Bulgarian civil aviation security at four of the nation’s international airports.  Commencing with a vulnerability analysis, the contractor should conduct a needs assessment to ascertain and validate specific requirements and estimate capital and operating costs for surveillance, access control, explosives detection, communications, and command and control.  This assessment should include plans, programs, equipment, training, and maintenance.  Requirements developed may include, but are not limited to: the means of gathering and sharing threat information; acquisition, installation, and training of equipment, such as intrusion detection, ID systems, explosives detection systems, passenger and baggage X-ray and metal detector systems and; the design of security and crisis/contingency plans and exercises to include the development and presentation of an integrated national training program applicable to each airport.  The final product of the assistance would be a Security Master Plan with precise quantities and specifications of required goods and services.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $296,530 grant to the Grantee from the (USTDA).

<DESC>16--The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Northrop Grumman (NG) Systems Corporation, 600 Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL 60008, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for the AN/AAQ-24 Directional Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCMs) to be installed on the production CV-22 aircraft.  As background information, under the MV-22/CV-22 contract, Bell-Boeing is responsible for the configuration and design of the CV-22 aircraft and the integration and installation of all avionic and electronic systems on the CV-22 aircraft, including equipment added as result of pre-planned product improvements (P3I).  A P3I Trade Study conducted by Bell-Boeing and synopsized on November 28, 1997, under PSA#1981, exhaustively surveyed industry to analyze all existing IRCMs.  Subsequently, the NG AN/AAQ-24 DIRCM system was selected as the best technical approach for the CV-22.   The Block 10 modification action was synopsized on 29 December 1998 to inform industry of a sole source procurement to Bell-Boeing Joint Venture Team for P3I to the CV-22 model aircraft.  The contract was awarded on 2 March 2000 under Contract No:  N00019-93-C-0006.  Part of the Block 10 modification required Bell-Boeing to reconfigure and redesign the CV-22 aircraft for the integration, installation and testing of the DIRCM system into the avionics and electronic architecture.  The implementation of the Block 10 contract modifications results in three (3) major reasons for this sole source action.  First, the trade study above determined that the DIRCM is the only system capable of meeting the CV-22 requirements.  Second, due to the significant design and integration efforts completed under Block 10, the NG DIRCM is the only IRCM that can currently be installed on the CV-22 without significant changes being required to the aircraft.  Third, the costs of approximately $50M dollars for the integration of the DIRCM on the CV-22 are not expected to be recovered through competition if other than the NG DIRCM is selected.  It is estimated that reconfiguration and redesign of the CV-22 aircraft, integration and testing of a new IRCM, would take between two and half to three years.  IRCM systems are needed in approximately the June 2005 timeframe to support the first two CV-22 production aircraft.   In addition to these three reasons justifying the sole source, the Government has always intended to transition the NG  MH-53 DIRCMs which were awarded under a limited competition, to the CV-22s when the MH-53s are retired.  The Government made this known in the MH-53 synopsis dated 16 December 2002.  It is anticipated that USSOCOM will modify the current MH-53 IRCM contract number USZA22-03-D-0005 to incorporate CV-22 DIRCM program content.  This action will add a quantity of forty-nine (49) DIRCM ship sets, associated spares of Group-B hardware and sustaining engineering and logistic support.  Hardware will be delivered as GFE to the Bell-Boeing CV-22 production team for subsequent integration and installation on CV-22 aircraft.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334511 and the small business size standard is 750 employees. The point of contact is Ms. Valerie Romanchek, Contracting Officer at romancv@socom.mil. See Note 22 for any responses to this announcement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) plans to award a sole source modification for a four-month extension and two one-month options to Alion Science and Technology in support of the Relability Analysis Center (RAC) under contract SP0700-97-D-4006.  Alion Science and Technology is the only source to provide RAC services within the required timeframe.  This action represents a bridge extension until a competitive follow-on acquisition is awarded.  Alion Science and Technology has the operational capability in place to provide for continuous DoD-wide demand for technical support in the area of reliability analyses.  Award to any other source would require transition and start-up time that would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling onginng critical agency requirements.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue award using other than full and open competition and should not be a request for competitive proposals.  The determination of the government not to sopen subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Design, manufacture and install an artificial pre-cast concrete modular marine reef to develop a habitat to sustain a coastal marine ecosystem in the area of Deadmans Island near Gulf Breeze, Florida.  This is a notice of sole source intent by the Mo bile District Corps of Engineers.  See Note 22.  Mobile District intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Artificial Reefs Inc., Gulf Breeze, FL, (850) 934-7201.  Artificial Reefs product is patented and has been installed-tested in other locations  and is approved by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.  This is the only known product that can meet all of the following requirements.  The artificial reef must be environmentally sensitive with similar characteristics of a natural barrie r reef, that would attract a full array of local marine species and promote marine growth on all surfaces of the reef, provide engineered openings to promote designed flow of micronutrient rich water across all surfaces and increase light access to promote  the rapid growth of marine life.  The design of the reef system must provide substantial cover and spawning habitat, contain the geometric and physical material properties similar to a breakwater in order to withstand wave heights and currents associated with a local 20-year storm events, as well as provide a structurally useful minimum 25 year life.  The referenced reef must abate erosion of Deadmans Island, and allow the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers to plant aquatic vegetation along the shoreline to imp rove both the aquatic and terrestrial habitat on the project area.  The barrier reef system shall be composed of pre-cast concrete units configured and sized to protect the shoreline of Deadmans Island near Gulf Breeze, FL from erosion processes resulting from average wind and wave conditions.  The project site encompasses an area of approximately 134,000 feet, with slopes from the shoreline to about minus 3 feet or minus 4 feet.  The bottom sediment is composed of sandy material. The crest elevation of the  breakwater shall be one (1) foot above Mean High Water.  Permitting requirements of Florida Department of Environmental Protection precludes the dredging of channels in the project area.  The contractor must provide a method of analysis to determine effec tiveness of the proposed breakwater design as well as a work plan to include drawings, specifications, and supporting technical documents for the fabrication and placement of 1,240 foot-long barrier reef/breakwater approximately 150 feet off the shoreline of Deadmans Island, Florida.  Deadmans Island is near the City of Gulf Breeze, near the mouth of Pensacola Bay about 16 miles from the Alabama-Florida state line.  Installation of the artificial reef/breakwater requires obtaining permits, namely Coastal Zo ne Certification and Water Quality Certification from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.  The contractor shall also coordinate with U.S. Coast Guard and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission regarding their requirements for  project navigation aids and warning signs, respectively.  The design documentation must include: 1) drawings must be in a CADD format depicting topographic and hydrographic survey data including the required alignment of the artificial reef/breakwater; 2)  method of analysis to determine effectiveness of reef/breakwater design/technical documents; 3) Technical specifications in Microsoft Word format; 4) manufacture and installation cost with schedules.  The solicitation has two line items.  The line item on e covers Phase I, the design phase and line item two is optional for the manufacture and installation of the artificial reef that if exercised would be a delay of 180 days between design approval process and contract modification to proceed to the manufact uring cycle.  The design, manufacture and installation must be completed by August 01, 2004.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considere d.

<DESC>The Defense Information System Agency (DISA)/ Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization – Europe (DITCO-Europe) hereby issues the following Request for Information (RFI) regarding commercial wireless telecommunication services and associated wireless equipment (i.e., cellular telephones, wireless personal digital assistants (PDAs), pagers, wireless routers, security identity module (SIM) chips, accessories, etc.).  A. PURPOSE:  The Government seeks information for the provision of wireless telecommunications services and equipment to be acquired for U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR) and other DITCO Europe customers within the United States European Command (USEUCOM) and the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) Area of Responsibilities (AORs) throughout Europe, Africa and Southwest Asia.  The information gathered from this RFI will assist in the development of a future Request for Proposal.  B. INTENT:  The RFI is intended to gather information about the availability of technology/products in the market place that will fulfill anticipated requirements for these services and other value-added elements. Information submitted in response to this RFI will become the property of the Government.  The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.  The Government will not pay for information provided, and is not liable for any costs incurred by the company in response to this RFI.  Price quotes are not required, however, general cost estimates are appreciated to assist in planning.  Cost estimates provided will not be binding for the company.  The competitive award of a two (2) year base period with four (4) two year option periods for a total of ten-years, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract (or multiple contracts, if determined to be in the best interest of the Government) is contemplated for an estimated 16,000 cellular telephone users and wireless PDA users.  C. DESIRED INFORMATION:  The Government desires information on industry capabilities to support the services and features listed below.  This list is neither detailed nor all-inclusive, but is a representative of the type of services the Government is interested in.  The Government will consider responses to this request for information in defining its requirements and alternatives.  The Contractor shall provide all Global System for Mobile (GSM) transmission facilities, equipment, materials, maintenance, test equipment, and design layout needed to provide this GSM service with its own GSM network infrastructure and its International GSM partners.  The government is interested in the following basic services for GSM cellular telephones: GSM Network access/dial tone, direct inward dialing, direct outward dialing, local exchange and long distance accesses, voice mail, operator assistance (0+ & 00+), directory assistance, data and facsimile numbers (as required), 110 services and other emergency services (where available), non-published directory number and roaming on conventional GSM networks.  Industry is encouraged to address other similar services available.  The Government is also interested in Industry’s most preferred type of automated billing for these type services.  In place of having the Contractor invoice for airtime based on charges for the initial minute of the call, and subsequent six (6) second increments, the Government is interested in procuring local and/or long distance calls on a flat monthly charge basis.  The International GSM service shall provide the Government the ability to place cellular telephone calls between all AOR countries, as well as the U.S. and as many other countries as possible.  In the event that network maturity in Europe, Africa, and Southwest Asia is not sufficient to permit pricing of long distance service on a flat monthly charge basis, the Government would like to know if a pricing differential between “peak” and “off-peak” usage is recommended or discouraged.  The Government’s definition of “peak is 0900 to 1800 hours at the call origination location, and “off-peak” is 1800 to 0900 hours at the call origination location.  New cellular telephones shall include user manuals in English.  Request comments on related accessories (i.e. hands-free headset, leather carrier, heavy-duty batteries, auto adapter, etc.) that may be made available for purchase under the contract.  The Government is interested in cellular telephones that meet or exceed the following functional specifications for Basic, Enhanced and Optimum cellular telephone packages.  Comments on the availability of additional functional specifications for these or similar packages is requested:  BASIC Package: standby time up to 150 hours, talk time up to 200 minutes, weight not to exceed 200 grams, integrated dictionary for SMS (T9 software), picture messaging, animated main menu, dual banding, quick access menu, VIP-calling identification and vibration alert; ENHANCED Package:  Same as BASIC package including standby time up to 250 hours, weight not to exceed 150 grams, multilingual capable/voice recognition, Triband (in lieu of dual banding), graphic display, voice memo, data/fax capable, infrared connectivity and Lithium-Ion battery; and OPTIMUM Package: Same as BASIC/ENHANCED packages including video camera feature/MMS, standby time up to 280 hours, Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) (in lieu of picture messaging) and bluetooth capability for laptop, headset.  Information on wireless PDAs (i.e. Blackberry’s), pagers, wireless routers, security identity module (SIM) chips, accessories, etc, is requested.  The Government is considering the ability to add technical enhancements for future wireless services and equipment that are determined to be in scope.  D. SUBMISSION OF COMMENTS:  All comments in response to this RFI should be submitted electronically via e-mail not later than 27 February 2004 using MS Word 7.0 or later.  The point-of-contacts for submitting comments are Mr. Reynaldo Ginete at gineter@hq.5sigcmd.army.mil and Mr. James Waples at waplesj@sembach.disa.mil.  Comments shall be submitted to both points of contacts.  Comments received after that date may not be considered.  Proprietary information should be identified as such.  Responses to the RFI shall include the Company Name, Street Address, City, State, Country, zip code or postal code, Point of Contact (POC), POC Telephone, facsimile number and e-mail address.  If the company address includes a post office box, the complete street address must also be provided.  Small Business Set Asides will not be authorized.

<SUBJECT>R -- DoD Team Bass Fishing Tournament Sponsorship Opportunity
<DESC>The 14th Annual DoD Team Bass Fishing Tournament sponsored by the Robins AFB 78th Services Division, Civilian Recreation, will be held from April 18 through the 23, 2004. This event will be held at Dale Hollow Lake in Byrdstown, TN. Last year we had over 145 teams competing in the fishing tournament giving us over 500 spectators for the week. The competing teams represented all five branches of the Armed Services and traveled from 31 different states. 
This year we anticipate maximum participation of two hundred teams. We would like to offer you the opportunity to play a part in this tournament by becoming a commercial sponsor. There are many different package levels to choose from for sponsorship. The package you choose determines the type of recognition you will receive. Some examples of the recognition your company may obtain are a banner hung during the entire tournament, company name and\or logo on the t-shirts, web-page and press release recognition just to name a few. We are also allowing sponsors to set up display tables during the week, which will include registration, the hospitality suite and weigh-in. We are looking for monetary or in-kind sponsorship from companies for trophies, t-shirts, door prizes and goody bags. 
If, for some reason, you are unable to become a sponsor at this time you can still be a part of the tournament. Donations (any contribution under $500) are always welcome and will definitely help us to once again have a fist-class tournament. All donors will receive a one time recognition on a special banner hung throughout the tournament.  
Would your company like to be a part of the DOD Team Bass Fishing Tournament event this year?  If so, please contact Marisa Barber no later than March 26, 2004 at (478) 926-6692.

<SUBJECT>B -- Salmon Imprinting and Reproduction Research
<DESC>This publication serves as a notice of intent to procure, on a sole-source basis, with the University of Washington (UW).  There are two main components to the required work:  1) determine the critical periods for imprinting by sockeye salmon by exposing juvenile salmon to known odorants at key developmental sates and testing fish for long-term memory of these odorants.  The following are required for the work: a) maintain odor exposure equipment and odorants, b) conduct biweekly sampling of fish for tissue and physiological assays to assess smolting and imprinting, c) analysis of data from video-taped odor choice experiments, and d) electro-olfactogram assessments of 3+ year old imprinted sockeye salmon, and 2) determine endocrine mechanism whereby body growth affects age of sexual maturity and oocyte development in coho and chinook salmon, and determine effects of photoperiod manipulation on spawn timing in spring chinook salmon.  The following are required for this work: a) rearing of chinook and coho salmon on specified rations to control growth rate in different groups of experimental fish, b) collection of tissues and plasma from experimental fish, c) measurement of plasma and pituitary gonadotropins, plasma sex steroids, and IGF I by radioimmunossay, d) measurement of ovarian gene transcripts (gonadotopin and growth hormone receptors, IGF I and IGF II, steroid acute regulatory protein) from experimental fish by real time PCR, e) design of photoperiod regime to manipulate spawn time, f) histological analysis of goad development from experimental fish, g) analyze carcass samples for lipid levels, and h) statistical analyses and interpretation of data collected from experimental fish.  All analyses and fish rearing will be conducted at the NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, Northwest Fisheries Science Center, Seattle, WA.  The period of performance will begin on date of contract award (approx. mid-April 2004) and continue through three months.****The Government intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with the UW, as we believe this is the only source with such  unique expertise, qualifications and experience to perform the work.  All interested concerns must submit documentation in writing demonstrating the capability, expertise, qualifications and experience to perform the necessary work to Sharon Kent, NOAA, WASC, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle WA.

<SUBJECT>B -- Mission Solution Analysis Kick-off
<DESC>The Space and Missile System Center (SMC) will host a Mission Solution Analysis (MSA) Kick-off meeting at 9 March 2004 at the Fort MacArthur Community Center Ballroom, San Pedro, CA and on 10 March 2004 at SMC Area A, El Segundo, CA. The goal of the conference is to provide Industry and the Air Force Research Laboratory with insight into our focus for MSA and request participation in the SMC/TD-led Technical Planning Integrated Product Teams (TPIPT) supporting Air Force Space Command's (AFSPC) FY08 Integrated Planning Process (IPP). The IPP is the foundation for AFSPC's long range strategic planning of its future space missions and force structure. After IPP's Mission Area Assessment defines AFSPC's capabilities, and Mission Need Analysis defines AFSPC's mission needs, MSA develops candidate materiel solutions for those needs across the 20-year planning horizon.  These solutions are then evaluated during an Integrated Investment Analysis (IIA) that identifies investment strategy options for consideration by AFSPC leadership. The first session, on 09 March 2004, will consist of presentations of the AFSPC FY06 IPP cycle mission needs, a review of concepts analyzed in the FY06 IPP cycle, ongoing TPIPT concept development activity and the way ahead for each AFSPC Mission Area (Space Support (SS), Force Enhancement (FE), Counterspace (CS), Force Application (FA) and Mission Support (MS)).   The second session, on 10 March 2004, will consist of Mission Area break-out sessions where more detailed discussions can occur and additional information will be provided to focus concept development efforts.  A Request for Information (RFI) will be published following this conference requesting concepts from Industry for the FY08 IPP cycle based on the information and focus presented at this conference.
