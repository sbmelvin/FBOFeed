<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for HC-38m specially-fabricated circuit board (containing 7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGAs) associated on-board memory and communications circuitry)to upgrade an existing NASA-owned Starbridge Hypercomputer. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Star Bridge System, Inc. as the only known source which can meet Agency needs.  This special board is designed to exploit the Viva iconic "gateway*" (graphic programming language) used at NASA Langley to develop pathfinder scientific applications begun on a first-generation StarBridge Hypercomputer and being significantly extended on the more capable (120x more powerful) current generation StarBridge System already at NASA Langley.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to generate the data necessary to recreate this system and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 11, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>USAID/Caucasus/Georgia intends to issue a solicitation for Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee completion contract for the Georgia Microfinance Stabilization and Enhancement Activity (GMSE).  GMSE aims to create stable and operationally sustainable Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), including rural credit in Georgia.  It provides funds, technical assistance and training to increase the stability of selected institutions in Georgia through the emulation of best practices worldwide.  It further seeks to enhance the long term sustainability of MFIs through innovative product development, improved lending methodologies, and the development of fora for sharing of information and common monitoring procedures.  The activity outlined is planned to be implemented over four years to focus on improving the stability of small and microfinance institutions in Georgia and enhancing their capacity to provide sustainable financial services to small and micro enterprises. USAID estimates the total cost of GMSE not to exceed $10 million, including funds for grants.   The Georgia Micro-Finance Stabilization Activity addresses the Mission's Strategic Objective 1.3 'Accelerated Development and Growth of Private Enterprises'. It will support the achievement of Intermediate Result (IR) 1.3.1. 'Improved Policy and Operating Environment' and specifically IR 1.3.2, 'Increased Access to Credit'.  The GMSE activity will be implemented through the following seven inter-related tasks:  task 1 - promote the establishment of unambiguous legal status and tax treatment of non-bank MFIs; task 2 - increase operational and financial sustainability of non-bank MFIs; task 3 - develop partnerships between commercial banks with branch networks and non-bank MFIs to provide additional financial services to MFI clients; task 4 - increase MFI institutional capacity; task 5 - develop baseline indicators and small and microenterprise financial/market information and statistics; task 6- develop a public information program to promote the values and practice of sustainable microfinance; and, task 7 - design, launch, manage and monitor the Credit Innovation Grant Program.  It is anticipated that up to $5 million will be available from USAID/Caucasus for the Credit Innovation Grant Program.  Funds for the grants will be provided to the contractor on an incremental basis.  Respondents should propose indicators in order to monitor and measure achievement of the results. The indicators proposed by the winning contractor shall be used as the minimum basis for determining a final set of indicators.  Since a number of donors are active in small and microfinance in Georgia, collaboration with other donors is necessary to assure that all programs have complementary objectives and methodologies.  The contractor shall coordinate with other donors on a number of tasks under this activity as described above. 
USAID/Caucasus/Georgia anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about February 14, 2003.

<DESC>A?INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Advanced Guidance Division (AFRL/MNG) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for the development of a new target source chamber and optical relay for the Kinetic Kill Vehicle Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulator (KHILS) facilities vacuum cold chamber (KVACC) to better align the parameters and capabilities with AFRL requirements.  This acquisition is considered restricted to small business only (Small Business Set-aside) and only U.S. firms may submit offers as prime contractors.  Firms responding to this solicitation should provide their business status as defined in FAR clause 52.219-1 for NAICS Code 339111 (500 people).  Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement and must be received no later then 1:00 PM central standard time 15 Oct 2002.  Address proposals to AFRL/MNK, Suite 337, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810, Attn: Judie Jacobson.  Proposals submitted after the cut-off date specified herein shall be treated in accordance with FAR 52-215-1(c)(3), "Instructions to Offerors -- Competitive Acquisition".  Responders must reference the above solicitation number MNK-PRDA-02-0008 on the outside of the package or in the subject line of an e-mail submission.  Since this is a PRDA, there will be no formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this announcement. Offerors should be alert to any PRDA amendments that may be published.  B--REQUIREMENTS: (1) Technical Description:  The KHILS facility develops advanced HWIL test technologies and provides a realistic ground-test environment for quantifying the performance of precision-guided weapons.  The KVACC system consists of three modular chambers, with each chamber designed for a specific function and housing a unique sub-element of the HWIL simulation test hardware. The three chambers are the main optical chamber, the source chamber, and the sensor chamber.  The entire multi-chamber grouping is supported on a common optical table isolated from ground vibrations.  Gate valves separate the three chambers and offer the capability to work with the smaller antechambers more easily than having to cycle the larger main (optical) chamber.  A closed-cycle helium refrigerator provides cryogenic cooling of the chamber components.  The KVACC system provides a complete cryogenic optical system, a complex infrared target projection system, and a surrogate sensor subsystem that meets the required optical, radiometric, and environmental conditions for hardware-in-the-loop testing of infrared guidance systems requiring exo-atmospheric temperature and altitude conditions.  To simulate these conditions infrared resistor array scene projectors are used.  The original design for KVACC anticipated a scene projector with an image size roughly 80% larger on edge than currently available projector arrays allow for. The limited size of cryogenic projector arrays over the next 3-5 years limits the Field of View of the KVACC projection system and limits the capabilities of the KHILS facility.  An optical relay is required to map current projector arrays into the full image size of the existing KVACC optics.  A larger source chamber is required to house the relay optics, two resistor arrays mounted on translation and rotation stages and associated beamcombiner and neutral density filter, an optional point source blackbody with aperture wheel, and an optional extended blackbody source.  (2) Technical Goals:  The basic program will be for the design and development of the optical relay, new source chamber and associated component mounting surfaces, and any optical table extensions and isolators required to support the larger chamber. The basic system must also accommodate the optional subsystems. The basic program will be broken into two phases.  Phase I (3 months) will produce a detailed design with engineering specifications sufficient for manufacture of the source chamber , optical relay, and support structure.  Phase I will conclude with the detailed design presented at a Configuration Design Review (CDR) and contingent on government approval of the design.  Phase II (9 months) will include the manufacture, integration, installation and acceptance testing of the total system at the KHILS facility at Eglin AFB, FL.  Additionally, there will be four options established in the contract for different calibration sources: (a) the extended blackbody source (b) variable diameter point source with aperture wheel (c) supplemental cryo-cooling system upgrade (d) and a duplicate optical assemblyIt is the intent of this modification program to perform all changes and modifications in the source chamber and to make little or no changes to the sensor and optics chambers.  The program will end upon successful completion of a Site Acceptance Test (SAT) and delivery of all final documentation.  Specific technical requirements are contained in a document entitled "Specifications and Statement of Requirements For KHILS Vacuum Cryogenic Chamber Modifications" that can be obtained by contacting 1Lt James Norman, AFRL/MNGG, (850) 882-4446 ext 2244, e-mail: james.norman2@eglin.af.mil, and providing a DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement (3) Data Requirements: Developmental Design Drawings and Associated Lists (DI-SESS-81002B); Scientific and Technical Reports - Design Notebook (DI-MISC-80711A/T); Acceptance Test Plan (DI-NDTI-8566); Test/Inspection Report (DI-NDTI-80809B); Presentation Materials (DI-ADMN-81373/T); Conference Minutes (DI-ADMN-81250A); User's Manual (DI-MISC-81414); Status Report ? Monthly (DI-MGMT-80368).  (4) Meetings and Reviews:  The contractor will be expected to host and conduct various meetings and reviews throughout the program.

E--PROPOSAL EVALUATION:  (1) Award Evaluation Criteria:  The selection of one source for contract award shall be based on scientific and engineering evaluation of the proposals in response to this PRDA to determine best-value to the Government for the entire program.  Proposals will be evaluated as received using the following factors.  No other evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals.  Technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  The factors in descending order of importance are:  (a) the overall technical merits of the written proposal;  (b) The soundness of the approach, including the proper definition and arrangement of tasks, and the probability of meeting the Government's technical goals; (c) The offerors capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, key personnel, subcontractors, or unique combination of these factors which are integral factors for achieving the Government's technical goals; (d) The offeror's technical management and administrative capabilities including technical program management resources necessary to comply with program objectives and past and present performance on government contracts; and (e) The reasonableness, realism, and completeness of proposed cost for the total program.

<DESC>The Navy has a requirement for nine (9) Multi Function Displays (P/N 822-0975-005 and NSN 7025-01-469-8448) to be delivered by Oct 03.  The function of the MFD is to work in conjunction with both the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), and Terrain Avoidance Warning System (TAWS) as a display for visual information.  Rockwell Collins is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the MFD 255M, P/N 822-0975-005, with software unique to PMA-209 TAWS/TCAS. These Multi Function Displays are only known units that are compatible with the Operational Flight Program (OFP 091-1910-002) and corresponding Character set 091-1911-001.  The MFD 255M is the only TAWS/TCAS MFD that has been tested through OPEVAL for use with the Navy. The MFD 255M is installed in C/KC-130F/R/T, and C-2A aircraft. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. In addition, Rockwell is the only known source capable of meeting the Navy's requirements and delivery schedule of Oct. 03.  See Note 22.

<DESC>Currently, troubleshooting and routine administration of Military Sealift Commands  (MSC) network(s) are performed by afloat personnel and augmented by visiting technicians. The Remote Administration Technical Center (RAFT) project is intended to create a shore-based team of highly trained and knowledgeable technicians. This team will administer, troubleshoot, repair and inventory MSC ships worldwide from ONE centralized location. The goal of RAFT is to reduce the need to man ships with highly trained IT personnel while improving the speed and quality of support. MSC RAFT Center will provide remote network administration of shipboard LAN(s) and associated equipment. Administration will be done while ships are pier side and deployed (i.e., at sea), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A ship may contain one or more LAN(s), each consisting of up to 120 desktops and / or servers and asso ciated equipment. In May and June of 2002, an RFI was conducted to ascertain the existence of possible software solutions for this remote administration and training for such. After review of the submissions, the customer concluded that no one product would meet their needs, as stated in the RFI. In preparation for issuance of a solicitation, a vendor conference will be held on February 25th, 2003 from 8:30 - 17:00. Conference location: Holiday Inn (West) 5401 Carlisle Pike Mechanicsburg, Pa. 17050 Phone: 717-697-0321 There will be two breaks and a lunch during the conference. Refreshments will be available at no cost during the breaks. Lunch will be at the participants expense. The hotel has a restaurant on the premises. Harrisburg International (MDT / HIA) is the local airport. All businesses, large and small, are invited to attend the conference. Howev er, in accordance with FAR, the solicitation will be restricted to small businesses only. Large businesses wishing to submit proposals are encouraged to partner with a small business. We will NOT serve as a broker for vendors wishing to partner. So that we may provide an accurate participant count to the hotel, if you plan to attend, please provide us with your company name, your name, and phone. If your company intends to bring multiple people, please tell us how many. Please have participant information to us, via email or phone by 1:00 P.M., February 7th; email is preferable. The primary purpose of the conference is to discuss technical details as they relate to the customers needs. We encourage interested vendors, whether attending or not, to submit questions via email prior to the conference; this will allow us time to begin formulating answers. Questions can be sen t until 4:00 P.M., February 19th. A list of questions and answers will be provided within a few days after the conference. Please provide participant information to: Chris Seier Phone: 717-605-2189 Fax: 717-605-4600 Email: chris_r_seier@icpmech.navy.mil (preferable) Our only question: How much detail is needed about the currently installed infrastructure? I.e., do vendors need to know complete system specifications, including CPU speeds, amount of installed memory, make / model of desktops and servers, routers and switches, installed software including version numbers and quantities, etc.? Copies of maps, directions and the RFI information are available from the Contract Specialist. The RFI number was N00104-02-R-Q544. Chris Seier is the point of contact for this conference notice.

<ARCHDATE>01292004
<CONTACT>Kris Swofford Contracting Officer 4154645105 Kris_Swofford@nps.gov;
<DESC>Point Reyes National Seashore seeks hydrologic services and analysis in the planning of a wetlands restoration project for the former Giacomini Ranch in Tomales Bay, California.  The project area is located at the southern end of Tomales Bay at the mouth of Lagunitas Creek, the largest subwatershed within the Bay.  It is bordered by the town of Point Reyes Station to the east and Inverness Park to the west, in Marin County, CA.  Diverse hydrologic influences have resulted in extensive wetland development over much of the project area.  Most of these wetlands are considered 'wet pasture' and are dominated by non-native annual and perennial grasses.  However, portions of the project area where a mosaic of riparian, marsh, and wet pasture is present were found to support a large number of common and special status wildlife species.  This wildlife diversity is further enhanced by the proximity of habitats such as evergreen forest, coastal scrub, and undiked salt marsh that occur on the periphery of the project area.  This project will be integral to the development of restoration alternatives.  Efforts will be focused on restoring hydrologic processes and to improve and/or refine preliminary alternatives proposed to ensure that those selected for inclusion in a future environmental document are hydrologically feasible and do not violate any of the project objectives.  Once the alternatives have been selected, modeling and/or other hydrologic analysis should be conducted to better quantify the conditions expected to occur and degree of potential impacts, both positive and negative.  Specific tasks will include:  Update historic information on hydrologic conditions in the project area; determine the hydrologic issues that will need to be considered when developing restoration alternatives (i.e., current sediment loads, sediment transport patterns, strategy with regards to existing streams present, strategy for development or reinitiation of tidal creeks/slough network, strategy with regards to flood risks, potential effects associated with sea level rise, etc.); improve and/or refine preliminary alternatives proposed by others on hydrologic feasibility; conduct hydrologic modeling and other methods of hydrologic analysis; evaluate hydrologic impacts to habitat for special status species; prepare plans of both preliminary alternatives and final alternatives selected; attend internal and external meetings to present and/or answer questions with regards to hydrological issues presented; and produce a draft and final technical report.  Key personnel must have a strong academic and professional background in hydrology, including a thorough understanding of both tidal and freshwater hydrologic processes; must have demonstrated an understanding of issues crucial to successful tidal wetland restoration design and have implemented this understanding through design of alternatives for tidal wetland restoration projects; must have demonstrated experience conducting hydrologic modeling and analyses of tidal wetland restoration projects, including determining feasibility and potential benefits and impacts of conceptual alternatives proposed; and must have demonstrated experience in collecting and analyzing field data determined to be required for hydrologic modeling and analysis.  A technical proposal will be required.  Selection will be based on the following criteria:  1) Demonstrated experience in hydrologic planning of wetland restoration projects, specifically tidal wetland restoration projects.  The key individual should have had primary responsibility for hydrologic analysis for at least three tidal wetland restoration projects; 2) Level of expertise and appropriateness demonstrated in the detailed technical approach for implementing the project work; 3) Demonstrated understanding of the hydrologic issues that need to be taken into consideration when undertaking a tidal wetland restoration project, particularly one that incorporates both tidal and freshwater influences; and 4) Demonstrated cost-effectiveness of the proposed approach in meeting the project work.  The proposed contract period of performance is expected to conclude in approximately one year.  Issuance of the Request for Proposal (RFP) is expected to be on or about February 20, 2003 with proposals due 30 days thereafter. The RFP will be available for electronic access only at http://www.fedbizopps.gov, or directly through the DOI National Business Center website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  This acquisition is unrestricted.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which, if timely received, will be considered.  The participation in this acquisition by Small Business Concerns is encouraged.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Michigan, Institute for Social Research, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105. The project looks to establish the planning documentation and epidemiological sample frame for conducting a longitudinal study that disentangles the confounding effects of race and socio-economic status on long-term healthy aging. The goal of this project will focus on creating new survey sampling methodologies and applications unique to a diverse and complex population, spanning numerous and various socio-economic patterns, with a particular focus on assessment made by a longitudinal study. This study requires a detailed knowledge of the public health characteristics of this region and the ways in which we must collect racial and socioeconomic demographic data to assess their influence on a variety of health outcomes such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular functioning, psychophysiological and cognitive performance, and muscular strength and conditioning. This project will create the underlying planning documentation and epidemiological justifications for defining a sampling population and creating new survey sampling methods and applications required to perform a scientifically valid longitudinal study.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to release Request for Proposal (RFP) N00039-02-R-0016 for a replacement system for the existing Clarinet MERLIN Receiving System (CMRS).  This effort will include the production, integration, testing, installation, documentation and maintenance of the entire CMRS including the antenna, receiver, communications system to the Broadcast Control Authority (BCA), and the operator interface/display. Engineering Services will also be required.  The present CMRS is a shore based receiving system that monitors transmissions from the Submarine Emergency Communication Transmitter (SECT) buoys (AN/BST-1) launched from SSBN submarines.  The receiver sites are strategically located at six sites, three covering the Atlantic Ocean and three covering the Pacific Ocean.   In addition, one or more MERLIN receivers (based on the proposed CMRS) may be ordered.  SPAWAR anticipates awarding a single Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract in fiscal year 2003, incorporating Fixed-Price Line Items. A Statement of Work (SOW) will be provided to prospective offerors. Offerors will be required to provide (i) a technical proposal, (ii) past performance information, and (iii) cost proposal. The performance requirements for the CMRS are to receive, recognize and decode AN/BST-1 buoy transmissions and deliver the messages to the BCA as soon as possible in certain operational areas and within 24 hours of buoy activation in all operational areas with a 95% minimum probability.  Additional requirements include:  the system shall operate automatically without operator intervention and with minimum operator attention; the system shall be designed for low maintenance, minimum adjustment, high reliability, and high end-to-end system availability; the system shall be capable of conducting periodic system checks and continuous Built-In-Tests (BIT) to ensure the receiver is operational; and the system shall be capable of controlling several diversely-located CMRS(s) simultaneously from the BCA.  An offeror must have a SECRET facility clearance to review classified documents referenced in the SOW and contractor personnel must have at least a SECRET clearance to access the BCA. The RFP is expected to be issued approximately 18 February 2003, and will be available at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil under solicitation number N00039-02-R-0016. Click on Business Opportunities; then Headquarters; then Open Solicitation; then click on the yellow folder to the left of N00039-02-R-0016. No other notice will appear in FedBizOpps.

To subscribe, click on N00039-02-R-0016; then click on ?Subscribe? near the top of the screen, and follow the directions provided. A DETERMINATION HAS BEEN MADE TO SET ASIDE THIS PROCUREMENT AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 334220.

<CONTACT>JOE MCHUGH CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487309     jfmchugh@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey has a requirement to establish a new information component of the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) entitled the Northeast Urban Biodiversity Node.  The NBII is a web-based system that provides data and information on the nations biological resources. It links biological databases, information products and analytical tools maintained by the NBII partners and other contributors in government agencies, academic institutions, non-government organizations, and private industry. The Northeast Urban Biodiversity Node is a new informational component that will be a on-line data and information service focused on the ecology, invasive species, and emerging infectious diseases. The node will contain data on the New York City Watersheds, the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area, and the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. Under this USGS initiative, the current data in the node will be expanded to include additional ecological data to be integrated into the Northeast Node. In order to gain access to the data currently contained in the Northeast Node and integrate it into NBII, the USGS intends to enter into a sole source contract with the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) located at Columbia University. This data is thought to be available only from CIESIN. CIESIN has developed the current database and has sole ownership of it due to its previous work performed through numerous partnerships with Federal, state and non-governmental institutions and groups. All   potential sources who believe that they could provide the data in the CIESIN database and provide on line access to it for use by interested researches and governmental decision makers should provide a capability statement demonstrating their ability to gain access to the data and perform the work necessary to integrate the data into the NBII. All capability statements are due by 45 days from the date of this notice. See Numbered Note 22.*****

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION?Integrated, Automated Information System (IAIS) This notice identifies the Department of Justice (DOJ), Immigration and Naturalization Service?s (INS) intent to acquire an integrated solution that will maintain one current address of record for aliens in the U.S.  This Automated Information System (AIS) will interface with operational INS systems which currently maintain alien addresses.  Currently INS receives and processes between 6 and 9 million application each year.  INS admits between 1.4 and 1.7 million people each year.  Any address information received on initial contact would be entered into this system.  In addition, each time an alien in the United States changes his or her address, the updated information would be recorded in the proposed system.  INS currently has 22 million active files in its system.  For the six months from August 2002 to January 2003, the INS has received over 850,000 change of address forms.

The systems that maintain this alien address information are: The Refugees, Asylum & Parole System (RAPS); The Computer-linked Application Information Management System (CLAIMS3);  The Asylum Pre-Screening System (APSS); The Automated Nationwide System for Immigration Review (ANSIR); The Deportable Alien Control System (DACS); The Private Attorney Maintenance System (PAMS); The Computer-Linked Application Information Management System (CLAIMS4); The Re-engineered Naturalization Application Casework System (RNACS);The Marriage Fraud Amendment Act System (MFAS); The Change of Address by Phone Service (COA); The Non-Immigrant Information System (NIIS); Bond Management System (BMIS), Employment Authorization Document System (EADS), Enforcement Case Tracking System (Enforce), General Counsel Electronic Management System (GEMS), Global Enrollment System (GES), Juvenile Alien Management System (JAMS), Parole Case Tracking System (PCTS), Student and Schools System (STSC), Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), and the Arrival/Departure Information System (ADIS).   

The INS is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit information from commercial entities capable of providing the services and products described herein.  The system will have to comply with architectural, technical, security, business processes and legislative requirements.  INS receives and processes between 6 and 9 million application each year.  
This RFI is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but, rather, is an exploratory request to identify capabilities, obtain expressions of interest, determine the availability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products, market information and contractor capabilities for Government planning purposes.  The IAIS team is seeking to identify and resolve concerns regarding the feasibility of the requirements, integration of the various technologies, and other industry concerns or questions related to this acquisition.  

PROCUREMENT STRATEGY 
Procurement and implementation may be sought at a later date through the issuance of a statement of work and RFP.  It is anticipated that any such future solicitation could result in an award to multiple offerors.  

SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION
Respondents are asked to provide information that outlines specific capabilities of products and services that may satisfy the broad Governmental requirements as noted herein.  Also, to be addressed is any information relative to the NAIC Codes:54152, Sic Code: 7373, (Business type, size). The Government is also interested in relevant experience and contractor qualifications to perform the work envisioned.  This RFI is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an RFP or ultimately to award a contract.  Responses provided by industry will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this RFI.  Any costs incurred as a result of responding to this RFI shall be borne by the respondent and cannot be charged to the Government for reimbursement.

RNACS provides full case tracking and management capability for naturalization casework including assignment of cases to Case Control Offices (CCO); queuing of cases for appropriate actions, scheduling interviews and oath ceremonies; editing all batch and on-line transactions to prevent erroneous or untimely case update; producing scheduled reports (daily, weekly, monthly) and on-demand statistical and management reports; produces user correspondence?application receipt acknowledgment, interview, re-interview, and oath ceremony notices. RNACS maintains interfaces with CIS, RAFACS, C4, C3, the FBI and the CIA. 
The Marriage Fraud Amendment Act System (MFAS) is a centralized IDMS system located on the IBM mainframe computer.  MFAS is a case tracking system which supports the adjudication of petitions covered by the Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendment Act (IMFA) of 1986.
The Change of Address by Phone Service (COA) is a web-based system with an Oracle back-end where the National Customer Service Center captures N-400 applicant change of address requests and transmits these requests to the CoA system.  The system interfaces with RNACS and CLAIMS4 which attempt to automatically apply the change to the system.  If the change can not be applied automatically, Exception Processors in the field access the COA system via the web to identify the reason the address could not be automatically applied and take the appropriate steps to resolve the exception.   Notices are mailed from the Nebraska Service Center notifying the applicant of the result of the COA request.
The Bond Management Information System (BMIS) is a centralized database that maintains the records on immigration bonds. It also generates forms, letters, and bills associated with bonds and interfaces with DACS. The system supports personnel at HQ, regions, and field offices who require bond information in the performance of their duties. BMIS resides on the IBM mainframe at the Dept. of Justice Data Center in Dallas, TX. 
The Employment Authorization Document System (EADS) is a standalone PC system used to capture data and generate a standardized identification document issued to aliens authorized to be temporarily employed in the U.S. The information contained on the card is stored in an automated database where it can be accessed by terminal inquiry. Data from EADS is uploaded to CLAIMS 3.0 to provide a consolidated record.
The Enforcement Case Tracking System (ENFORCE) is a case management system for INS enforcement activities that integrates a collection of automated case management and functional systems for arrest bookings. By automating the manual booking processes, builds a knowledge base from which criminal activities can be analyzed to identify local and international criminal organizations involved in alien smuggling, document counterfeiting, and fraudulent immigration schemes. The long-term goal for ENFORCE is an integrated, unified collection of applications to support enforcement from detection of illegal entry to deportation or other disposition. ENFORCE includes the development, deployment, incorporation, integration, and revision of a variety of subsystems. Enforcement Integrated Database (EID) serves as a data repository for these subsystems.  It is an UNIX Oracle based system.
The General Counsel Electronic Management System (GEMS) is an application targeted to be installed in General Counsel, Regional Counsel offices, and District Counsel offices service-wide. The system will be comprised of six components: case tracking, project tracking, document tracking, electronic scheduling system, time accounting, and legal research access. It is an UNIX Oracle based system.
The Global Enrollment System (GES) was established as an automated system that enrolls low-risk frequent travelers in various INS Automated Inspection PortPass programs. After enrollment, travelers are issued a PASS card to facilitate the automated validation process when they enter the United States through SENTRI/DCL, APP/RVI, or INSPASS. GES is a comprehensive enrollment system and database that will provide enrolled passenger information to all PortPass validation systems. The system collects biographic and biometric data from travelers in one central database that will be available to a variety of PortPASS validation programs
The Justice Automated Messaging System (JAMS)  combines Message Distribution Terminals (MDT) Hub and GateGuard terminals with an Automated Message Handling System (AMHS) to provide automated and secure delivery of messages throughout the Department. JAMS is directly connected to the Pentagon Telecommunications Center which serves as the primary interface (or gateway) for the Department to the Department of Defense's Automated Digital Network (Autodin). The MDT Hub also has backside links to the Immigration and Naturalization (INS), Justice Command Center (]CC), Justice Telecommunications System (JUST), and various GateGuard communications terminals throughout the Department. 
The goal of Parole Case Tracking System (PCTS) is to allow capture of Significant Public Benefit  Parole (SPBP) application and decision information, and to allow tracking of a parolee?s status until his departure from the United States.
The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was established to fully automate the data capture and processing for foreign students and exchange visitors seeking academic student and family (F), vocational student and family (M), or exchange visitor and family (J) non-immigrant status to attend a school or participate in an exchange program in the United States. SEVIS will aid schools/ exchange visitor programs and students/exchange visitors in maintaining appropriate status, as well as electronically capturing school/exchange program and student/exchange visitor activities, supporting document reduction, departure management, enforcement activities, and the electronic processing of student benefits and changes in status. SEVIS is the result of reengineering the INS students and schools business processes. From this reengineering process, an operational prototype was fielded at 21 schools, the Atlanta Port-of-Entry (POE), and the Texas Service Center. It is an UNIX Oracle based system.

The Students and Schools System (STSC) tracks the status of alien students in the United States and the schools authorized to enroll these students. STSC provides an online capability that allows users to track foreign students attending U.S. colleges and universities and identify schools that students can attend. The production environment is divided into two subsystems. The user subsystem includes the databases and application software required to allow the users to access data online; the operations subsystem includes databases and application software used to run jobs by the INS Production Control Center. All STSC databases and application software reside on the mainframe at the JDC. The system is being reengineered to implement electronic processing of student forms and creation of a student registration card.

The Non-Immigrant Information System (NIIS) is an IDMS mainframe system accessible to all INS offices with access to the DOJ computer. It stores arrival and departure records for non-immigrant foreign nationals and provides automation support for tracking their arrivals and departures
The Arrival/Departure Information System (ADIS) is a client server application with an Oracle backend that was established to create a centralized database that will store arrival and departure data for all non-U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.  ADIS has now been replaced by VWPPA which is a web-based system using an Oracle backend and MQSeries.

<SUBJECT>41--TECHNOLOGY TO CONVERT EXISTING BUILDING AND HVAC GEOMETRY TO INDUSTRY FOUNDATION CLASSES (IFC) 2X MODEL ARCHITECTURE
<SOLNBR>N0017803Q3009
<RESPDATE>043003
<ARCHDATE>10302003
<CONTACT>XDS13-6     (540) 653-7765
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) is soliciting sources for ideas and concepts to design and develop technologies or techniques that hold the potential to convert existing building geometry (e.g., walls, doors, and windows), Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) geometry (e.g., duct sizes, locations, and types), and HVAC control information (e.g., fan CFM, airflows, and pressure drops) into the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) 2x model architecture.  Potential solutions can input converted data into the IFC 2x model either by modifying existing or creating new extension modules.  NSWCDD also solicits ideas and concepts to convert IFC files to a specified project zonal model file.  The goal is to automatically convert existing building and HVAC information obtained from blueprints and electronic drawing programs (i.e., AutoCAD, Microstation,  and others) into an IFC module or module extensions; then use the IFC data to generate the required information to support the zonal airflow modeling of the described building.  Sources may respond with solutions for converting the existing formats to the IFC 2x model and extensions, IFC output files to the zonal model file, or both. Building and HVAC geometry currently exists in a variety of hard (i.e., blueprints) and soft forms (i.e., CAD files).  These various forms present a significant challenge to the timely use of this information for computer modeling purposes.  The desired solution will translate this information into a single format usable in a zonal model currently under development. Current processes require individuals to physically extract relevant data (e.g., geometry data and control information) from existing drawings and input the relevant information  into the zonal model.  This process is labor-demanding, time intensive, and presents many opportunities for inaccuracies.  NSWCDD desires a process that automates the extraction and conversion processes from a variety of CAD systems to the IFC 2x model and extensions with high accuracy during translation. The IFC 2x model is a product of the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI).  IAI developed the 2x model to provide for the exchange and sharing of information between different software applications either of the same or different types.  To learn more about the IFC 2x model, visit the IAI website at http://www.iai-international.org/iai_international/.  Also, IFC 2x documentation can be found at http://cig.bre.co.uk/iai_international/Technical_Documents/iai_documents.html  For this announcement, building geometry includes those components that define the sha pe, volume, and openings associated with a stationary structure.  Items to consider are, but not limited to, the placement, size, and type of exterior and interior windows, doors, walls, and ceilings including suspended or false types.  Also, solutions need to consider concepts for leakage values for all exterior and interior openings (e.g., windows, doors, and suspended ceilings) associated with the building. HVAC geometry includes those components that define the shape, volume, and openings associated with the HVAC system of a stationary structure.  Items to consider are, but not limited to, duct sizes, duct types, duct location and routing, plenum size, types and location of intakes, exhausts, and dampers. HVAC control includes those components that regulate temperature and airflow associated with a stationary structure.  Items to consider are, but not limited to, fan  speeds, flow rates, damper closing and opening times, intake and exhaust flows, pressure information, sensor types, and start and stop trip points.  Also, consider how the HVAC system responds to actions based on sensor trips and inputs (e.g., dampers close, exhaust fan starts, heater starts or stops). NSWCDD also seeks approaches to generate IFC outputs into a government defined format file for use in a zonal model currently under development.  NSWCDD is using the CONTAMW 2.0 airflow modeling and simulation tool as the core for the zonal model under development.  CONTAMW 2.0 is a multizone indoor air quality and ventilation analysis computer program developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  CONTAMW 2.0 can predict airflows, contaminant concentrations, and personal exposure to airborne contaminants for eventual risk assessment. CONTAMW 2.0 i s usable for a variety of applications.  CONTAMW 2.0 can calculate building airflows to assess the adequacy of ventilation rates in a building and to estimate the impact of envelope air tightening efforts on infiltration rates.  The prediction of contaminant concentrations can determine the indoor air quality performance of a building before it is constructed and occupied, to investigate the impacts of various design decisions related to ventilation system design and building material selection, and to assess the indoor air quality performance of an existing building.  Predicted contaminant concentrations can help estimate personal exposure based on occupancy patterns in the building.  Comparison of exposure estimates for different assumptions of ventilation rates and source strengths is possible.  To learn more about CONTAMW, visit the NIST website at http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/ IAQanalysis/CONTAMWdesc.htm  Submission of Responses: Sources may respond with conversion solutions from existing formats to IFC, IFC output files to the zonal model file, or both.  In all cases, sources must describe how their technology or technique will improve the current process to convert existing hard and soft formats into the IFC 2x model architecture format and/or to convert the IFC format to the specified project zonal model file.  Sources shall identify any experience in performing the conversion processes described by the paper submitted for this requirement.  Submissions in response to this announcement shall a white paper of no more than 10 pages (excluding cover page).  Papers shall be unclassified.  Sources shall clearly identify all proprietary portions of the paper and NSWCDD will treat these in the strictest confidence.  NSWCDD will accept papers from date  of issuance for this announcement through 30 April 2003.  Sources may submit papers any time during this period; however, an initial review of papers will start 30 days after issuance of this announcement.  Submit papers to sd13@nswc.navy.mil.  The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of papers submitted for this sources sought advertisement.  This announcement will be available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nswc.navy.mil/supply. All submissions must reference Solicitation Number N00178-03-Q-3009 and provide the Offeror's name/address/point of contact/phone number/email address.

<DESC>This serves as a sources sought notice and market survey to locate qualified businesses capable of designing, manufacturing, installing, and monitoring the performance of a green roof for a pilot project to be undertaken by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) at its Main Interior Building in Washington, D.C.  The project scope includes the installation of an extensive (low profile) green roof on one-half of a seventh floor wing at the Main Interior Building (MIB), 1849 C St., NW, Washington, DC.  This project is intended as a pilot scale installation (approximately 5,000 S.F.) to evaluate the environmental benefits, and the installation and maintenance requirements to consider further the cost and desirability of expanding installation to as much of the 113,741 S.F. of MIB flat roof space, as appropriate. The existing roof is an Inverted Roof Membrane Assembly as manufactured by the Barrett Company.  Installed in 1992, the membrane is a Ram Tough 250 rubberized asphalt adhered to the structural concrete deck.  A 2 inch thick rock ballast over rigid insulation and a protection course comprise the field interlocking pedestrian pavers form the perimeter.  The project must follow approved rubberized asphalt manufactures recommendations, including but not limited to the addition of a 125 mils of rubberized asphalt topcoat and root barrier, in order that the proposed Manufacture will issue a new 15-year material and workmanship warranty.  As part of the design, construction and post-construction phases of work, DOI is interested in environmental performance monitoring of this pilot installation, particularly comparing the instrumented performance of the installed green roof against a control roof.   One of the significant attributes to be assessed is the ability of the green roof to diminish runoff of storm water from the roof surface, particularly during peak storm events.  Comparisons with the control roof are to be made to quantify and extrapolate the potential impact of green roof installations on regional storm sewer capacity problems.  As part of this project, DOI may be seeking to contract for design of the monitoring program measuring and reporting on key environmental elements such as precipitation, temperature, humidity, soil moisture and precipitation runoff, including specification of appropriate instrumentation; identification of data capture devices and protocols; recommended monitoring routines; quality assurance and control measures, data evaluation protocols; and recommended analysis and report products, as well as implementation of the Environmental Performance Monitoring Plan under the auspices of a qualified, registered hydrologist.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation and no solicitation package exists at this time. The Government is not requesting technical proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this sources sought notice. Your responses will be used solely for market research purposes of the Government. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender. If a solicitation is later released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this cite for the release of any synopsis or solicitation. Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statement, experience and sample. Responses should also include the following: name and address of firm; name and telephone number of contact person; size of business; number of years in business. Responses may be submitted by e-mail to annabelle.contee@gsa.gov; or by mail to at Annabelle Contee, Contract Specialist, GSA, Property Development Division (WPC), 7th & D Streets, SW, Room 2002, Washington, DC  20407.  [Phone:  (202)205-0165].  The information requested is due by 3:30 PM, (EST) local time on February 27, 2003.

The BEP website is a highly visible public site which attracts approximately 5 million ?hits? each month.  In Fiscal Year 2002 the Bureau?s sales executed over the Internet amounted to $1.5 million, or 23% of its total sales to the public.  The contractor must be able to support these baseline volumes with acceptable performance rates and be able to sustain 10% annual growth rates.  

The BEP web site at moneyfactory.com is currently serviced by load balanced web servers and database servers.   Traffic is received through an external firewall appliance running a Checkpoint firewall, then passed to a load balancing switch within the web tier which distributes traffic to a number of web servers within a web server array.  The web servers communicate to the database servers on a non public network and through another firewall.  These are serviced by services at various layers, which include intrusion detection, web reporting, and backup/recovery services.  All production components are hosted on at a commercial web hosting facility, connected to the Internet via a one 10 Mb/s connection, and monitored 24x7.  Development and monitoring are performed over a separate network at a development contractor?s facility with communication via secure access provided by Virtual Private Network (VPN).

Web server component configuration includes:  Microsoft Windows 2000 Server (SP3), Sun Web Server 6.0, and Macromedia ColdFusion 5.0 Enterprise Edition. The database server components include Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server (SP3) and Microsoft SQL Server 2000 SP2.  Both web and database servers utilize a dual processor and RAID disk array architecture.  Log reports are provided via WebTrends.

Although content management is provided via a proprietary tool, it is licensed to the Bureau and available for use in the future hosting environment.  Alternatives may also be explored for transitioning to an industry-recognized commercial off the shelf tool.

As a discrete system within the BEP?s Public Sales Program, the public internet site will interoperate with other components of the Public Sales System including:  the secure portion of BEP?s Web site provided by the United States Department of the Treasury?s Financial Management System(FMS)(https://secure.bep.treas.gov/); and, the SAP R/3 Sales and Distribution System.  The Internet site will process transactions via a secure server provided by the U.S.  Department of the Treasury?s Financial Management Service (FMS), using that Service?s Internet Credit Card Collections (IC3) system.  It is on this FMS-hosted transacting site (https://secure.bep.treas.gov/), that users enter their billing, shipping and account (including credit card) information.

The contractor will have a two month ramp-up period (beginning from the time the contract becomes effective) before deployment in the live production environment.  During this two month period, the incumbent contractor will continue to provide hosting services.  Therefore, the necessary testing and development needed in order to provide the effective and orderly transfer of all existing site functions (including backend, eCommerce, FMS, SAP integration) must be complete and ready for operation at this time.  This is necessary due to contractual limitations of the existing contract.

<SUBJECT>R -- TICKET TO HIRE CALL CENTER OPERATIONS
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with ACS Federal Health Care, Inc. for the continuation of the TICKET TO HIRE Call Center operations which provides services to employers, Employment Networks (EN's) and the State Vocational Rehabilitation agencies (SVRA's) related to the Ticket to Work Program and and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-170).  The TICKET TO HIRE program allows for the connection of Social Security Administration (SSA) disabled beneficiaries (Ticket Participants) through their ENs or SVRAs to employers.  TICKET TO HIRE is a free national employer referral service designed to link employers to ENs and SVRAs that have qualified Ticket participants and other Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries.  Outreach to employers is essential in order for the Ticket to Work program to increase the opportunities for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries to obtain employment.  One of the key factors to ensure successful job placements for Ticket to Work participants and other SSDI and SSI beneficiaries is to gain employer participation.  The TICKET TO HIRE is a viable tool that helps with this process by providing resources and solutions within the full range of disability employment issues, minimizing barriers, and serving as a one-stop place for employers to recruit, hire and retain qualified workers with disabilities.  TICKET TO HIRE staff will keep track of hires and other outcomes related to Ticket to Work participants and other SSDI and SSI beneficiaries who utilize their service.  The staff will collect and analyze data and administer surveys to track and report EN activity and beneficiary hires.  SSA is currently receiving these services through an InterAgency Agreement (IAA) with the Department of Labor (DOL).  DOL provides SSA with these services through a contract with ACS Federal Health Care, Inc.  Due to the escalation of contacts made to the TICKET TO HIRE Call Center, a contract is required to handle the increased workload for the remainder of the fiscal year.  The estimated period of performance for this requirement will be from March 1, 2003 through September 30, 2003.  ACS Federal Health Care, Inc. is the only organization uniquely qualified to implement all the tasks required under this contract because it has created and implemented a call center that services employers through DOL's Employer Assistance Referral Network (EARN).  The TICKET TO HIRE is SSA's specialized unit of EARN in support of the Ticket to Work Program.  The IAA established the TICKET TO HIRE Call Center Operations to provide the services to employers seeking qualified Ticket to Work candidates.  ACS Federal Health Care, Inc. has the unique capability to provide these services because they are the only source that has created a customized infrastructure and database for these services at this time.  SSA knows of no other source that has the capability to satisfy all of the requirements for this contract.  Interested parties that believe they have the capability to perform the services required should submit a capability statement to Barbara F. Hands by mail to: SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, 1710 GWYNN OAK AVENUE, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND 21207; by email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov or by fax to 410-966-9310.  All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENT - TICKET TO HIRE CALL CENTER SERVICES, and shall be received no later than 3:00 p.m. (EST) FEBRUARY 3, 2003.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date above, the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with ACS Federal Health Care, Inc.  All questions must be submitted in writing to the mailing address or email address listed above and marked to the attention of Barbara F. Hands. Telephone calls will not be accepted.
