<SUBJECT>99--The Role of Human Factors in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
<SOLNBR>3660
<RESPDATE>060704
<ARCHDATE>07072004
<CONTACT>Elayne Gomes-Battle, 202 267-3610
<DESC>Title:	The Role of Human Factors in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for research and development of products that will be used to assist FAA flight standards and air traffic in developing policies, procedures, and approval processes to enable operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in the National Air Space (NAS). Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), or a more appropriate term, Unmanned Aircraft (UA) is an aircraft without an onboard pilot.  The military has used unmanned aircraft for several decades with various levels of success.  More recently, there has been an increase in demand for non-military unmanned aircraft operations.  Within the last couple years, commercial unmanned aircraft operations have concentrated on surveillance and advertisement, but several companies have expressed an interest in using unmanned aircraft for long distance cargo transportation.  Aviation analysts state that unmanned aircraft operations will transform the aviation industry and the recent proliferation of requests to use unmanned aircraft in the national air space is not a fad.  Although unmanned aircraft refers to man-out-of-the-loop operation, the human operator is still a critical element in the success of an unmanned aircraft operation.  Not surprisingly, the largest contributing factor for unmanned aircraft mishaps is human error.  The unmanned aircraft will not have a pilot onboard, but there will be an operator monitoring the flight through airspace, a technician maintaining the aircraft and remote station, and the interaction of the unmanned aircraft with manned aircraft.  In order for unmanned aircraft to be integrated in the national air space within five years (Flight Plan 2004-2008), the must understand the human factors issues of unmanned aircraft to ensure that safe operations occur in the national air space. The purpose of this announcement is to survey the market for other available sources with the capabilities, resources and qualifications to provide research and development services to support three mutually exclusive tasks: (1) unmanned aircraft operator qualification and training requirement, (2) maintenance considerations of unmanned aircraft requirement, and (3) air traffic control considerations of unmanned aircraft requirement.  A description of each task requirement is below: Unmanned Aircraft Operator Qualification and Training Requirement: The General Aviation and Commercial Aviation Division needs human factors guidance to assist in the decision of who will operate UAVs and what type of training requirements these operators need.  Research may investigate: Â·	the effects of operator performance by different types of console display interfaces; how UAV flight mission profiles affect operator workload, vigilance, fatigue, and piloting performance;  Â·	determine whether prior flight experience is important to operate a UAV; Â·	determine whether new opportunities present themselves in terms of the inclusion of persons with handicaps that were previously excluded from piloting aircraft but would not have difficulty with UA;  Â·	and investigate medical and physiological standards are required to operate a UAV.  Final report will specifies operator training and qualification requirements related to the operation of UAVs within the NAS. Maintenance Considerations of Unmanned Aircraft Requirement: A report that compares and contrasts current general aviation maintenance facilities and operations to the proposed unmanned aircraft maintenance facilities operations.  The report will emphasize human factors issues such as: Â·	maintenance technician qualifications and training requirements for various types of unmanned aircraft; Â·	compare and contrast maintenance technicians on the job requirements to perform a maintenance task between an aircraft and unmanned aircraft; Â·	identify types of knowledge and skills required by a maintenance technician to certify that an unmanned aircraft is safe to fly; Â·	 identify unmanned aircraft maintenance tasks that are unique to aircraft maintenance; Â·	compare and contrast type of resources required by aircraft maintenance facilities and unmanned aircraft maintenance facilities; Â·	identify who would be a typical unmanned aircraft maintenance facility; Â·	and what type of human factors training would be required to maintain unmanned aircraft. Air Traffic Control Considerations of Unmanned Aircraft Requirement:  The introduction of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) into the NAS by commercial interests, as well as increased use by DOD and other government agencies, will generate a host of human factors issues associated with the management of airspace and the conduct of air traffic control (ATC) tasks.  Air traffic controllers may need to interact with the operators of these vehicles under various circumstances and will need to be able to understand and predict UAV behavior to maintain separation and manage various classes of airspace.  How controllers will interact with UAVs and how they will affect the controller's workload, situation awareness and ability to maintain a focus on airspace management is unknown.  The FAA needs to identify the human factors issues and address them so that the introduction of UAVs can be accomplished in a reasonable manner.  The intent of this effort is to identify these issues and generate alternative approaches to resolve them through human factors research at a later time.  This research effort will culminate in a technical report that identifies human factors issues associated with the operation of UAVs in the controlled airspace of the NAS. The main product of this research effort will be a report that systematically identifies and analyzes the human factors issues associated with the increased frequency of UAV use in the NAS.  It is expected that there will be a strong analytical component grounded in operational concerns that may emerge.  At a minimum, the analysis should address the impact of UAV operations on ATC information processing, communication, display requirements, control and data input tasks, and the impact on controller ability to manage a mix of traffic (UAV and conventional aircraft) and perform their primary tasks. Government laboratories, university institutions, or contractors are eligible to compete for this project and may submit a capability/qualification statement for one or more tasks.  The capability/qualification statement must address the following qualification statements. 1.	Demonstrate knowledge in unmanned aerial vehicles. 2.	If institution intends to submit a capability/qualification statement for the Unmanned Aircraft Operator Qualification and Training Requirement task, please submit demonstrated knowledge in selection and training, interface design, information management, performance assessment, workload, medical human factors.  Include work pertaining to unmanned aerial vehicles. 3.	If institution intends to submit a capability/qualification statement for the Maintenance Considerations of Unmanned Aircraft Requirement task, please submit demonstrated knowledge in aircraft maintenance human factors.  Include work pertaining to unmanned aerial vehicles. 4.	If institution intends to submit a capability/qualification statement for the Air Traffic Control Considerations of Unmanned Aircraft Requirement task, please submit demonstrated knowledge in air traffic control human factors.  Include work pertaining to unmanned aerial vehicles. 5.	Ability to coordinate, manage, and collect human factors data. 6.	An operator who has logged unmanned aerial vehicle flight time. 7.	Demonstrate knowledge of the FAA air traffic control, flight standards and certification processes. 8.	List collaborative experiences with FAA, NASA, Department of Defense, and other research facilities. 9.	List any currently funded UAV research project(s).  State funding organization, amount, brief description of project, and how the project(s) may leverage proposed work. 10.	Submit resume with a list publications along with representative sample of reprints pertaining to UAV research. A total period of performance of 24 months, including options, if any, is planned. The total estimated value is more than $100,000. If you are interested in being considered for award of this requirement, provide a written qualification statement (not to exceed 5 pages) documenting each of the requirements listed above including references.  If this survey results in a competitive acquisition, the competition will be limited to those vendors who responded to this survey and were evaluated and determined to be qualified for all factors. Mail or deliver two copies of the qualification statement to Elayne Gomes-Battle, ASU 340, FAA, 800 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20591.  The due date is prior to 4 pm Eastern Time on 2 July 2004.  The FAA will not pay for any effort expended with respect to the responses.

<DESC>NA This proposed procurement is Unrestricted.  SIC is 1542 and the NAICS is 236220.  The solicitation for the Expansion of the National Defense University located at Fort McNair in Washington, DC is being advertised as a Two Step Request for Proposal (RFP). This work under this project is required in order to provide an adequate academic facility to accommodate the consolidation of various functional elements of NDU.  This RFP requires separate technical, design and price proposals, which are to be submitted in  separate phases, and are to be evaluated on a Best Value basis for award of the project.   The project description and overall performance requirements for this requirement will be included in the solicitation package.  The design and construction criteria for this project will be included in Phase II of this solicitation, which will be furnishe d by an amendment.  The evaluation of the proposals will consist of two (2) Phases.  In Phase I of the solicitation process, offerors are to submit a technical qualification proposal only, without extensive design information and without a price proposal.  The full Quality/Technical Proposal (technical-design and performance capability) will be required in Phase II, after the initial short list of the most highly qualified firms has been established.  The “short list” will be limited to a maximum of five (5 ) offerors.  During Phase I, the Government will only evaluate the relative capabilities, and past performance of the competing firms.  Offerors should submit technical qualification proposals that are acceptable without any need for additional explanation  of information.  The Government may make a final determination regarding a technical proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the proposal as submitted.  The Government may proceed with the second phase without requesting further information from a ny offeror, however the Government may request additional information from offerors of proposals that are considered reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  A “Notice of Unacceptability” will be forward  to offerors upon completion of the Phase I evaluation whose technical proposals were determined to be unacceptable.  In Phase II, only those offerors who are short-listed will be allowed to design and price proposals. The evaluation in Phase II will be of  the offeror’s design and price proposal.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Large business firms that are selected to continue onto Phase II are required to submit a subcontracting plan at the time for receipt of their price proposals.  The fo llowing subcontracting dollar goals pertain only to the dollar value of the contract that is subcontracted.  60% of the subcontracted dollar value shall be for small businesses, of that 60%, 20% shall be for Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), 10% shall be for Women Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), 3% shall be for HUB Zone Small Businesses (HUBZ), 3% shall be for Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and 3% shall be for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  In order to comply with the D ebt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for award of a Federal contract.  The initial registration date expired 31 May 1998.  For information regarding future registration, contact (1) CCR Web site at http://www.acq.osd.mil/ec; (2) dial up modem at (614) 692-6788 (User ID: ccrpub and Password: pub2ccri); (3) through any DoD Certified Value Added Network.  To review the database, the web site is: http://www.fedec navigator.disa.mil.  Additionally a paper form for registration may be obtained from the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.  It is imperative that all small disadvantaged businesses contact their cognizant Small Business Administ ration Office to o btain Small Disadvantaged Business Certification.  Without SBA SDB certification a prime contractor, nor a federal agency, can receive SDB credit when utilizing non-certified SDB contractors/subcontractors.  The Phase I potion of this solicitation will be provided in an electronic format, free of charge, to all registered plan holders.  The Phase I portion of this solicitation will not be issued in paper.  Contractor’s requests for solicitations will be performed through ASFI.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to issue an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract on a sole source basis to the West Virginia Water Research Institute (WV-WRI), a division of West Virginia University (WVU).  The purpose of the acquisition is in situ application of advanced environmental pollutant remediation and treatment technologies at U.S. sites based on the Well Injection Depth Extraction (WIDE) system.  The proposed contract action is in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. WIDE is a liquid and air injection extraction system and is capable of maximizing contaminant plume material removal by targeting plume boundary and depth extents.  WV-WRI personnel have successfully demonstrated the WIDE remediation technology in a pilot feasibility test in 2001 and received Ohio state EPA approval.  No other technologies are known to have received similar permitting approvals.  Conventional pump-and-treat (single point source groundwater wells) have been determined to be unacceptable for this requirement due to the length of time required for effectiveness of treatment. Please note this is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP) but rather a notice of DOE NETL's intent to issue a sole source award to WVU WV-WRI. Numbered note 22 applies.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) in a negotiated procurement for the preservation of photographs created by the Bureau of Reclamation between the early 1900’s and 1979, and processed under Record Group 115 at NARA, Rocky Mountain Region, Denver Federal Center, Bldg. 48, Denver, CO. These photographs document the construction of the great dams and irrigation projects of the west. They show areas before reclamation work was done, views of project work and structures, changes in rural and urban areas after completion of projects, visitors to the projects, and project dedications. The records currently get low to medium use by researchers, but this is directly related to the shear volume of records. The records are generally arranged according to the Bureau of Reclamation Region in which the photos were taken, the shelf lists (arranged by region), and then by accession. The Contractor must provide all management, supervision, and personnel necessary to perform archival preservation of photographic holdings. The contract awarded as a result of this RFQ will be a Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Time and Materials contract with Department of Labor wage determinations incorporated, as necessary. The Term of the contract will be for a Base Period of twelve (12) months plus four (4) twelve (12) month Option Periods. The requirement is a 100% small business set-aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 519120 and the Small Business Size Standard is $6 million. All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by NARA. Copies of the RFQ, which will be available on or about June 11, 2004, may be obtained through the Federal Business Opportunities web site at www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is announcing the release of the Measurements, Modeling, and Analyses in support of AURA and other NASA Satellite Observations of the Earth's Atmosphere solicitation.  With the planned launch of the Aura spacecraft in mid-CY 2004, NASA will be providing the research community with significant new capability that will provide products of use to a broad range of policy and decision-makers, including NASA's domestic and international partners.	 The full range of Aura's capability may be found on the EOS Project Science web site: http://eos-aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/	 New capabilities include: o  First global measurements of the vertical profiles of tropospheric ozone and several key precursors  o  Global measurements of column amounts of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and other constituents that can be used to assess tropospheric and stratospheric composition o  Highest horizontal resolution global measurements of vertical profiles of ozone, water vapor, and related chemical constituents in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere o  First-ever global observation of profiles of several important trace gases in the stratosphere, most notably the hydroxyl radical  o A comprehensive measurement of aerosol and cloud properties making use of a combination of wavelengths not available on any other space-based platform It is the NASA Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) view that one of the most important contributions of the Aura Mission to Earth System Science will come from the synergistic use of satellite observations, sub-orbital observations, and models that can assure the accuracy of the new Aura observations, provide ways of looking at atmospheric composition not possible with suborbital data alone. This combination of assets will synthesize Aura observations into data sets for scientific research and use by others for policy and/or decision-making. The goals of this research are to answer key science questions: · How is atmospheric composition changing?  · What trends in atmospheric constituents and solar radiation are driving global climate? · How do atmospheric trace constituents respond to and affect global environmental change? · What are the effects of global atmospheric chemical and climate changes on regional air quality? · How will future changes in atmospheric composition affect ozone, climate, and global air quality? Investigations in the following categories are being solicited: A) Validation of Aura observations  B) Extension of Aura observations  C) Models that use, predict, and/or assimilate Aura observations  D) Laboratory and related theoretical observations that are needed to improve the accuracy of Aura retrievals.  E) Investigations that will contribute to measurements, modeling, and data analysis research supported under the Earth Science Enterprise's Atmospheric Composition Focus Area.  The solicitation will be available electronically on the release date, via the Internet at the Research Opportunities Web Page at http://research.nasa.gov under "Office of Earth Science (Code Y)". A paper copy will be available to those who do not have access to Internet by calling (202) 358-3552 and leaving a voice mail message.  The following dates apply to this announcement: Notice of Intent Due:  July 16, 2004 Proposals Due: For the INTEX-B component of the Aura Validation:  Sept. 30, 2004 All other proposals will be due on August 30, 2004 POC:   Dr. Philip L.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for: Employ numerical simulations to investigate laminar-turbulent transition in a three-dimensional supersonic flow.  Specifically, purchase services to enhance, apply, and transfer (non-commercial) transition simulation capability developed by Prof. Chaoqun Liu and Dr. Li Jiang from the Mathematics Department at the University of Texas at Arlington.  This capability has been developed and exercised under AFOSR Research Grants F49620-01-1-0028, F49620-00-1-0220, F49620-99-1-0042, F49620-97-1-0033, F49620-95-1-0018, and F49620-96-1-0122, plus prior NASA Langley contracts	NAS1-19016, NAS1-19312 under the small business innovative research (SBIR) program; and NASA Langley purchase requests RBC-1086, RBC-1193, and RBC-1209, which total to approximately $2.5 million.    1.1	BACKGROUND: The enhanced software will support the development of improved prediction techniques for laminar-turbulent transition in boundary-layer flows.  The latter need is addressed under the Efficient Airframe Systems and Integration (EASI) program of the Aerospace Vehicle Systems and Technology Program Office via the subelement on Transition Physics and Modeling.  Transition prediction is also an important element of the Supersonic Vehicle Technology program.  Numerical database generated with the simulation code developed under this contract will provide detailed physical insights into the flow behavior during transition; suggest potential simplifications towards the development of engineering models for underlying flow phenomena, provide a posteriori verification for such models; or help design and interpret relevant experiments.    2.0	CONTRACTOR’S TASK REQUIREMENTS: This effort represents a follow on to prior work in which the contractor had developed a high-order, compressible, parallelized Navier-Stokes flow solver that is applicable to flows with shocks and applied it for simulations of linear and nonlinear instability wave propagation and roughness-induced receptivity phenomena in subsonic and supersonic boundary-layer flows.	The accuracy of simulating the propagation of instability waves had been cross-validated for both two- and three-dimensional boundary-layer flows against predictions based on a reliable Parabolized Stability Equation (PSE) solver, NASA’s Langley Stability and Transition Analysis Code (LASTRAC).  It is also expected that that the solver includes previously developed pre- and post-processing capabilities to facilitate easy interfacing with the LASTRAC code for the desired range of problems. The Contractor shall refine and exercise the above Navier-Stokes solver by performing the following additional tasks: 1. Implement/refine and evaluate a subgrid scale (SGS) model, preferably based on approximate defiltering of the resolved scales of motion, for large eddy simulation of a high-speed (M &gt; 1) transitional/turbulent boundary layer.  Perform direct and large eddy simulations of a canonical, two-dimensional boundary layer to provide detailed assessment of the accuracy and efficiency of the SGS model within transitional or turbulent regions of the flow field.  The post-processing will include detailed information about first- and second-order single point statistics, as well as two-point correlations and/or frequency and wave-number spectra and kinetic energy budgets.  To facilitate the extension of the simulation code to more realistic geometries, the contractor will also perform a preliminary investigation into suitable options to improve the efficiency of computing mean-flow solutions using the current solver. The Contractor shall transfer the simulation capability (along with the results of the simulation) to NASA by providing necessary assistance to ensure that the code can be implemented and run on NASA’s Linux clusters.  NASA will provide partial computational facilities towards this simulation by providing up to 5000 node cpu hours on an in-house PC cluster.  The geometry of the configuration(s) will preferably model a configuration that has previously been used in an experiment/computation and/or represents a canonical flow field of wide interest.   2. As necessary, provide required technical assistance towards transition calculations to be carried out by researchers at NASA Langley Research Center.	The Contractor will assist by providing a code(s) that is accurate and robust enough for a calculation pertaining to one or more stages of transition; provide guidance with appropriate use of the code; help set up the computational grid(s); as necessary, assist with troubleshooting during the simulation and with analyzing the data during and after the simulation (so as to provide useful physical insights towards the development and validation of lower fidelity models of the transition processes).    Option effort: 3. This task is similar to Task 1 above.  If, under the base effort, the SGS model is found to be satisfactory for the simulation of transitional flows, then the contractor shall extend the large eddy simulations to crossflow induced transition in a three-dimensional boundary-layer flow.	Otherwise, direct numerical simulations will be used to capture a significant portion of the transitional region.  Again, the geometry of the selected configuration should model a flow geometry/conditions that has been (or is likely to be used) in an experiment or computation and/or represents a canonical flow.  It is also desirable for the selected flow configuration to provide further insights into the feasibility/efficacy of one or more of the laminar flow control techniques of interest for next generation supersonic aircraft. 4. The contractor shall also provide required technical assistance to transfer the added simulation capability to NASA Langley Research Center as outlined in the context of tasks 1 and 2 above. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from the University of Texas at Arlington.  NASA LaRC has pioneered a number of innovations in transition simulation during the early nineties.  Due to a steady decline in funding during late nineties, however, much of this capability has eroded not only at LaRC, but over U.S. as a whole.  In this respect, Prof. Liu and Dr. Jiang’s research has been rather unique in terms of having remained active in transition simulation research throughout these years, having demonstrated the capability to simulate the different stages of boundary-layer transition process over both simple and airfoil geometries as well as across a wide range of speeds (incompressible, subsonic and supersonic) and, finally, having developed simulation code(s) that are amenable to efficient execution in a parallel environment.	 There exist one or two other research groups that have a similar capability in some respects. To the best of our knowledge, however, they do not possess a comprehensive, demonstrated capability for three-dimensional flows with crossflow instabilities; shock capturing in supersonic flows; and, most importantly, established accuracy against and crosstalk with NASA’s LASTRAC code.  This functionality, which is essential for the tasks outlined in the statement of work, has been described in recent publications and reports by Prof. Liu, Dr. Jiang and their collaborators. Thus, we believe that only University of Texas would be in a position to meet the stated requirements, especially within the limited duration of the period of performance (twelve months from contract turn-on).  The Authority for Other Than Full and Open  Competition is 6.302-1. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 14, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SUBJECT>A--OPTIMIZING A HONEYCOMB SANDWICH COMPOSITE PANEL FOR INCREASED TRANSMISSION LOSS
<SOLNBR>NNL04060301Q
<RESPDATE>061404

<DESC>PROBLEM STATEMENT A graphite-epoxy Nomex honeycomb panel exhibits low transmission loss due to its lightweight and high stiffness.  The primary contributor to the poor transmission loss characteristics is the supersonic speed of the panel's shear wave with an associated low critical frequency typically in the hundreds of Hertz.	The honeycomb sandwich panel is an efficient radiator. An open question is whether the transmission loss of a honeycomb panel can be increased without sacrificing its structural integrity.  Stated another way, can the honeycomb panel constituent components or archetecture be modified to achieve lower wave speeds while maintaining load bearing and fatigue characteristics?   TASK STATEMENT NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a detailed finite element model of a honeycomb panel that is able to predict the panel's transmission loss dependence on the properties of the panel's constituent materials and methods of fabrication.  The model shall be built and analyzed using the STARS analysis capability developed by the Naval Research Laboratory for NASA.  The baseline panel shall be composed of aluminum core with aluminum face sheets so that transmission loss figures can be compared to physical models already built and tested by NASA.  Small scale panels and/or beams may have to be modeled to aid the verification effort.  Once verified, the panel model will be used to search the multi-dimensional design space, and to determine the model parameters' effect on transmission loss.  If a positive dependency is found, an optimal design(s) shall be defined such that a physical test model can be built.  As appropriate, Modern Design of Experiment techniques will be adapted to define the models and measurements for numerical and/or experimental tests. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Metron, Inc., the only known source capable of performing this research and development effort.  Metron, Inc. has unique experience in constructing and analyzing models using the STARS analysis system that was developed by the Naval Research Laboratory for NASA.  Metron, Inc. has been used exclusively by the Naval Research Laboratory to develop and run the STARS software.  Thus, Metron, Inc. is the only known entity that can operate this software.  The Authority For Other Than Full and Open Competition is 6.302-1. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 14, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

This three day residential program shall help to expand participants beyond their current capabilities, fosters a new sense of trust and interaction with their peers, and seeks to challenge personal and organizational assumptions with regard to implementing change at both levels.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Environment, has a requirement to establish a long-term business relationship for the purpose of improving and sustaining military family housing communities at the following installations:  F ort Knox, Kentucky; Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; and Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.  Collectively, these projects are known as the Central Group.  This requirement will be satisfied through the Army Housing privatization program known as the Residential Communiti es Initiative (RCI).  RCI operates as part of the Congressionally authorized Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) (10 USC 2871).  RCI employs best commercial practices in management, development, construction, maintenance and operation to meet the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s long-term needs for military family housing.  The Army will award one contract for the Fort Knox project, one contract for Fort Leavenworth project, and one contract for the Redstone Arsenal project.  The Army may also include Fort Riley, K S as a stand-alone project or in combination with another Central project.  The selected offerors will work with the Army to create a Community Development and Management Plan (CDMP) that will describe a 50-year plan to develop, re-develop, construct, main tain and operate the housing assets at each of the particular Central Group projects.  The Army will solicit this requirement on an unrestricted basis using a Request for Qualifications (RFQ).  The Army intends to publish the Central Group RFQ on or about June 11, 2004.  At Step One, the RFQ will seek, from interested offerors, a five-page submission addressing three Minimum Experience Requirements (MERs).  The closing date for receipt of MER submissions will be on or about June 25, 2004.  Upon conclusion o f the evaluation of the MERs, those offerors who have satisfied the MERs shall be eligible to further compete for the Central Group by submitting a complete Statement of Qualifications (SOQ).  Offerors will be provided a minimum of 30 calendar days to prov ide their SOQ submissions.  The Army recognizes that its RCI solicitations include a Step One selection process that remains fairly constant.  Providing a mechanism to allowing certain previously qualified offerors to avoid submitting duplicative documenta tion for Step One can enhance Offeror and Army efficiency.  Current potential Offerors who have qualified for inclusion in the competitive range in any prior Army RCI solicitation, and whose composition of principal members includes the same principal memb ers (with the same responsibilities) since inclusion within that competitive range or award, may request a waiver of the requirement to submit MERs and Step One and be automatically eligible to compete on Step Two of this solicitation.  Instructions for re questing a waiver will be provided in the RFQ.  The Army, in its sole discretion, will determine whether the offeror fulfills the waiver requirements.  Offerors not qualifying for a waiver will be asked to submit Step One information in accordance with the  RFQ.  The Central Group RFQ and amendments will be available at the Army RCI web page at http://rci.army.mil.  Selecting the Central RFQ button from the Army RCI web page will allow offerors to view and download the RFQ and amendments.  Prospective offero rs will be requested to register. Registered offerors will receive electronic notification when amendments are posted to the web page.  The Army will only respond to questions about the RFQ if they are received by electronic or facsimile medium.  The Army will not reply to any question submitted later than 10 days prior to a submission deadline.  All comments or questions by e-mail should be directed to tracy.fetchik@usace.army.mil.  If by facsimile, comments or questions should be directed to Tracy Fetchik  at (301) 677-3005.  Army responses to questions will be issued in the form of an amendment to the RFQ and can be found at http://rci.army.mil.

<DESC>MODIFICATION 0002.  The purpose of this modification is to answer questions received from offerors.  The following clauses are being added:  1252.215-70 KEY PERSONNEL AND/OR FACILITIES and ADDENDUM TO TAR CLAUSE 1252.215-70 – KEY PERSONNEL AND/OR FACILITIES.  The Coast Guard will not accept any more questions after January 20, 2004. 

1.  QUESTION:  Please clarify that the maximum order is 35 workshops per year not 35 workshops over the life of the contract. 

ANSWER:  The maximum order quantity is 35 per year.

2.  QUESTION:  As a company that frequently performs workshops on military bases, including Coast Guard bases, it is our experience that laptops and LED projectors are usually provided by the base.  Using equipment already available on base could significantly help reduce the cost of this contract as LED projectors and laptops are expensive to purchase or lease.  Would Coast Guard entertain allowing the contractor to request permission to use base equipment?    

ANSWER:  The Contractor is responsible for providing their own laptop and LED.  Many of our classes are not done in facilities that provide and are setup for this type of seminar or offer this equipment.

3.  QUESTION:  Should the Cost Proposal and Technical Proposal be packaged separately or bound together? 

ANSWER:  Bound together.  Provide a total of 3 copies (1 original and 2 copies).  Volume I – Technical Proposal.  Volume II – Past Performance Information, Volume III – Cost Proposal.  The offeror must number the pages, and bind each set of Technical proposals, Past Performance and Price Proposals in a three-ring loose-leaf binder.  Submit resumes in each copy of Volume I under a tab divider.  

4.  QUESTION:  Are the lactations listed in the synopsis the only locations where workshops will be held? 

ANSWER:  No.  Coast Guard Transition Managers are responsible for regional areas.  We listed a few of the more predominant areas based on past history.  Other areas may include but are not limited to Seattle, WA, San Diego, CA, and areas of Texas.
  
5.  QUESTION:  I see that this is a 100% small business set-aside.  Are partnerships ok?  Or a prime/sub relationship?  Are there any requirements for other DBE like a native-American owned company?

ANSWER:  The Coast Guard has no restrictions.  In accordance with Clause 52.219-14 – Limitations on Subcontracting, states for services at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.  

6.  QUESTION:  Is this a new requirement? 

ANSWER:  No, this is not a new requirement.

7.  QUESTION:  Is there an incumbent?  If so, who, and are they eligible to rebid? 

ANSWER:  Yes.  The incumbent contractors were Westward Systems, Inc., The Ryan Group, Inc., and Native American Management Services, Inc.  Yes, the incumbent contractors are eligible to rebid.

8.  QUESTION:  What is the maximum number of participants for each class A and class B sessions? 

ANSWER:  Attendance is an unknown factor.  Seminars are based on several factors such as number of military members separating, location, and operational commitments to name a few.

9.  QUESTION:  What is the total dollar amount the USCG has spent for these seminars in the past?

ANSWER:  The dollar amount is $677,435.97 over a five year period.   

10.  QUESTION:  How did the USCG arrive at the annual travel amount? 

ANSWER:  Travel was based upon past history in combination with the JTR.  Basic formulation used was:  maximum number of yearly seminars, destinations, times the daily per diem rates in accordance with the JTR.

11.  QUESTION:  To ensure that each technical proposal is evaluated fairly, what criteria will USCG use to rate the technical proposals? 

ANSWER:  The evaluation criteria are described in the combined synopsis/solicitation dated December 23, 2003.

12.  QUESTION:  Will USCG consider extending the due date since this notice was posted during the Christmas holidays? 

ANSWER:  Yes.  Proposals must be received by 2:00 PM EDT on January 23, 2004. 

13.  QUESTION:  Can you specify to what extent the contractor will be expected to cover Item #15, FINANCES, under the Preseparation Counseling Checklist, DD Form 2648? 

ANSWER:  Cover an overview of what members should be aware of when retiring, or separating from the military.

14.  QUESTION:  How many Seminar A and Seminar B sessions have been conducted at each location? 

ANSWER:  The number of seminars varies from year to year.  Listed are the number of A and B sessions conducted over the past five years:  Washington, DC (Seminar A – 2, Seminar B - 1), Boston, MA (Seminar A - 2), Miami, FL (Seminar A - 11), Alameda, CA (Seminar A - 31), Kodiak, AK (Seminar A - 12), New Orleans, LA (Seminar A - 3), Seattle, WA, (Seminar A - 9), Texas (Seminar  A - 4).

15.  QUESTION:  Please estimate the total number of spouses you anticipate attending, and clarify whether you want instructional material provided for them individually or do you see them sharing materials with their spouses.

ANSWER:  Spouses are encouraged and welcome to attend.  Those that do attend encompass approximately 10%.  Instructional material is expected to be provided for them as well.      

16.  QUESTION:  Since the travel expenses are not to exceed the limitations quoted, how do you suggest dealing with those expenses should the number of seminars ordered goes beyond the minimum quantity of 10?  Simply stated, if we are to assume that two instructors are on the road for 5 days for each program, our normal per diems and travel expense will exceed the limits well before the maximum of 35 was reached.  Since your office controls the number of programs to be conducted we would prefer clarification on this matter.

ANSWER:  It is our recommendation that the offeror review the JTR for further reference and Per Diem.  Government travel expenses will not exceed the threshold of 10 classes with 2 instructors within a five-day period.

17.  QUESTION:  Do you have an expectation for how the seminars will be allocated at the various locations.  In other words, do you anticipate an equal number to be conducted at all locations or do you believe that some cities will have more or fewer seminars based on employee size or other demographic information?

ANSWER:  Unfortunately, the number of seminars varies location by location, and that decision is determined by each regional Transition and Relocation Manager.  They are the area specialists, identifying the member needs, state by state and region by region.  The Coast Guard does not anticipate an equal number of seminars at each location.  Some cities may have more, while others may have none.  Seminars are based on several factors such as number of military members separating, location, and operational commitments.

18.  QUESTION:  The solicitation states that a minimum of 10, and a maximum of 35 seminars are estimated.  To ensure a more level field for all bidders, and for costing purposes, what number of seminars should we use to determine a cost?

ANSWER:  Base it on 10 because the Coast Guard is guaranteeing 10.  The number will likely be more than that, but we do not have any idea what it would be, but it will not be more than 35.    

19.  QUESTION:  How many days is Seminar B expected to run?

ANSWER:  Each seminar shall be a maximum of 3.5 days in length.

20.  QUESTION:  Would it make a difference if the Seminar Instructors had Master degrees?

ANSWER:    No.  The offeror should propose individuals who can fulfill the requirement.

21.  QUESTION:  Would it be feasible to have the assessment tools be completed on-line rather than paper?

ANSWER:  If the vendor would like to provide the assessment online rather than on paper that is perfectly acceptable.  However, not all members, have access to computers and only one Transition Relocation Manager has a classroom with 20 computers.  Most seminars are done in a hotel or in a room without access to online capabilities.  The vendor would have to come up with a way to administer the assessment.  Which may be quite difficult since Coast Guard members are not located at one place.  Coast Guard members are located at several different areas and will be from several different units.  
   
22.  QUESTION:  Would it be advantageous to have a 3 ½ - 4 day seminar?

ANSWER:   3 to 3.5 days is an appropriate amount of time for a seminar.  Students tend to travel on Mondays and Fridays and attend the seminar Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

23.  QUESTION:  Will the contract be split with more than one contractor?

ANSWER:   The contract will be awarded to one contractor.

24.  QUESTION:  The last contract award was for what total, excluding travel?

ANSWER:   Native American Management Services, Inc. was awarded a contract in the amount of $672,597.00.  Westward Systems, Inc. was awarded a contract in the amount of $1,393,736.00.  The Ryan Group, Inc was awarded a contract in the amount of $1,280,411.00.   

25.  QUESTION:  What other questions have been asked and what were the responses?

ANSWER:  The modification is providing all of the questions and answers received to date.

26  QUESTION:  What is the average number of participants per seminar?

ANSWER:  35 is the maximum number of students.  On an APPROXIMATE average 25-29 students attend each seminar.  

27.  QUESTION:  Are the six locations listed in the solicitation the only ones to be serviced?

ANSWER:  No.  Coast Guard Transition Managers are responsible for regional areas.  We listed a few of the more predominant areas based on past history.  Other areas may include but are not limited to Seattle, WA, San Diego, CA, and areas of Texas.

28.  QUESTION:  Is there a service provider who has been conducting the seminars in the past?

ANSWER:  The contract was awarded to Westward Systems, Inc., The Ryan Group, Inc., and Native American Management Services, Inc. 

29.  QUESTION:  The RFP requires the contractor to “use the most current Department of Labor (DOL) Transition Assistance Manual.  Materials and topics must be presented in accordance with the table of contents.” Could you please advise as to where we can see this document?

ANSWER:  For more information on the Transition Assistance Program (TAP MANUAL) and the Program, can be found at:  <http://www.dol.gov/vets/> scroll down to: Transition Assistance Program (TAP) Information http://www.dol.gov/vets/www.dol.gov/vets/tap/Rpt-Summary.htm The Transition Assistance Program (TAP) Manual 

Sections 1 - 2   <http://www.dol.gov/vets/tap/TAP1  2.pdf>
Sections 3 – 4   <http://www.dol.gov/vets/tap/TAP3  4.pdf>
Sections 5 – 6   <http://www.dol.gov/vets/tap/TAP5  6.pdf>

30.  QUESTION:  Would you consider a proposal limited to separating or retiring Coast Guard attorneys?

ANSWER:  This contract is for all members of the Coast Guard and does not offer exclusive assistance to one group over another.  What we have found is that all our professions and occupations have unique career transition requirements, that differ remarkably from one another, and it is the uniqueness of their differences and the blending of the combination of those professions in our seminars, that builds a network of transitional network, and opportunities that raises the bar of the current Coast Guard transition Classes.  

31.  QUESTION:  Our question is whether there is a outline to follow for the proposal submission and any other requirements such a formal registration requirement to precede the submission.

ANSWER: Submit proposals in three separate volumes.  Provide a total of 6 copies (1 original and 5 copies).  Volume I – Technical Proposal.  Volume II – Past Performance Information, Volume III – Cost Proposal.  The offeror must number the pages, and bind each set of Technical proposals, Past Performance and Price Proposals in a three-ring loose-leaf binder.  Submit resumes in each copy of Volume I under a tab divider.  

32.  QUESTION:  Is the RFP information that was posted on the Febizopps the full RFP?  If not, can you give us the link to access the full RFP?

ANSWER:  Yes.  The RFP information that was posted in FedBizopps on December 23, 2003, is the full RFP.

33. QUESTION:  Can our proposal be emailed to the identified office instead of regular mail?  

ANSWER:  Yes.  The proposal must identify each submission separately. 

34.  QUESTION:  The synopsis/solicitation (s/s) indicated that there were two enclosures provided with the s/s but I was unable to access those.  Please provide information on “HOW TO” access these two documents.

ANSWER:  If you were unable to access the two documents you can send a e-mail with your fax number, to squeen@comdt.uscg.mil and croyster@comdt.uscg.mil and a copy will be faxed to you.

35.  QUESTION:  FAR 12.6 provides for use if “evaluation factors” are used, but I could not find the “Evaluation Factors For Award” in the s/s.  Would you please provide an explanation as to how you intend to evaluate this s/s and what those factors are and there relative importance.

ANSWER:   This information was provided under the synopsis dated December 23, 2003.  The Government will award the contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors: (i) Technical capability: offeror shall submit the following information for technical evaluation: (a) Describe your technical approach for satisfying the requirements for Seminar A and Seminar B, including any topics that you intend to address in each seminar that are in addition to those required by the solicitation, (b) Describe how you will recruit and hire qualified seminar instructors; (ii) Past Performance: Provide a list of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders completed during the past 3 years; a list of similar contracts currently in process; or a combination of both.  Similar contracts listed may include any contract entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, and commercial customers.  Include the following formation: (a) Name of Contract Activity; (b) Contract Number, (c) Contract Type; (d) Total Contract Value; (e) Description of Contract Work; (f) Contracting Officer Name and Telephone Number; (g) Program Manager Name and Telephone Number (if applicable); (h) Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative Name and Telephone Number; and (i) Administrative Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (if different from (f)); and (iii) Price:  The Government will award the contract to the offeror who has the best overall value on the basis of its offer and its capability to perform the work.  Technical capability and past performance are of equal importance, and when combined are of more importance than price.

36.  QUESTION:  The requirement for the contractor to hold a “progress meeting with the COTR and/or Alternate COTR upon request of the Government” should be quantified due to this request being so open ended that any bidder would be unable to develop a cost for this requirement and the Government may receive higher bids than necessary.  The same issue applies to these meetings being conducted by three different methods: 1) telephone, 2) e-mail, and/or 3) in person at the discretion of the government.  The associated costs of bidding this effort is substantially different if conducted by telephone and e-mail as opposed to having the contractor conduct the meeting “in person.”  Since there was no “geographic limitation” provided in the s/s, this requirement does not take into account those contractors that may be located outside the “beltway.”

ANSWER:  Scheduled within 10 days after award of contract, the first meeting shall be in person.  Schedule meetings after the initial meeting can be telephonic.  

37.  QUESTION:  The request for resumes did not identify how these resumes were to be evaluated.  This is similar to our request for evaluation factors for Question 2.

ANSWER:  The resumes will be used to identify Key Personnel under the contract.

38.  QUESTION:  Could you please provide where we can obtain the document information so we can ensure that our employees” …observe and comply with all applicable local and headquarters regulations, policies and procedures” etc. as required by the s/s.

ANSWER:  The intent of the referenced sentence was for the contractor to follow along with all procedures and rules while on a military base.  The individual bases will provide/post those regulations upon entry.

39.  QUESTION:  In other solicitations, we have observed that “travel” reimbursement has been “exclusive” of G&A.  We would appreciate an explanation on whether G&A is to be allowed under this s/s.

ANSWER:  Because of the extent of travel being propose the Coast Guard recognizes that the offeror will incur additional cost, therefore travel will be inclusive of G&A. 

40.  QUESTION:  You refer to the contractor providing “…sufficient qualified personnel for adequate and timely service.”  Please provide the governments definition of” …sufficient qualified personnel…” under this RFQ.

ANSWER:  Qualified personnel means: a) Bachelor’s degree in any field and b) three years experience providing career services.  In lieu of a Bachelors degree, equivalent work experience may be substituted on the basis that a Bachelors degree equals six years work experience.  Any substituted work experience shall be in addition to the required stated minimum of three years experience providing career services.  Adequate and timely service means being prompt for the seminar start times, and covering all topics required.

41.  QUESTION:  Can you tell us approximately how many participants will be scheduled to attend per class?

ANSWER:   Unfortunately, the number of attendees varies year by year and location by location.  Based on the number of seminars that are held within the region that each transition Manager is responsible for.  Attendance is an unknown factor.  Seminars are based on several factors such as number of military members separating, location, and operational commitments to name a few.

42.  QUESTION:  Will there spouses be required to attend as well?

ANSWER:  Spouses are encouraged and welcome to attend.  Those that do attend encompass approximately 10%.  Instructional material is expected to be provided for them individually.       

43.  QUESTION:  Please estimate the number of expected attendees for Seminar A (enlisted and officer ranks) and Seminar B (flag officers and executive level) either by location or anticipated total attendance for all locations for the base year.

ANSWER:  Unfortunately, the number of attendees varies year by year and location by location.  Based on the number of seminars that are held within the region that each transition Manager is responsible for.  Attendance is an unknown factor.  Seminars are based on several factors such as number of military members separating, location, and operational commitments to name a few.

<DESC>MODIFICATION 0003.  The purpose of this modification is to answer questions received from offerors, and to extend the due date for proposals to 2:00pm, January 28, 2004.

ANSWER:  Yes, travel was included in the dollar amount.

4.  QUESTION:  In the previous awards to the three incumbent contractors, was this a multiple award, or were these contractors used over a period of time?  If so, please indicate, which periods of time, each was utilized, and which year each contractor was contracted.

ANSWER:  Yes, the previous award was a multiple award.  Westward Systems, Inc., covered the period 2/19/99 – 9/30/03.  The Ryan Group, Inc., covered the period from 2/19/99 – 9/19/01.   Native American Management Services, Inc., covered the period from 3/16/00 – 9/30/03.
  
5.  QUESTION:  I am inquiry regarding the statement.  The contractor shall use the most current Department of Labor (DOL) Transition Assistance Manuel.  We are taking that for this training you are requesting we contact the Dept. of Labor and request their manual to use.  Or are we to use our own training manual and make sure we cover the topics outline in the Dept. of Labor TAP’s manual?  Could you please clarify the requirement?

ANSWER:  The Transition Relocation Manager who arranges the class is responsible for getting the participants manuals from the Department of Labor (DOL).  The manuals will be at the class location and the instructor is expected to use the most current DOL manual for instruction.

6.  QUESTION:  Can you tell us approximately how many participants will be scheduled to attend per class?

ANSWER:  The maximum number per class is 35.  There is no way to determine exactly how many will be in each class at this point.  This varies based on class location and number of Coast Guard units in the area.  There is a statement in the solicitation that requires the contractor to contact the local Transition Relocation Manager prior to the class and the contractor would be told at that time how many would be in that particular class.

ANSWER:   Spouses are encouraged and welcome to attend.  Those that do attend encompass approximately 10%.  Instructional material is expected to be provided for them individually.

ANSWER:  Yes.  The proposal must identify each submission separately.

10.  QUESTION:  What is allowable G&A rate and guidelines for Profit/Fee?

ANSWER:  G&A rates are specific to individual companies.  The FAR gives guidance as to what is allowable and unallowable.  Profit/Fee is a management decision.  Profit/Fee is unique to the individual corporation.  Both are subject to a determination of fair and reasonable.     

11.  QUESTION:  Answers to Q3 & Q31 seem contradictory.  Is the answer 3 bound copies or 6?  If e-mailed, are there special instructions as to format?

ANSWER:  Submit 6 copies (1 original and 5 copies).  The proposal must identify each submission separately.

12.  QUESTION:  We cannot locate “10 Step Overview Process” at www.opm.gov

ANSWER:  http://www.usajobs.opm.gov/firsttimers.asp.  This site links to the Federal Job process.

13.  QUESTION:  The RFP noted above dictates that “the contractor shall provide”, among other things, “all supplemental materials” in order to conduct the training, yet there is no indication of the number of expected participants.  Can you provide any clarification on this matter?

ANSWER:  The contractor is expected to contact the Transition Relocation Manager (TRM) holding the class prior to the start of class to determine the number of participants that will be present at that particular training.  There is a statement in the solicitation requiring the contractor to make contact with the local TRM prior to class to discuss other class issues. 

14.  QUESTION:  To clarify, how many copies need to be sent in response to the Preseparation Seminar solicitation?  As one place, the response was three at another the number was six.

ANSWER:  Submit 6 copies (1 original and 5 copies).

15.  QUESTION:  Has the USCG met its goal for the current FY, under PL 106-50, regarding closed bids to service disabled veteran owned companies?  If not, would the solicitation DTCG23-04-R-PPA001 fall in to this category.

ANSWER:  Since this is only the fourth month of FY04, the USCG has not yet met its 3% goal for veteran-owned small businesses.  However, because this solicitation is a small business set-aside, a veteran-owned business has an equal chance of being awarded the contract, thereby adding toward the 3% goal, as does any small business who submits a bid.   

16.  QUESTION:   In what form do you want the amount carried out:  Does it need to be on a per seminar cost or should it be with a minimum amount used for price submission?

ANSWER:  Base it on 10 because the Coast Guard is guaranteeing 10.  The number will likely be more than that, but we do not have any idea what it would be, but it will not be more than 35.  

17.  QUESTION:  My question is regarding a clause that was mentioned in your answers and that pertains to the TAR clause 1252-215-70?  Were can I locate this ref and is this a typo.

ANSWER:  The Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) (48 CFR Chapter 30), supersedes the Transportation Acquisition Regulation (TAR) (48 CFR Chapter 12) previously used by the Coast Guard.  

3052.215-70 Key personnel or facilities.
 
As prescribed in (HSAR) 48 CFR 3015.204-3, insert the following clause:
 
KEY PERSONNEL OR FACILITIES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) The personnel or facilities specified below are considered essential to the work being performed under this contract and may, with the consent of the contracting parties, be changed from time to time during the course of the contract by adding or deleting personnel or facilities, as appropriate. 
(b) Before removing or replacing any of the specified individuals or facilities, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, before the change becomes effective. The Contractor shall submit sufficient information to support the proposed action and to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the potential impact of the change on this contract. The Contractor shall not remove or replace personnel or facilities until the Contracting Officer approves the change. 
The Key Personnel or Facilities under this Contract: (specify key personnel or facilities)

<SUBJECT>15--T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP)
<SOLNBR>FA8617-04-R-6154
<ARCHDATE>07302005
<CONTACT>James Van Oss,937-904-4192
<DESC>UPDATE (5-28-04) Request for Information All interested parties are asked to respond to this RFI.  The purpose of this  RFI is to provide an update on the current acquisition strategy, and to solicit  candid responses from potential T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP)  offerors.  The Government is seeking to gain insight into any potential problem  areas that may result from the current strategy and to address several  important contractual issues identified during the strategy development  process.  Please answer and provide detailed information in the outline format  below to support your position in the following areas: 1.  The overall requirement for the T-38C ESUP is to upgrade the entire T-38C  fleet (509 aircraft).  Due to various constraints, the Government plans to  initially modify only 199 aircraft located at three (3) AETC bases.  The  upgraded escape systems will be acquired under an Indefinite  Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract as a nondevelopmental item (NDI)  and on a firm fixed priced basis.  An item shall be considered NDI if it meets  the definition of NDI as it is defined in FAR 2.101 and based upon the accepted  government performance standard for escape systems. The IDIQ contract will have  a five-year ordering period with variable quantity bands and a “most probable  quantity".  Although the Government currently anticipates a production and  installation rate of five (5) shipsets per month (60 per year), the quantity  bands will be structured with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate  the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding. a.  Address the 5-year fixed priced, IDIQ arrangement.  Do you see any problems  with being able to price this NDI effort? Will your company commit, and  contract for, firm fixed prices for a full five-year period?   If not, clearly  identify your concerns in your response.  b.  If increased Government resources become available, i.e., increased funding  and an increased number of aircraft available for the upgrade each month, the  Government may seek to accelerate the production and installation rate in order  to upgrade up-to-509 aircraft during the 5-year ordering period.  How large an  increase in monthly production could your current production capabilities  sustain?  In other words, what are the maximum monthly quantities you could  produce?    c.  In the event funding is stretched out, what are the minimum monthly  quantities you require to maintain a profitable production line?    d.  How soon after RFP release would a "production representative" seat be  ready for the Government+s measurements and testing in the T-38C mock-up?   e.  How soon after contract award would you be able to provide shipsets for  integration testing?  How soon after integration testing is completed would you  be able to begin delivering shipsets at a minimum rate of 5 shipsets per month? 2.  The following questions deal with several contractual issues identified by  the Government during the strategy development process: a.  It is the Government’s intent to acquire material and workmanship  warranty.  If you propose an essential performance warranty on the ESUP, please  explain in detail.  Address fully how you envision the warranty and sustainment  to operate for this program. b.  FAR Clause 52.225-1 -- Buy American Act—Supplies (June 2003) will be  included in Section I - Contract Clauses and FAR Clause 52.225-2 – Buy American  Act Certificate (June 2003) will be included in Section K - Representations and  Certifications of the RFP and the resultant contract.  Please address how you  will comply with the Buy American Act and discuss how your company will  complete the Buy American Act certificate contained in FAR 52.225-2.   c.  Section I of the RFP will also include DFARS Clause 252.225-7012 and 7014,  Preference for Certain Domestic Commodities and Preference for Domestic  Specialty Metals - Alternate I, respectively.  Similar to paragraph c. above,  please address how you will comply with these clauses and what affect these  clauses will have on the structure of your program, if any. d.  Lastly, Section I of the RFP will contain DFARS Clause 252.211-7003 - Item  Identification and Valuation (Jan 2004).  Identify your current ability to meet  the Unique Identification (UID) requirement or how you will be able to meet  this requirement at the time of contract award.  Please see the UID website  http://www.acq.osd.mil/uid/ for details.   Please respond to this RFI by providing one (1) hard copy and one (1)  electronic copy to the contractual point of contact (POC) by 3:00 pm local time  on 17 June 2004.  Please adhere to the outline format provided above in your  response.  Any questions regarding this RFI or the ESUP program may be  addressed to the contractual POC listed below. Contractual POC:  James Van Oss, ASC/YTA, Building 11A, Room 201-I, 1970  Monahan Way, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7211, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  (937) 904-4192. //End of Update// Update (5-3-2004) DELETION OF ESCAPE PATH CLEARANCE The acquisition strategy for the T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program continues  to evolve.  After reviewing the operational needs of AETC, as well as non- developmental technologies that currently exist, ASC/YTA has decided there is  no need for a separate, second ESUP increment dedicated to escape path  clearance.  As a result of this decision, associated funding for this increment  will not be made available.   The T-38C ESUP will now consist of only two increments.  Increment 1 will  remain essentially the same as it was previously, integration of non- developmental ejection seats and inter-seat sequencing.  The former third  increment, upgrade of the aircrew accommodation, will now become Increment 2. P.O.C: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil, 937-904- 4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433-7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (4-05-04) ANNOUNCEMENT OF FORMAL SOURCES SOUGHT This notification announces the commencement of a formal Sources Sought for the  T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP), Solicitation No. FA8617-04-R-6154.   The purpose of this Sources Sought is to determine whether there are additional  offerors interested in this program and to finalize the Government+s pre- solicitation market research.  As part of this acquisition, the Government  intends to upgrade the current T-38C escape system including the aircraft’s  ejection seats and inter-seat sequencing, as well as escape path clearance.   The Government plans to upgrade a minimum of 199 aircraft, but may upgrade up  to 509 aircraft.  Formal technical performance parameters will be released with  the draft RFP.  Please review previous announcements and attachments for  additional background information (posted below, if using the PIXS website, or  available on the FedBizOpps website).    Offerors who responded to previous Requests for Information (RFIs), dated 06  Mar 2002, 3 Oct 2003, and 9 Jan 2004, or attended either of the two Industry  Days held on 29 Sep 2003 and 9 Mar 2004 need not respond to this notification.   Only unidentified offerors who have not previously responded nor participated  to date should submit a letter of interest to the Government at this time.  The  Government also requests that you respond to the questions posed in the RFIs  dated 3 Oct 2003 and 9 Feb 2004 as part of your submission.  Interested parties  are requested to submit a letter of interest via email or hard copy to the  individual listed below no later than 20 Apr 2004 at 3:00 pm local time.  In  addition, the Government requests that the responses to the RFIs be provided  via email or hard copy no later than 5 May 2004 at 3:00 pm local time.  This  sources sought notice does not constitute a solicitation for proposals and no  contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement.  Important  Reminder:  Again, letters of interest and RFI responses are not required from  those who have previously responded to the RFIs or have attended the Industry  Days.   Please direct any questions regarding your status as an offeror or any other  aspect of this program to the individual listed below.   Discussions with Industry conducted through previous RFIs and Industry Days  have aided the Government in the development of its current acquisition  strategy.  The current strategy is to compete the T-38 ESUP program as a  nondevelopmental item (NDI) acquisition to the maximum extent practicable,  using a FAR Part 15, Full Trade-Off (FTO), best value, competitive source  selection.  If the acquisition strategy changes or evolves differently,  Industry will be notified accordingly. The Government anticipates posting a draft solicitation within the next 60-90  days for the T-38 ESUP acquisition.  Comments from Industry on the draft  version will be solicited at that time to aid in the preparation and release of  the final request for proposal.  Please monitor the PIXS website and FedBizOpps  (www.fbo.gov) for further updates. P.O.C: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil, 937-904- 4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433-7211.  ///END OF UPDATE/// UPDATE (2-26-04) CHANGE OF LOCATION FOR THE MARCH 9TH INDUSTRY DAY Due to the increased interest in this program, we have changed locations to  accommodate all those that wish to attend.  The Industry Day to be held on  March 9, 2004 at 8:30 am EST will now be held at the Irvin J. Nutter Center in  the Berry Room Complex.  Please note that this is the same location as the  previous Industry Day held in September 2003. The date, time, and all other  information for this Industry Day remain unchanged.  Additional information and  directions are available at the following website, http://www.nuttercenter.com.  You can also contact Capt. E. Jay Kilpatrick II,  +edwin.kilpatrick@wpafb.af.mil+, Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A,  Room 201-1, WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211, Phone 937-904-4317, or Mr. James Van Oss  +James.VanOss@wpafb.af.mil+, Contract Specialist, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A,  Room 201-1, WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211, Phone 937-904-4192 for more information. ////END OF UPDATE////  UPDATE (02-05-04) NOTIFICATION OF AN INDUSTRY DAY The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center continues to analyze and assess industry capabilities to provide  an upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s  ejection seats and inter-seat sequencing, as well as escape path clearance. The  Government anticipates conducting another Industry Day on the 9th of March in  Bldg 570, Rm. 102 located on the premises of Wright-Patterson AFB, beginning at  8:30 a.m. (EST).  This will be Industry’s opportunity to meet with Government  representatives and to understand how the Government will measure  anthropometrical values once escape system components are installed in the T- 38C mock forebody located at Wright-Patterson AFB.  This meeting will also  provide Industry and the Government an opportunity to discuss program  developments up to this point.   This is also a call for industry to schedule appointments to see the T-38C mock  forebody in a one-on-one environment with the personnel who will conduct the  anthropometrical analysis of submitted systems.  There will be six half-day  appointments available beginning Wednesday, the 10th and ending Friday the 12th  of March, 2004.  Each half-day session will be scheduled on a first-come, first- serve basis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program will be  given. An open forum of question and answers will follow this portion.   Attendees must indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 13 Feb 04 to  Capt Jay Kilpatrick Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1,  WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211.  The Government limits attendance to no more than 3  persons per interested party.   How to contact this program: POC:  Capt Jay Kilpatrick (Program Manager), 937-904-4317, Ms Sally Meyer  (PCO), 937-904-4304 ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (01-09-04) POTENTIAL IMPACT OF INCLUSION OF ESCAPE PATH CLEARANCE SUB-SYSTEM IN FIRST  ITERATION During our recent Industry Day, as well as in subsequent T-38 ESUP RFI  responses, a phased approach was suggested as a suitable acquisition strategy  for the ESUP.  We are strongly considering such an approach, but would value  your inputs as we formulate such a program.   One consideration is how to “segment/phase” the program.  In particular, we are  evaluating the benefits of not including the upgraded escape path clearance sub- system from the first phase.  It’s the governments position an upgraded escape  path clearance sub-system presents the greatest technical and schedule risk  over a replacement seat or inter-seat sequencing sub-system.   The Government will not define a design solution for the escape path clearance  sub-system. We will require its performance to be such that it will allow the  overall ejection sequence timing to be kept as low as possible so that we get  maximum system capability from replacement seats. Question:  What do you foresee as the schedule impact of including an improved  escape path clearance sub-system in a first phase of the ESUP?  Please provide  your answer as a function of total system design/development/qualification,  specifying to the greatest extent possible the issues you see as of greatest  concern. Request your response be submitted NLT February 9, 2004 to: ASC/YTA, Capt. E.  Jay Kilpatrick II, Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1,  WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211, Phone 937-904-4317 or to: ASC/YTA, Mrs. Sally Meyer,  Contracting Officer, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1, WPAFB, Ohio 45433- 7211, Phone 937-904-4304 ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (10-10-03) RELEASE OF 29 SEPT 03 INDUSTRY DAY INFORMATION: 1) List of Attendees 2) 3 Presentations (ASC/YTA; AETC/XPRU; T38ANTHRO_DRZEHNER) 3) List of Questions and Answers  Should you have questions or additional concerns about  the ESUP Industry Day info noted above please email them to  Jason.Ortiz@wpafb.af.mil. ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (10-3-03) MEMORANDUM FOR REGISTRANT FOR REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM: ASC/YTA  1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201 I Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7211 SUBJECT: T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program, Request for Information (RFI)  1.

FAR  Clause 52.215-3 “Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes  (October 1997) is incorporated into this RFI by reference. ///signed/// SALLY L. MEYER Contracting Officer Attachments: 1.Key Performance Parameters 2.System Capabilities and Characteristics Parameters 3.Additional Technical Information Requested NOTE:  The Industry Day attendance roster, minutes, and questions from 9-29-03  will be posted the week of 6-10 October.   ///UPDATE END/// UPDATE (9-23-03)  Paragraph 1 below of the ESUP T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP) RFI  issued on 8-28-03 stated that the government would be conducting an Industry  Day 29 Sep 2003 and that the specific time and location were yet to be  determined.  Both the time and the location have been determined as follows: We will be holding this conference on Monday, September 29th, 2003 from 1:00pm  to 5:00pm (Eastern Standard Time).  We will be meeting at the Ervin J. Nutter  Center in the "Berry Room" conference facility.  It is located within the  Nutter Center at 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway in Dayton, Ohio, 45435-0001, USA.   This link, http://www.nuttercenter.com/berry/index.html, should provide more  information about the conference center.  A tentative agenda and information on  local accomodations is attached.   /////UPDATE END///// The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center is analyzing and assessing industry capabilities to provide an  upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s ejection  seats, escape path clearance, inter-seat sequencing, as well as the physical  accommodation of a greater range of aircrew personnel.  The Government  anticipates conducting the first Industry Day on 29 Sep 2003 (specific time and  location to be determined).  This will be Industry’s initial opportunity to  meet with cognizant Government representatives and to discuss the known  requirements and intent of the T-38 ESUP.  We are actively seeking Industry’s  inputs in helping us develop the acquisition strategy for this program.  Due to  size limitations, no more than three (3) representatives per company may attend  this meeting. A simulated T-38C cockpit, to be located at AFRL, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH,  will be available to Industry for inspections, measurements, etc. to aid in  Industry’s partnership with the Government in developing the acquisition  strategy.  The modified cockpit mock-up will be available to Industry  approximately late October/November 2003.  Companies interested in obtaining  access to the mock-up must request this in writing through the individuals  listed at the end of this synopsis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program and the  results of a recent Air Force Research Laboratory anthropometrical study on the  T-38C aircraft will be given. This will be followed by an “open forum” of  question and answers.  Following the open forum, Industry representatives may  individually engage with Government representatives for appointments (one hour  or less) to present their capabilities and concepts.  Maximum leverage  of “available technology” in any technical approach is highly encouraged.  This  is the initial step to establish industry’s understanding of the T-38 ESUP and  to allow the Government to determine market capabilities. Attendees must  indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 10 Sep 03 via the  individuals listed at the end of this synopsis.  Similarly, if you are  interested in having access to the T-38 cockpit mock-up please provide your  request, in writing, to the listed individuals contained at the conclusion of  this synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this RFI and notification.  Submitting capabilities  and concepts in response to this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be  compensated. POC:  Capt Jay Kilpatrick (Program Manager), 937-904-4317, Capt Jason Ortiz  (Buyer), 937-904-4306.

First, the program will increase the use of and access to quality child health and reproductive health and services, as well as infectious disease prevention and treatment, and improve the health of women and children.  The program will build the capacity of NGOs working in Haiti to provide quality health services through the application of best practices and lessons learned during past project implementation.  The program will support decentralization of public sector services and management, as well as public-private partnership for improved services.   The second major element of the contract will contribute directly to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Goal set in Haiti to provide treatment to 25,000 people, prevent 125,000 new HIV infections and to provide care and support services to 125,000 people with a particular focus on orphans and vulnerable children by 2008.  The HIV response in Haiti will focus on comprehensive programs for prevention, care and treatment, building on the substantial network of NGOs and community-based organizations, as well as existing clinic-based care and treatment programs in the country.   The contractor shall be required to work in close collaboration with all U.S. Government partners in achieving these goals.   All activities proposed shall also have to directly contribute to PEPFAR goals.    Please note that this RFP is for services in Haiti and not the Dominican Republic.

RESPONSE:  The successful Offeror shall design a new seating system, including aisle lighting, for the existing auditorium space.  It is anticipated that no more than 44 aisle light fixtures shall be required.

QUESTION: The specifications call for rocker stanchions.  Irwin is the only manufacturer to produce these types of stanchions and they would be considered proprietary.  Can standard non-rocker stanchions be considered equal to the rocker stanchions? 

RESPONSE:  The requirement is for an articulating back (rocker-style) chair.  Chairs and components that meet the minimum technical requirements and salient characteristics provided in the solicitation may be considered equivalent.
  
QUESTION: The specification names Irwin Seating Co. or equal.  Can another company’s high back chair be approved as equal to the Irwin chair?
RESPONSE:  Yes; Chairs that meet the minimum technical requirements and salient characteristics provided in the solicitation may be considered equivalent.
QUESTION:  Is it a requirement to have a rocker style; if so, why?  
RESPONSE:  The requirement is for a rocker-style chair.  It has been determined by NIST that the rocker style chair is the required style for the red auditorium.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia has a requirement for a robot to perform delivery of pharmaceuticals from the pharmacy to specified wards. Sources are being sought for a robot that uses infrared signals for delivery, that has a locator system that allows for tracking the robot in the event of a breakdown or stall, that can be traced and rerouted if required, that can call and use an elevator, that will sound an alarm and stop when approaching people, that excepts medication returns from the wards to the pharmacy, that is totally wireless, that is battery powered, and that provides secure storage and transportation of the medications throughout its journey. Interested parties must submit product data in writing to Barbara Simmons, Contracting Office, VA Medical Center, Hampton, VA 23667 not later then noon local time June 10, 2004. Responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This requirement is for a lease only, not a purchase. If no responses are received, the VA Medical Center will proceed with a sole source negotiation with Cardinal Health, the only know source that has a robot with the required functions available.

<DESC>NASA/ARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for an Extremely Short Take-Off and Landing (ESTOL) Air Vehicle Simultaneous Non-Interfereing (SNI) Operations Study. Introduction As the air transportation system approaches saturation, it has become increasingly difficult to keep pace with demand through the addition of conventional runways.  New runways are often prohibitively expensive and airport expansion is frequently a politically charged issue.  One approach to remedy this problem is to introduce a new class of air vehicles that could operate independent from conventional aircraft in a simultaneous non-interfering (SNI) manner while operating from short, underutilized runways at either large hub or small airports.	This approach supports one or more of the NASA Vehicle System Theme Objectives: Enable more people and goods to travel faster and farther with fewer delays; Protect local and global environmental quality by reducing aircraft noise and emissions; and Enhance the Nation’s security through aeronautical partnerships with DOD, DHS, and other U.S. or international government agencies. Simultaneous Non-Interfering (SNI) operations would form a key aspect of this new aircraft's capability.	In contrast to conventional jets, and in addition to steep approaches, ESTOL aircraft could also have a new capability to operate tight simultaneous descending, decelerating, and curved approaches and ascending, accelerating, curved departures.  ESTOL aircraft, operating in an SNI manner with CTOL traffic, could make use of under-used airport facilities, such as stub runways, hub cargo areas, and/or regional airports.  A new class of ESTOL vehicles could make maximum use of existing airspace by adding aircraft into the system without impacting current air traffic operations from a throughput standpoint.	In addition, there could be joint technology development opportunities with the Air Force.  The Air Force is exploring ESTOL solutions in the same general vehicle size to meet a number of Air Mobility missions.  While commercial and military ESTOL aircraft would each have unique requirements, there are areas of potential commonality, particularly in powered-lift systems, which could be exploited to minimize the development and production cost for a family of ESTOL vehicles. Objective: The goal of this RFI is to obtain information on the technical, operational and economic issues associated with the development and introduction of such a class of aircraft and to identify interest and qualifications for participation on the program.  At this time, NASA is interested in identifying and understanding the physical, operational, and economic constraints rather than a specific aircraft design.  This information will be used to support the NASA Vehicle System’s Extreme Short Takeoff and Landing (ESTOL) Vehicle Sector technology development plan.  Each industry response to this RFI may address all of the areas addressed above or any appropriate sub set of issues. Assumptions for an ESTOL Class Vehicle: At this time, the assumptions for the proposed ESTOL class vehicle are as follows: Operational scenario timeframe: Year 2022. Assume that certification procedures and operational regulations will be developed to allow SNI Operations for an ESTOL class vehicle. Number of air traffic passengers will have doubled as compared to 1997. Same adverse weather capability as year 2022 CTOL vehicles. Nominal cruise speed: Mach = 0.8. Nominal passenger capability: 50 to 150 passengers. Takeoff & landing: FAR 25 Balanced Field Length £ 2,000ft. Technical Challenges: Technical challenges of particular interest include: Identification of the optimum combination of technologies to yield an operationally and economically viable vehicle within the National Airspace System. Robustness for both scaling and off-design operations. System integration. Common technologies (dual use) for both civilian and military transports. Safety of flight and minimal acoustic and environmental impact for both passengers and the community. Operational and Affordability Challenges: It is critical that the ESTOL aircraft developed be economically attractive and operationally feasible for the commercial airlines and air cargo industry.  Additionally, benefits should be identified for passengers, airlines, airports, and the National Transportations System (NAS).  Responders are asked to provide their insight into the business case for ESTOL.  Operational and affordability challenges of particular interest include: Operational procedures for optimizing airport efficiency and passenger throughput. Minimal environmental impacts (noise, additional runways, etc). Acceptable ground terminal area (tarmac) effects (limits on outwash, surface erosion, etc.). Optimal vehicle characteristics such as: — Range, number of passengers, cruise speed, takeoff and landing distance, pavement and aircraft classification number (PCN/ACN), including floatation, etc. — Number and types of containers, overall payload-range and speed, preferred loading technique (roll-on/roll off, side door etc.) for air cargo and express cargo operations. — Combination passenger/cargo "combi" aircraft operations. Minimal operational cost and integration penalties for ESTOL performance. Anticipated demographics of emerging markets as they relate to airfield access/operational requirements—global regions, climate, regional routes, available infrastructure, etc. The identification of appropriate cost metrics, especially those that may enable relative economic viability to be deduced as a function of aircraft physical characteristics. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of no more than ten (10) pages indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. The ten (10) page response may be marked "company proprietary."  If the response is marked "company proprietary" an eleventh (11th) non-proprietary page must be provided that includes the responding company name, a technical point of contact, the technical objectives, and unique development qualifications. Appendices may be provided with supporting information. RFI responses should be submitted electronically.  E-mail responses shall be sent to Michael.J.Hutnik@nasa.gov Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Michael J. Hutnik III no later than June 30, 2004.  Please reference NNA04Z-AZ001L in any response.

The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is conducting a sources sought synopsis to locate capable organizations providing services to develop, produce and distribute state of the art learning packages for 15 topic areas in geriatrics.  These will be used by the Geriatric Education Centers network, health professions students, and faculty and health professionals caring for an aging population.
The purpose of this contract, authorized by the Public Health Service Act, as amended, Title VII, Section 753(a), is for the development and production of innovative distance-based curricula for fifteen (15) major topics in geriatrics.  Topics shall include:  1) comprehensive geriatric assessment; 2) managing multiple conditions; 3) incontinence; 4) drug management and polypharmacy; 5) falls; 6) rehabilitation; 7) congestive heart failure; 8) osteoporosis; 9) dementia and depression; 10) end-of-life care; 11) nursing home care; 12) informal care supports; 13) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 14) vital aging; and 15) elder abuse.  The curricula will be utilized by the Geriatric Education Centers (GEC) network, practitioners, and faculty within health professions schools.

The tasks to be carried out under any resultant contract require not only expertise in the 15 topic areas, but also experience with interdisciplinary education and expertise in developing interdisciplinary approaches to geriatric health professions training.  
The overall objective is to respond to recommendations from existing providers and faculty within health professions schools for the development of distance-based curricula in geriatrics.  
The process requires the contract to convene fifteen experts, nationally recognized in geriatric health professions education.   Due to the short period of performance of the proposed contract any contractor must have pre-established relationships with the Geriatric Education Centers and the geriatric community that has resulted in the advancement and development of innovated Geriatric Training Curriculum.  Relationships with these entities shall also provide any proposed contractor collaboration and cooperation to meet the timeframe established to complete these curricula and training modules.  

Interested organizations should submit their capability statements demonstrating their capability to perform this work in sufficient detail to assess their ability.   Potential contractors must have in-depth knowledge and thorough understanding of the training and professional duties of the health professionals providing care to the nation’s aging population and the challenges of developing an interdisciplinary approach to advance geriatric health professions training.

The system will be installed at the Nolan Building at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The project will require Installation of 15 floor boxes, 3-workstation switching systems and the proposed design system. Government resources will provide  a certified electrician to wire the power to the systems distribution box, plus all cabling and powe r interfacing up to the distribution box. Vendor will install, align, and test the  system and the 3-workstation switching systems. The  system will be designed and built to permit  disassembly and portability. The system display capability will support mu ltiple applications. The system will  include the twelve (12) system resolution alignments, which include the DVD/VCR, and ten workstation PC alignments (one stereo and one mono per PC).  A dedicated system for collaborative visualization, analysis and decision-making; using specially designed software that can simultaneously display various types of large data sets on multiple displays. Key relationships between these data become intuitive ly apparent in stereoscopic 3D on a large central screen. Additional information should be displayed on large LCD panels and monitors alongside the central screen.  Todays information systems provide massive volumes of raw data. We need a tool for visualizing and analyzing this multifaceted data. Using a collaborative virtual reality environment with 3D reproduction of a real high risk dynamic environment combines wit h the complexity of the communication demands made on INSCOM team members to create high levels of cognitive load with opportunities for highly situated decision making.  All data received in response to this announcement marked or designated, as corporate or proprietary information will be protected from release outside the Government in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act provisions.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of License Availability - Peroxide Explosives Tester (PET)
<DESC>The Combating Terrorism Technology Support Office of the Technical Support Working Group solicits response from any party interested in the licensing and production of a small portable tester to detect tri-acetone tri-peroxide (TATP) explosives. The tester has been prototyped, and is now ready for commercialization for use in the U.S. for all U.S. bomb technicians and other law enforcement agencies.  	The PET prototype is a small tapered cylindrical device that contains three expendable test chemicals. A sample is collected or swiped with a silicone rubber based test pad, which is reinserted into the device. The three test chemicals are injected sequen tially. If TATP is present, the resulting solution turns a green-blue color. Only trace amounts will provide a suitable indication. In its current prototype form, the tester is approximately 6 inches long and 1 inch in diameter. Miniaturization design will  be required to reduce the size to approximately that of a large diameter ballpoint pen. The most probable licensee will be a manufacturer of medical devices, as this device resembles specialized medical injection devices in much of its design. In addition , proper labeling will need to be developed. A patent for PET has been applied for.  A Technology Transition Plan, data package, and license application are available for review by interested companies. Any company interested in the licensing, production, marketing, and sales of this device is invite d to send a notice of interest via e-mail to the following address: TechTrans@TSWG.gov.

These experiments will also be developed to look at the plan ning process required in the 2015-2020 timeframe which should include Network Centric Operations and an Integrated ISR capability.    Total Defender is seeking Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) partners with concepts, processes, or products that will lend themselves to testing, evaluation, and experimentation through these experiments in order to further develop and improve Global Missile Defense Planning and Execution capability.  CRADA partners will share in the resulting data and will have the opportunity to have their concepts, processes, or products validated via these experiments. Currently, there are three experiments planned for FY2005, with the last one occurring March 20056.  Each experiment maywill last up to approximately  10 days. CRADA partners may require access up to Top Secret.  Therefore, personnel will be required to have the appropriate clearance, and a secured facility.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to theÃ‚Â Government.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part,Ã‚Â any offers by potential partners and may, at its discretion, enter into no CRADAs or multiple CRAD As.  Selection of a partner proposal will be based on the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s determination that the proposed concepts, processes, or products can be adequately tested and evaluated under the parameters and limitations of of best fit for one or more of the e xperiments. . Parties interested in pursuing a CRADA should contactÃ‚Â the Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA), Susan McCulley, at 256-955-1501.-----.Ã‚Â Ã‚Â

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) requests proposals for the planning, acquisition, installation, initial operation of the first two components of a nationwide Iraq Payment System (“IPS”) for the Central Bank of Iraq (“CBI):  a Real Time Gross Settlement (“RTGS”) system for making interbank payments with immediate finality across the books of the Central Bank and an Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) system for processing files of payment instructions, both debits and credits, and settling on a net basis also across the books of the CBI.  Initial operation will also include training the staffs of the CBI and other participant banks so that operational responsibility for IPS can be transferred to CBI.  OTA seeks to have this activity completed within seven months of contract award.    

The primary goal in creation of the Iraq Payment System is to facilitate economic activity by providing efficient mechanisms for making and receiving payments with certainty and with minimum credit, liquidity and systemic risk to participants.  A sound payment system contributes to a sound financial system.  To fully achieve this, an IPS for CBI is required to be designed and implemented in a way that satisfies the functional requirements and the following policy objectives:

•	Risks related to payment systems are well understood and managed by participants individually and for the system as a whole, across all payment system components.
•	Settlement of domestic interbank obligations is achieved on a same-day basis.
•	The IPS is open to all banks with accounts at the Central Bank of Iraq.
•	The IPS is a reliable, secure, and integrated payment, clearing and settlement system that meets the current needs of Iraq and can grow to meet the changing and growing economy at an acceptable level of cost; 
•	The IPS may expand flexibly to suit Iraqi conditions by allowing for planned expansion in terms of additional future services such as securities settlement transactions, as well as geographical expansion, as appropriate
•	The IPS is easily accessible and cost efficient.
•	The IPS satisfies relevant international principles in regard to systemically important components such as the Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems (CPSIPS).  Attachment D contains a summary of the CPSIPS.
2.	Objective

OTA requires planning, acquisition, installation and initial operation for the first two components of a nationwide Iraq Payment System (“IPS”) for the Central Bank of Iraq (“CBI):  a Real Time Gross Settlement (“RTGS”) system for making interbank payments with immediate finality across the books of the Central Bank and an Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) system for processing files of payment instructions, both debits and credits, and settling on a net basis also across the books of the CBI; as well as provision of related training to the staffs of the CBI and other participants banks.  OTA also requires provision of training to staff of CBI and other participating banks so that operational responsibility for IPS can be transferred to CBI.  OTA seeks to have this activity completed within seven months of contract award.   Detailed information on RTGS requirements can be found at Attachment B.  Detailed information on ACH requirements can be found at Attachment C.


3. 	Background

The Central Bank of Iraq is responsible for providing payments clearance and settlement services to the commercial banks in Iraq.  The Central Bank is also responsible for the regulation, licensing, and supervision of payment systems operated by parties other than the CBI.  
The existing payments clearing and settlement system in Iraq is manual and paper based.  The primary payment instrument is the check.  Checks are cleared through the CBI Head Office in Baghdad, Central Bank branches in Basra, Erbil, and Mosul, and State bank branches in Kirkuk and Hilla.  The two large State banks also clear checks between themselves.  Current accounts are maintained by the CBI for each bank and settlement of the inter-bank net positions is realized on the day a check clears.  Return items are presented to the clearing rooms during subsequent clearing sessions. 
Direct intra-bank funds transfers can be undertaken on a same day basis using telephone or tested telex based payment order procedures.  Clearing of local in-town inter-bank check payments take three to five working days.  Clearing of out-of-town inter-bank check payments can take in excess of twenty days.
The banking infrastructure of Iraq consists of 6 state-owned banks and 19 private banks.  There are also a number of applications for new banking licenses.  
To date, nine private banks have obtained Central Bank approval to do international payments, remittances and letters of credit.  With 143 functioning branches throughout the country, international payments/remittances are now estimated at more than $5 MM per day ($1.5 billion annually) and are growing.  Informal arrangements with regional banks are being replaced with regular correspondent banking relationships and several private Iraqi banks have obtained lines of credit from regional banks in the $3MM to $10MM range, allowing them to begin financing private sector imports.
In addition to expanding their activities, the private banks are seeking and evaluating all possible avenues to expand their capital to, at least, the minimum ID 10 billion (US$7.2MM) required to be in place by March 2005 under the new Banking Law.  
Iraq has two large state-owned banks, Rafidain and Al-Rasheed, that together account for about $1.8 billion in assets, or about 90 percent of the total assets in the banking system.  These two commercial banks maintain 330 branches, of which about 300 branches are currently open or in the process of re-opening.  Together, the two banks have more than 11,600 employees and 1.9 million depositors.  
Iraq also has four specialized state-owned banks: the Agricultural Cooperative Bank, the Industrial Bank, the Real Estate Bank, and the Socialist Bank for individuals.  Collectively, the specialized banks account for less than 10 percent of the total assets in the banking system.  They operate about 50 branches.  Although originally established to serve specific sectors of the Iraqi economy, since 1997 these banks have been authorized to conduct general commercial banking activities.  Therefore, they compete directly with the large state-owned banks and the private-sector banks.  These specialized banks were previously engaged in a significant amount of government-directed lending.
Three foreign banks have been selected to apply for licenses to establish or own banks in Iraq: Standard Chartered, HSBC, and National Bank of Kuwait.  These banks are expected to begin operation before the end of 2004 and be active users of the IPS.  
Some automation has taken place within the banking system.  CBI and the Trade Bank of Iraq have applied to become members of the SWIFT system.  Several other banks are interested in using SWIFT.  Most of the banks are also beginning to use the Visa Payment System which handles intra-Iraq individual and batch payments in Iraqi Dinars that settle on the CBI’s books on a net basis on the day following processing. 
The CBI and the Iraqi commercial banks recognize that the present domestic system is extremely limited in regard to the availability of payment instruments, is inefficient from a productivity perspective, is inconvenient to use from a customer perspective, and thus does not satisfy the needs of users in an evolving market economy.  
4.  Statement of Work

The Contractor will plan, acquire, install, initially operate Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) and an Automated Clearing House System (ACH) components of a nationwide inter-bank Iraq Payment System (IPS) operated by the Central Bank comprising a legal and regulatory framework, operating procedures, and IT systems used by the CBI and commercial banks to clear and settle payments.  The Real Time Gross Settlement system is described in Attachment B  The Automated Clearing House system is described in Attachment C.  The contractor also will provide training to staff of CBI and other participant banks to permit transfer of operational responsibility for IPS to CBI.
RTGS and ACH are expected to be used from approximately 35 locations:  two Central Bank locations (a primary processing location and a backup processing location) and 25 other banks some of which will use the system from multiple locations. Each location will require training of from 5 to 10 people.  

Contractor will submit documentation including, but not limited to, the following: 

•	Project Plan  (as part of proposal)
•	Project Management Quality Assurance Plan 
•	Training Plan and Documentation (preliminary plan as part of proposal)
•	Testing Plan (preliminary plan as part of proposal) 
•	System Architecture 
•	Hardware Configuration 
•	Interface/Integration Plan (including specifications for communications and applications interfaces)
•	RTGS Functional Characteristics and diagram
•	RTGS Technical Specifications
•	RTGS User’s Manual (Technical and Functional)
•	ACH Functional Characteristics and diagram
•	ACH Technical Specifications
•	ACH User’s Manual (Technical and Functional)

The Contractor’s Project Plan cited above, will include:

1.	the methodology, human, and material resources the Contractor intends to use in the design, management, co-ordination, and execution of all its responsibilities in the IPS system implementation; 
2.	the estimated duration and deadline for each major activity of the IPS system implementation including any required customization; 
3.	the major responsibilities of the CBI, IPS participants and other third parties involved in the supply and implementation of the IPS; 
4.	the means for coordinating the activities of each of the involved parties to avoid delays or interferences prejudicial to the implementation.
Unless otherwise stated, contractor will submit all documentation in initial form no later than three months after contract award and in final form no later than seven months after contract award.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with the format at Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The reference number is F9TTG941140100.    Request quotes for a firm fixed price on the following:  The contractor shall provide non-personal service, to relocate 7 each F-16A static aircraft from Sheppard AFB, TX to Lackland AFB, TX.  This must be a turnkey operation to include disassembly, transportation, and reassembly.  Aircraft structural and systems integrity must be maintained.  The service must include all labor, material, supervision, transportation, oversize permits, cranes, cradles and related materials necessary to complete the job.  There will be two separate delivery sites.  Six aircraft (tail numbers 79-0332, 78-0069, 78-0062, 79-0344, 79-0360, and 80-0511) will be delivered to: Drill Pad adjacent to Bldg. 100 (Lackland Annex) Lackland AFB, San Antonio, TX, 78236.  While the last aircraft (tail number 80-0526) will be delivered to 407 N. Luke Dr, Kelly USA, San Antonio, TX, 78241.  REQUIRED DELIVERY AND REASSEMBLY:  Aircraft are to be delivered to designated locations and reassembled by 26 July 2004.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22 and 23 and Defense Acquisition Regulation DCN 20040513.  This procurement is restricted to 100% small business concerns.  The NAICS code is 488190.  The size standard is $6,000,000 dollars.  Note that FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial items, applies to this solicitation.  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable to this acquisition and the criteria to be used are past performance and price considerations. This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance Price Trade-Off (PPT).  A trade-off between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price considerations. Offeror’s must provide a list of 3 (minimum) to 5 (maximum) of the most recent and relevant contracts in the area of aircraft disassembly, transport and reassembly services performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last 3 years.  The list shall include the following information for each of the referenced contracts:  Company and Division Name; Product or Service, Contracting Agency; Contract Number; Contract Dollar Value; Period of Performance; Name, address, FAX number, and telephone number of the Contracting Officer; comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions; and comments regarding any known performance deemed not acceptable to the customer or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.  Failure to provide the requested past performance information shall be cause for eliminating the submitter’s quote from award consideration.  
The Government will conduct an assessment of performance confidence based on the offeror’s recent and relevant performance as reflected in data submitted by the contractor as well as information independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  In evaluating past performance, the Government will consider the relevancy, recency, and extent of the past performance, and the size and complexity of the past performance relative to this solicitation’s requirements.  The Government will also consider the offeror’s past performance record with regard to quality; timeliness; performance results; business relations, and customer satisfaction.
	The purpose of the assessment is to identify and review relevant present and past performance and then make an overall confidence assessment of the offeror’s ability to perform this effort.  The assessment process will result in an overall confidence rating of exceptional--high confidence; very good--significant confidence; satisfactory--confidence; neutral--unknown confidence; marginal--little confidence; or unsatisfactory--no confidence.  [Definitions of ratings can be found at AFFARS 5315.305 (Table 5315-2) at the following website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil.]  If the lowest priced offer is judged to have an exceptional performance risk rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the process stops at this point.  Award shall be made to the offeror without further consideration of any other offers contingent upon a determination of responsibility for that offer. 
If the offer with the lowest evaluated price receives a rating of other than Exceptional, then a trade-off analysis will be performed to determine which offer represents the Best Value to the Government.  
Recognizing that past performance is significantly more important than the price factor, the Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest evaluated price if that offeror is judged in an integrated assessment to present the best value to the Government.  
Offerors shall include with their quotes, a completed copy of 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items.  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The following addendum is added to clause 52.212-4:  “Add the following to subparagraph (c): Additionally, issuance of modifications for an administrative change that does not affect the substantive rights of the parties (e.g., changes in paying office, appropriation data, funds increases or decreases, changes of address) shall not require the signature of the contractor and will be issued unilaterally.”  The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, and 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Central Contractor Registration are applicable to this acquisition.  Offerors shall include with their quotes, a completed copy of DFARS 252.204-7001, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items.  The full text of these clauses may be accessed electronically at this address: http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  Responses to this RFQ must be received by June 14, 2004 3:00 PM CDST at the 37th Contracting Squadron, 1655 Selfridge Ave., Lackland AFB, TX 78236-5286.
