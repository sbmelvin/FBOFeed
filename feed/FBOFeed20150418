<DESC>The U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground Mission Installation Contracting Command is seeking sources to provide the following: 1. Special Programs Division requires a contractor to come in and analyze our biological processes, propose a solution, purchase and install the equipment and provide training to achieve the most efficient and cost effective means to recycle the water in our facilities. 2. Location: A remote site is close to West Desert Test Center (WDTC), Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Dugway, UT 84022.  The procurement of waste water self-contained recycling system will be installed more than 10 miles from the main gate. Contractor must adhere to Army Regulations; AR 525-13, Antiterrorism and AR 530-1, Operations Security as described in section 8. Please provide a capabilities statement along with the input for the Sources Sought. <br>  <br> 3. Background: The facilities are used to grow bacterial, simulated toxins and viruses, all of which are non-hazardous to humans. The facilities have no human waste, all waste generated is part of the Biological production and research process. <br> 4. Scope: The end state of this effort is two waste water recycling systems which reduce water use at Special Programs Divisions' biological testing facilities by 75% which is at the moment approximately 90,000 gallons per year. This effort will require waste water analysis, design and build, and training on systems which capture, treat and re-introduce waste water into a biological production system. The processes use approximately 5000 to 10,000 gallons of water per week but only run on the average of 12-18 times per year.  <br> The reason the systems are not ran quite as much as needed is due to the lack of water and the cost of having water and waste water shipped to and from the sight. We would like if possible and practical to capture as much of the waste water and reuse it. Examples of waste are steam blow down, biological process waste such as BSL-1 bacterial waste and basic cleaning product waste. The bacterial waste is treated with pool shock and then sent holding tanks. All of the waste within the facilities is sent to the same tanks. There is excess room within one of the facilities for a large amount of additional equipment; however the other facility may not have the sufficient space to house a recycling system.  <br> The result we would like is to have at the minimum the same quality water going back into the system with as minimal affluent as possible. There is a Tooele water quality report included which should give the target water quality we are looking for. There is also a PowerPoint with explanation of the water system in place. Both systems are very similar and should give an idea of the existing system. We understand that after the end of the analysis that it may not be either feasible or cost effective to recycle the water. We are also including PDF versions of the facility that is not included within the PowerPoint however the systems and the wastes produce are very similar. <br> 4, The work will be done on Dugway Proving Ground, the period of performance will be from_tba  to_tba_ and there are no security clearance requirements however, no foreign nationals will be allowed on the project and all that enter will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. <br> Performance requirement: <br> 1. Analyze the water and waste water systems with resolution within 30 days of award of contract. 2. Develop a plan to recycle the waste water to a state to where it can be put back into the system therefore reducing the total water consumption of the facilities. The plan must include a detailed cost estimate with parts, equipment and labor. It must also include a set of PI&D's and a timeline for completion of the project. 3.  The Contractor shall provide installation for water recycling system. The contractor shall make any modifications within existing system to ensure the proper operation of the water recycling system; install the water recycling system and test for proper operation. 4. The Contractor shall provide training for waste water recycling systems. If both systems are identical the contractor is only required to provide training for one system, if there are any differences training on both of the systems will be trained.5. eCMRA reporting. 6. The contractor shall comply with all federal, state and local code involving environmental concerns. <br> Deliverables:  Water Analysis report, P&ID, Estimated water reduction explanation, Cost estimate including materials and labor, timeline for completion, and waste water recycling system. Other pertinent information please read: A determination on the contract type, mechanism for procurement, and possible set-aside will not be made by the Government until after the market research has been completed.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>

<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.
