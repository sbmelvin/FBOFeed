Gel propulsion is a leading technology in the development of smart propulsion systems that can meter their propella nt energy to optimize range, lethality, in-flight flexibility, and/or have multi-mission flexibility.  The Future Missile Technology Integration Demonstration Missile contained a gel propulsion system that doubled the range of a current system with its wei ght and volume.  This technology must now be refined to prepare for insertion as a product improvement in an existing system or be the selected propulsion mode in a new system.  The desire is to develop a propulsion system containing gel propellants that m eet insensitive munitions requirements, expose personnel to minimal toxicity during manufacture, transportation, and storage, to have controllable thrust and minimum signature, to maximize total impulse, and to ensure environmentally safe demilitarization and disposal methods.  This will be a five-year incrementally funded Cost Plus Fixed-Fee Contract.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is for the Naval Air Systems Command to announce its intent to establish a Qualified Products List (QPL) for the production of Trivalent Chromium Process (TCP) chemicals to meet the near and long-term needs of the U.S. Government.  TCP is being evaluated for use as aluminum pretreatment, anodized aluminum post-treatment, sacrificial metallic coating post-treatment and phosphate coating post-treatments.  TCP is a non-carcinogenic alternative to chromate (hexavalent chromium) pre/post treatments.    The success of TCP in laboratory and field-testing to date has increased the demand for TCP to the point the Government Laboratories cannot supply the required quantities of TCP for ongoing planned demonstrations and implementation efforts. 

United States Patent Number 6,375,726 'Corrosion Resistant Coatings For Aluminum And Aluminum Alloys' has been issued for the TCP technology. The patent may be obtained from the Patent And Trademark Office website at www.uspto.gov.  Five more patents that further improve and broaden the TCP technology are pending.  

The Government desires to establish and qualify manufacturers in accordance with the performance requirements of MIL-DTL-81706. The Government will provide all the necessary technical details/instructions and consulting services for the production of TCP through a commercial services agreement. The level of technical support will be customized depending on the manufacturers specific needs. The Government will recoup the cost of technical services/support provided to the manufacturer through a commercial services agreement to be negotiated with the manufacturer. The manufacturer will produce a production representative sample of TCP and submit it for testing to the Government. Once the production representative sample of TCP has met the functional performance requirements the manufacturer will be placed on the QPL for MIL-DTL-81706. The desired end result of this announcement is to list at least two manufactures of TCP on the QPL. Once placed on the QPL manufacturers will provide TCP to the Government through direct sales with end users. A license may be negotiated with the Government for the commercial sale of TCP at any time.   

The Government does not guarantee any minimum purchase of TCP. Any and all production, set-up, and other cost will be paid for by the manufacturer at the manufacturer's own risk.  

The establishment of qualified manufacturers of TCP technology is critical to any pending implementation decisions to be made by the Government and/or Government Contractors. Firms with the appropriate qualifications, please issue your response within 60 days from submission of this announcement.  

Qualified manufacturers shall submit the following for consideration:
o	Proven track record of utilizing quality control techniques for the production of chemical products.
o	Proven track record of producing similar chemical products for the metal finishing industry. 
o	Proven track record of providing technical support for metal finishing products.
o	Proven track record of providing technical data sheets for metal finishing products.
o	Existing capital equipment and capabilities.
o	The manufacturer's ability to commercialize the patented TCP technology. 
o	Estimated production cost.

For a further description of TCP, please see the 'TCP Marketing Brief' located under the Solicitation page at http://contracts.navair.navy.mil. For contractual questions please contact Ms. Jessica Wilmore, AIR-2.5.1.3.2.7, at (301) 757-8941, or wilmorejl@navair.navy.mil.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Author H. Gray to serve as Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) IRAC Support Branch (ISB) action officer, providing technical and administrative support to the Space Systems Subcommittee (SSS) for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Due to the nature of the information being classified the individual must maintain the required security clearance. The individual must have knowledge of the national and international frequency management agreements, regulations, procedures, and policies.  Mr. Gray is uniquely qualified to perform this requirement based on his knowledge of:  (1) the national and international regulations associated with obtaining an authorization to operate a terrestrial and space system, (2) the Table of Frequency Allocations, (3) the data bases utilized to contain the status as well as pertinent information on each of the national and international systems authorized, (4) the regulations and procedures contained in the NTIA Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management, and (5) the technical information to be provided in order to obtain an authorization to operate a telecommunications system. The knowledge Mr. Gray has insures uninterrupted work of the Space Systems Subcommittee (SSS) President's initiatives in the telecommunication arena of space system coordination, so registration will not be greatly impacted.  The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about June 17, 2002. The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the government will consider all capability statements received by June 12, 2002. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award (1) a sole source contract modification to modify and extend its existing contract (HQ0006-00-C-0008) with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) for Scientific, Engineering, Technical and Administrative (SETA) support to the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Joint Program Office (JPO) and (2) a follow-on sole source contract to CSC, for continued SETA support to the GMD JPO, primarily in Arlington, Virginia and Huntsville, Alabama.  The current contract will be modified to add 390,000 Direct Productive Labor Hours (DPLHs) with an estimated price of $43,000,000 and extend the period of performance through November 30, 2002.  The follow-on contract, with a base period of two years plus three one-year options, will have an estimated 4,260,000 DPLHs at an estimated price of $384,000,000.  CSC will develop program strategy options and assess proposed strategies.  CSC will provide technical and engineering analysis to support Battle Management Command, Control, and Communications (BMC3).  CSC will also support the GMD Technical Director and the System Integration Directorate by evaluating contract baseline, baseline revisions and contractor progress, performing trade-off analyses, maintaining a GMD technology roadmap, developing test target and scenario requirements for the GMD Flight Test Program, providing software management, providing requirements and design engineering interface with the user, providing specialty engineering, providing GMD system verification requirements, providing a GMD Modeling and Simulation Support Plan, developing and maintaining the GMD System Level Test Requirements Document, assisting in configuration management activities, and supporting the JPO Risk management Board.  CSC will support the GMD Test and Evaluation program and the Business Management Directorate.  CSC will provide information technology support, develop and maintain web-based applications and tools to provide data and knowledge sharing capabilities for all team members, and support management decision making with real-time, program management information capabilities.  CSC will support program cost estimating, cost analysis, budget development and budget execution, as well as independent assessment support. CSC will provide direct administrative management support.  During this period, the GMD will establish a test bed capability by September 30, 2004, and accelerate the rate of flight tests to four tests per year.  Due to the risks and difficulties inherent in the expedited schedule and the nature of the support provided by CSC, a break in continuity would be unacceptable during this period and could jeopardize the program.  Based on its extensive and comprehensive experience with the GMD program, only CSC can provide the major system and leading edge technology experience, flexibility and continuity necessary to ongoing GMD JPO efforts without unacceptable delays for staffing, familiarization, and training. See Note 22.*****

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE), Richland Operations Office (RL), intends to issue a competitive solicitation, full and open competition, for wet wash laundry and decontamination services for radioactive personnel protective equipment (PPE), non-regulated clothing, bath towels and respirator face pieces in support of DOE and its contractors on the Hanford Site.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, transportation, and other items and services necessary to perform these services.  Standard nuclear laundry practices will be used while processing the Hanford Site PPE.  PPE includes items such as: 100% cotton, cotton/polyester blends, Gortex, rubber, Indura (flame-retardant material), and Frham Tex-II (breathable, cool) work coverall, hoods, canvas, boots, rubber shoes, canvas gloves and rubber knee boots.  The non-regulated and bath towel processing should meet normal commercial laundry practices.  The non-regulated clothing will include such items as: 100% cotton, cotton/polyester blends, Indura (flame retardant material) coveralls, Nomax/blend (another flame retardant material) coveralls and/or shirt pant combinations, carhart jackets, cloth hoods, rubber shoes, and canvas shoes.  There may be mop heads, and throw rugs in the non-regulated laundry.  The respirator face pieces will need to be cleaned to manufacturer specifications.  This service requires the processing of each Closed Loop System (CLS) separately to prevent cross contamination of the various loops.  The definition of a CLS, is an area, organization or facility where the PPE, non-regulated laundry and respirator face pieces are picked up and returned to the same area, organization or facility.  This system owns the clothing; bath towels and respirator face pieces and is responsible for replacements, additional inventory or inventory reductions.  The transportation service (TS) will require the coordination of TS for pick up and delivery of PPE, non-regulated clothing and respirator face pieces for the Hanford Site Closed Loop System (CLS) users.  This coordination will be between the cleaning vendor(s)and the Hanford Site CLS users. The contractor shall maintain a customer service desk to aid Hanford Site users and the cleaning vendor(s) in resolving conflicts, coordinating special deliveries and pickup requests or any other issues.  The contractor shall be responsible for transporting PPE to and from approximately 18 closed loop systems.  The contractor shall provide and be responsible for the vehicles used to transport contaminated and non-contaminated PPE.  The respirator face piece cleaning service requires the contractor to decontaminate, clean, test, inspect, repair (as required), disinfect, and bag all respirator face pieces for each CLS.  The CLS owns the respirator face pieces and is responsible for replacements, additional inventory or inventory reductions.  Respirator face piece services shall be in accordance with Occupational, Safety, and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements 29 CFR 1910.134, and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard Z88.2.  All necessary repairs shall be made to keep each respirator face piece in a usable condition.  Wet wash laundry services for non-regulated clothing are required.  The non-regulated clothing items consist of blue, gray, green, orange, brown coveralls, laboratory coats, throw rugs, mop heads, towel rags and bath towels.  This service will require the processing of several CLS, each to be processed separately to prevent mixing of the various loops. The CLS owns the clothing and is responsible for replacements, additional inventory or inventory reductions.  DOE anticipates awarding a fixed price award fee, performance-based, contract for a two-year base period with three one-year option periods.  The solicitation is not currently available, but is estimated to be released on June 13, 2002, check the "Industry Interactive Procurement System" (IIPS) website at the address below to obtain the actual release date.

A Firm Fixed Price purchase order is anticipated. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIO N.  The proposed purchase order is for the manufacture of 250 Each (various sizes) of Woodland-Temperate-Twill Battledress Uniforms (BDUs), trouser and coat, using Wrinkle Free Treated Delta Fabric; and 250 Each (various sizes) of Woodland-Enhanced Hot Wea ther-Ripstop Battledress Uniforms (BDUs), trouser and coat, using Wrinkle Free Treated Delta Fabric.  This effort entails manufacturing Battledress Uniforms that are treated with a specific permanent press treatment application to be evaluated in a wear te st in August 2002.  The permanent press treatment being evaluated is a Post Cure resin treatment where the fabric is treated at the finishing plant, garments made and then the treatment fixed by pressing and curing at high temperature.

However, the Government will consider all quotations received with five (5) days after date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order base d upon responses is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, equipment, tools supplies (except for actual banding material and clips), personnel, supervision, and management services to perform material handling of approximately 24,831 metric tons (MT) of Zinc to include, relocating, bundling, banding, weighing, and marking at the New Haven Depot, New Haven, IN. The Contractor will be required to remove sub-lifts of zinc from the block stack. Contractor will inspect the sub-lift to insure that the lift consists of only one brand of zinc.  If brands are commingled in the sub-lift, then the Contractor will be required to segregate the brands and build a bundle similar to the sub-lift consisting of only one brand. The Grade for all brands of zinc is High Grade, which consists of the following brands: Anaconda-15,904 MT, US Smelting-2,001 MT, Pioche-4,500 MT, American Special-475 MT, and Page Electro-1,951 MT.  Government estimates that approximately 1% of the sub-lifts will require hand segregation by brand. Note: Average weight per slab is 45-60 lbs.
After the sub-lift is removed from the block stack the Contractor will clean slabs of any accumulated dirt and debris and transport approximately 300 feet to a contractor supplied scale.  Contractor will weigh sub-lifts adding or removing layer(s) of zinc slabs to form a sub-lift weighing approximately one metric ton (2,204 lbs.).  Any removed slabs not added to existing bundles shall be placed into manually built sub-lifts weighing approximately one metric ton.  Manually built sub-lifts will only have one brand of zinc with slabs interlocking to prevent slipping.  A Government representative will witness the weighing of each sub-lift and mark the weight on each bundle.  After weighing each sub-lift, the contractor shall remove the sub-lift from the scale and secure zinc slabs with three (3) 1 ??  galvanized bands and double crimp.  The Contractor shall cut the banding to an appropriate length so as not to waste government supplied banding material.  Bands are to be placed in such a manner as to prevent any zinc slabs from slipping out of the sub-lift.  A Government representative will monitor the contractor marking the weight on each bundle. 
After sub-lifts have been banded and marked with the weight of the sub-lift, the contractor shall relocate the zinc to a storage area approximately 300 feet from the scale. Government estimates that the Contractor will have to individually handle approximately 15% of zinc slabs in order to build a metric ton sub-lift.
The Contractor shall meld or otherwise "work in" any broken pieces into existing bundles. Broken pieces will be segregated by grade and brand.  The Contractor shall not "run equipment over" existing stack base pieces.  The Contractor shall place broken slabs not incorporated into bundles into drums furnished by the Government.  Broken slabs will be segregated by grade and brand. The Government shall determine the tare weight of the drum.  After filling the drums, the Contractor shall weigh the drum.  The Government representative will mark the gross, tare, and net weight on the drum, as well as the brand of zinc. 
The Contractor shall furnish digital scales capable of displaying weights to the nearest one pound.  The scales shall be calibrated at the expense of the Contractor in the presence of the Government Representative.  The Contractor shall ensure that the scale certification is 80% of the scale capacity.  Scale(s) shall be certified in accordance with NIST Handbook 44 ? Acceptance Tolerance Values.  Scale acceptance tolerance shall be listed on the scale certification.  The scale shall be within acceptance tolerance values at each check weigh, if not, the scale shall require re-calibration and re-certification at the expense of the Contractor in the presence of the Government Representative.  If the Scale is relocated for any reason after an official certification, the scale shall be re-calibrated and re-certified at the expenseof the Contractor in the presence of the Government Representative as stated above.
The scales shall be tested and checked weighed each morning before beginning work and  each afternoon before resuming work after lunch in the presence of a COR.  The Contractor is to supply test weights and must be State certified for 2,500 pounds. Check weights must be consistent; therefore; the accuracy of the scale must be checked and  verified periodically.  Scale(s) shall be zero balanced after each weigh.  The government reserves the right to challenge the accuracy of the scale at any time.
The Contractor shall keep the scales and bundles of zinc free of ice, snow, dirt, debris, and any other foreign materials which may affect scale operation accuracy.  The government shall establish the tare weight for the galvanized steel banding and clips utilizing the Contractor?s scale. The Contractor shall cut off the curled ends from the banding and ensure that each bundle is clean and free of dirt and debris prior to weighing.  The Contractor shall be responsible for supplying the indelible oil paint based markers with broad line tips in either bright red or yellow color.  The Contractor shall use the indelible oil paint based markers and legibly annotate the bundle number and net weight on the top and side of each bundle.  Bundle numbers and net weights shall be at least one inch high. As a person faces the bundle, the bundle numbers and net weights shall be a least one inch high and the bundle number shall be placed on the left band and the weight shall be placed on the right band.  Completed bundles shall be blocked stacked in designated storage area.  Care shall be taken to put the same number of bundles in each row and to keep all rows straight and uniform in height.  The bundles shall not be stacked more than two bundles high.  The bundle numbers and weights shall face out toward the forklift as it is being placed into/removed from the stack.  For the duration of the contract the Contractor shall rebuild and re-band any collapsed bundles and replace any bands that are loose or broken.  The COR reserves the right to reject loose bands and designate such bundles for re-banding.  Bundles that are re-banded shall be re-marked with the weight and bundle number in accordance with specifications above.  If the COR deems it necessary, the Contractor shall re-weigh the bundle before re-marking the bands. Any re-weighing or re-banding determined necessary by the COR shall be done at the expense of the Contractor.  NOTE:  METRIC TONS OF MATERIAL HANDLED SHALL NOT BE COUNTED AS PERFORMANCE FOR PAYMENT UNTIL MATERIAL IS RELOCATED AND STACKED PER ABOVE ?WEIGHING AND RESTACKING? PARAGRAPH.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to Aeromet Corporation for the design, development and evaluation of an Airborne Infrared Surveillance (AIRS) capability in support of the MDA Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Program.  The Aeromet evaluation will include determining the potential military capabilities of the Heimdall sensor suite presently mounted on the High Altitude Observatory (HALO) II aircraft; the AIRS functions will be supported by the Heimdall sensor suite to emulate the collection of infrared surveillance data using U.S. test activities and through the downlink of simulated fire control solutions to interceptor platforms.  The required support consists of detailed engineering evaluations, design, minor modifications, and experiments and demonstrations for the HALO II aircraft and its support equipment.  There are no other known sources capable of providing this development and evaluation effort required by MDA. Aeromet, the present operator of the HALO II aircraft, was competitively awarded the contract to design, fabricate and integrate the Heimdall sensor suite and operate the HALO II aircraft.  No other source has the current requisite unique technical expertise and demonstrated capabilities to operate the HALO II aircraft during MDA data collection missions nor the experience with the Heimdall sensor suite.  Delays associated in obtaining this capability from another source would negatively impact MDA's ability to comply with the Congressional mandate for evaluating the AIRS system.  The estimated cost for the evaluation of the AIRS system is $5.6M during the 12-month period of June 2002, through June 2003.  See Note 22.*****                            

Note 22.   The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Description:  Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for ISA and PCI modified High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) cards to Sangoma Technologies Corp, 50 Macintosh Drive, Suite 120, Markham, Ontario L3R 9T3, Canada.  These modified HDLC cards will be used to support expansion of the Stategic Automated Command Control System (SACCS).  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because the Sangoma Technologies HDLC card is currently in use.  The introduction of alternate HDLC cards would require a complete rewrite of system software and re-certification of the network security plan, which would take 6-12 months.  The procurement of these cards in a timely manner is essential to support the mission.  Questions should be directed to Tiffany L. Breske in writing via email:  tiffany.breske@offutt.af.mil or by facsimile:  (402) 232-6571 no later than 9:00 am cst on June 3, 2002.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE COMBINED Synopsis/RFO FOR LIQUID PROPELLANT BASED COMBUSION WAVE IGNITION SYSTEM SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their offer. This notice serves as the official amendment to the subject solicitation and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the description of work. I. Feasibility Study 1.	Perform a feasibility study to characterize the technical challenges involved in developing a LOX/liquid hydrocarbon fueled CWI.  This will include, but is not limited to, characterizing the products of catalytically decomposed JP-7 or RP-1, investigating chemical kinetic limitations based on operation with the catalytically decomposed gases, determining the relative merits of requiring a catalyzed fuel as opposed to fine mist atomization to enable a sustained detonation, and identification of any concerns regarding integration of the CWI into a liquid rocket engine (LRE), such as maximum tube length, minimum diameter, and maximum number of thrusters serviceable per initiation (premixing) chamber.  The study should assess both RP-1 and JP-7 as candidate fuels and identify any potentially insurmountable challenges. II. LCWI Concept Demonstration 2.	Design and fabricate a CWI chamber to demonstrate detonation of the expected LHC decomposition products, identified in Part 1, with oxygen.  The CWI system should initiate combustion with a spark (baseline). 3.	Perform testing of the CWI chamber using GOX and the fuel decomposition products identified in Part 1.  Tests will be run at varying levels of Pc and MR.  Wave speed, premixer pressure and temperature, and induction length (distance required to transition from deflagration to detonation) will be measured. III. Catalytic Decomposition Investigation 4.	Determine if an existing catalytic chamber can be used in quantitative/qualitative assessment of the LHC decomposition products.  If so, and if financially feasible, this approach should be pursued for the "cracking" study.  If no facility is available, or if use of the system is not financially feasible or would not enable the program to meet schedule, fabricate a workhorse catalytic heat exchanger to perform the LHC decomposition study.  The catalytic reactor tube should allow for adequate temperature control in order to simulate hot gas generator heating of the catalyst bed. 5.	Analyze the constituents of heated & catalyzed LHC fuel for species composition and associated mass fractions. IV. Flight-Weight Conceptual Design 6.	Generate a conceptual design for a flight-weight LCWI system, including estimates of weight, volume, and energy required.  Requirements will be supplied by the COTR. Deliverables The following deliverables will be required: 	Monthly status reports 	Drawings and operating conditions of actual CWI test hardware 	Conceptual design of a flight-like LCWI system 	Final report and suggestions for follow-on investigations Informal telecons concerning progress or technical issues will take place as deemed necessary by the COTR, most likely on a bi-weekly basis. Period of performance is for a period of nine months. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  Documents related to this solicitation will be available over the Internet.  These documents are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>NA 33.  Question:  Could you provide a clarification of the term point and standoff with regard to chemical detection devices as found in Sections 2.4 and 2.5. Answer:  Point detectors collect samples from a single physical location (e.g. dry filter unit).  T he target substance must be transported to the detector.  Standoff detection involves sampling across a large geographic area from a single location (e.g. LIDAR).  Samples can be analyzed at a distance without transport to the detector. 34.  Question:  Regarding Topic Area 2: A).  The solicitation seeks prototype software.  Our evaluation of similar issues has indicated that such problems are best addressed through a combination of Commercial off the shelf (COTS), near-COTS, and new softw are.  Can you provide us with an estimate of this mix as sought in the PRDA?Answer:  No mix is sought by DTRA.  Use of developmental software is anticipated to fill gaps in current state of the art. B)  Question:  The text description of the need is extrem ely brief.  In order to price a solution, further details are needed such as a description of the business processes, the software requirements, details of the operating environments, a description of the desired prototype system.  Can you provide further technical details? Answer:  Systems shall be compatible with existing emergency response systems within US cities. C)  Question: Who is the intended customer(end user)? Answer: Not specified.  DTRA is the end user initially. D) Question:  What is the numbe r of awards expected for this area and the size of each or the total? Answer: 5 to 10 awards and contracts between $5M-10M or less each are anticipated for the period of performance (up to a 2 year base period and a one year option period) E).  Question: W hat is the source of the funding for this area, i.e 6.1, 6.2, etc? Answer: 6.3 funding 35.  Question:  Regarding Topic 1,  Would building a neutron imaging system (degree resolution)that will use 3He as the detector of interest or does it not fulfill the technical requirements of the PRDA? Answer:  The question is, what does this new system offer that standard He3 does not.  We are not interested in more ruggedized He3 detectors.  As stated in the PRDA, we are interested in better efficiency, neutron direction, neutron energy, and new materials for detection.  If this system offers a benefit in any of these areas, then DTRA may be interested. 36. Question:  Regarding Topic Area 2:  Would the development of antimicrobial compounds against bio-terrorism organisms be appropriate and/or considered in this solicitation of proposals? Answer: No 37.  Question:  Regarding Topic Area 1, Radionuclide Detectors  A).  In talking with a number of groups working on the development of CdZnTe gamma ray detectors and have published several papers that address the performance of CZT material and would like t o propose a modeling only response to address additional issues that will determine the ultimate performance of CZT-based detectors.  This work would benefit the whole community working on CZT based detectors.  Will such a modeling only proposal be conside red as responsive? Answer: Same as Question 10.   38.  Question:  Under Topic 2, is the hope that proposals will integrate efforts in a number of sub-topics (Software Development and Environmental Monitoring) or can a proposal emphasizing one sub-topic be successful? Answer: Single subtopic proposals have  the same level of competitiveness as integrated, multiple sub-topic proposals. 39. Question: I have the PRDA 1 and PRDA 2 documents, is there any other information about this proposal?Answer: No, however, keep checking fedbizopps for any changes in the solicitation and questions and answers. 40.  Question:  Does DTRA have a specific form for the cover page or do we just need to have the information listed in the announcement?  Answer:  Only the information listed in the announcement is needed. 41.  Question:  In regard to Topic 2,  we are co ns idering an imaging FT-IR system, using a completely new concept to eliminate the background response, with a consequent improvement in sensitivity of 2, or more, orders of magnitude as well as a marked reduction in the false alarm rate. As it is currently conceived, the system will detect very low concentrations of chemical warfare agents, explosives and other threats with output to a CRT, in combination with an alarm system. The approach is ideal for border crossings, where vehicles could be rapidly scanne d using stand-off instrumentation. The specific question is centered on the phrase in canisters, shipping containers and hold baggage. While our system will be very sensitive to traces of chemicals on the outsides of these items and vehicles, it will have no capability of determining the contents. Normally this approach is the basis for explosive detectors in airports. It is very difficult to fill a container of any sort without traces of the material being detectable on the outside surfaces. This is especi ally true for low vapor pressure materials such as nerve agents and explosives. Answer:  In assuming that the question is Is detection on the surface of a container the same as detection within a container, the answer is technically no.  However, surface c ontamination may be an indication of material within a container.  This could be used as a trigger for further characterization. 42.  Question:  Under Topic area 2, it states that $10M in awards are anticipated for the base period with 5-10 awards.  Does this mean that there will be $10M worth of awards as a total or that DTRA is expecting 5-10 awards of $10M each. Answer:  Proposal s may be $5-$10M or under each.  There is $50M total anticipated for all awards under this topic area. 43.  Question:  We understand that each Topic area requires a separate proposal, but in addressing a Topic Area such as 2, will you accept proposals for a single section such as 2.1, or are you expecting a single proposal addressing all subparagraphs 2.1 t hrough 2.5? Answer:  Yes, a proposal for a single section will be accepted. 44.  Question:  By methods should be validated, do you mean validation should have already occurred and be documented or can validation of the proposed technical methods occur during the contract period of performance? Answer:   Analysis of chemical and biological samples independently is satisfactory.  45.   Question:  For Topic Area 1, Radionuclide Detectors, Section 1.1, Improved Gamma Ray Spectroscopy Systems; Is there a preferred range of gamma ray energies that the proposed system should be optimized for? Answer: The intent is to detect and identify  highly enriched uranium and weapon grade plutonium. There are many different views on how to do this. That is part of the challenge of the detector design. Too detailed of input may limit the innovation. There are two goals: 1. A system similar to HPGe wi thout the logistics of liquid nitrogen; 2. A system similiar to NaI, but with a signifantly better resolution (2-3%) at 661 KeV. 46. Question:  Is the Program looking for very advanced, innovative, high/risk-high pay-off technologies or for those technologies which have relatively established basic understanding and are quickly transferable into a portable Chemical and Biological Ag ent Detection system? Answer:  Yes 47.  Question:  Is sample preparation, both for clinical and environmental samples and its integration with the array based detection system responsive and/or essential to the topic? Answer:  Responsive but not essential.  48.  Question:  Are you looking for a portable, field system for both chemical and biological agent detection, or addressing one type of agent (chemical or biological) is satisfactory?Answer:  Analysis of chemical and biological samples independently is sa tisfactory. 49.  Question: Are there any defined/desirable specifications for a potential device (how many agents, detection time, portability, weight, power requirements,  etc )?Answer: System design specifications have not been specified. 50.  Question:  If one proposes a highly innovative concept for rapid detection of biological agents, with no supporting experimental data, would it be still a competitive proposal?  Answer:  No 51.  Question:  To what extent will neutrons from the source background be moderated before reaching the detector? Answer:  In general this is unknown.  We are dealing with the neutron emission from Pu-240.  There will be some moderation and attenuation as  neutrons pass through the weapon and container.  There is no intent to add extra moderation to the storage container, but an entity attempting to hide a nuclear weapon may chose to use shielding and moderators to avoid detection.  This offers too many pos sibilities.  Our desire is to interrogate an unknown container that is suspect of having nuclear materials inside. 52.  Question:  Is partnership between institutions, e.g., with National Labs acceptable and/or encouraged? Answer:  Partnering/teaming is encouraged.  However, DOE or DOD labs are prohibited from proposing as either a prime or a subcontractor on this soli citation. 53.  Question:  Are there any specific agents of particular interest to the program, e.g. CDC's A list of biological agents?  Answer:  Actual list is classified but CDC list A is suitable for this solicitation.   54.  Question:  Does DTRA have preferred vendors?   Answer:  No 55.  Question:  I wasn't able to locate anything about the proposal format.  What is the proposal format?Answer:  The format for the technical and cost proposal are listed in the DTRA PRDA solicitation and modification 01 listed on the fedbizopps website. 56.  Question:  Under Topic Area 2, Section 2.5, you state: Validation of devices is desired. Is this a desire for the proposal or will be part of the contracted activities?  What level of validation is required?  Who does this kind of validation?Answer:Va lidation standards vary.  The intent is to use vendor developed protocols for validation.  DTRA reserves the right to submit devices to independent third parties for validation.  Cost incurred shall be the responsibility of DTRA. 57.  Question:  Under Section 2.5, what is low cost?Answer:  Less than $250K per device. 58.  Question:  a. Are you looking for a combined chemical and biological agent detector?Answer: It is not necessary to be a combined sensor. b.  Question:  Can we submit a sensor capable of only detecting chemical agents? Answer:  Yes 59.  Question:  Are there specific target chemical agents you are hoping to detect and what would those agents be?Answer:  No 60.  Question:  Do you have specific applications you would like to see these systems be used for?  What are the priority features you would like these systems to exhibit?Answer:    Continuous operation, low O&M costs. 61.  Question:  Do you have a preference for certain technologies for detection? Answer:  See answer to # 5. 62. Question:  Can government agencies such as USARIEM or USACEHR team with us in responding to the PRDA? Before we form a team, the question is:  Can a government team be a part of the team and receive program dollars (i.e. deriving direct funding from th ese activities?). Answer: No, Government agencies cannot receive direct funding, just as FFRDCs cannot. 63.  Question:  Under technical proposal format requirements, it is stated that the technical proposal shall not exceed 45 single spaced pages.  Does this mean that each technical proposal covering one sub-topic, such as sub task 2.1 Software Development,i s limited to 45 pages or that the entire proposal covering sub-topics 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 should be limited to 45 pages?   Answer:  It means that the entire proposal covering all subtopics proposed is limited to 45 pages. 64.  Question: In regard to curriculum Vitae of the solicitation, Is all biographical information, including for the PI, in Annex A?  Or is the CV for the PI in the main proposal, and counts against the 45 page limit with only supporting personnel included in the Annex? Answer:  The curriculum vitae does count against the 45 page limit. 65. Question:  Regarding Topic Area 2, Is there any interest in enhancing commercial off the shelf display-based technologies (e.g. PDAs, cell-phones, and other portable devices) to meet NBC environmental conditions? Answer:  Only if the devices can provide performance equivalent to current lab-based or rapid field assays. 66.  Question:  Where will the detectors be used:  Indoors or Outdoors?  Answer:  Outdoors primarily 67.  Question:  What is the form of the radioactive materials?  Answer:  Primarily Plutonium and uranium metal used in nuclear weapons, but could be oxides of plutonium and Uranium.  Additional area would look at radiological dispersal devices.  This could  take many forms. 68.  Question:  What quantities or radioactivity must be detected (MDA)?  Answer:  Amounts above 0.5 kg. 69.  Question:  What time frame is required for the measurements?  Answer:  In some cases, the time could be as much as 5-10 minutes, but in counter terrorism applications, the count time could be under 1 minute. 70.  Question:  Should radioactivity analysis be performed on-line or off-line?  Answer:  There will be the need to perform the analysis immediately on sight.  In some cases, the date will not be allowed to be saved to protect weapon design information.  T here is a small need to be able to transmit data so a more detailed analysis by a trained physist can be performed. 71.  Question:  In regard to improved neutron detectors, What is the purpose of the neutron measurements?  Answer:  Primarily to confirm the presence of Plutonium 240.  It may also be used to determine quantity of plutonium or locate a source. 72.  Question:  What is more important, total sensitivity or directional dependence?  Answer:  Sensitivity is of primary importance. 73.   With respect to section 2.3 Development and Validation of Advanced Diagnostics. The questions follow.1) The solicition specifically calls out technologies invoving micro-arrays. Can you give a better definition of an micro-array in terms of expecteds ize (both cell size and number of array cells)  Answer: Array size and density is dependent on the number of agents analyzed, the analytical approach, number of targets needed to resolve near-neighbors and the redundance of spots. In general, an array in t he hundreds to thousands of cell should be anticipated. 2) The solicitation mentions a desire for the use of PCR assays. Is this exclusive? Would other technologies that do not involve PCR be appropriate?  Answer:  Any technique that provides comparable s ensitivity, selectivity, speed and level of detection is acceptable NOTICE:  Offerors are advised that Dyncorp and ITT will be involved in the peer review process (proposal evaluation) for this solicitation.  Anyone having access to the offeror's proposal will be required to sign conflict of interest/non-disclosure statements.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is for the Naval Air Systems Command to announce its intent to establish a Qualified Products List (QPL) for the production of Trivalent Chromium Process (TCP) chemicals to meet the near and long-term needs of the U.S. Government.  TCP is being evaluated for use as aluminum pretreatment, anodized aluminum post-treatment, sacrificial metallic coating post-treatment and phosphate coating post-treatments.  TCP is a non-carcinogenic alternative to chromate (hexavalent chromium) pre/post treatments.    The success of TCP in laboratory and field-testing to date has increased the demand for TCP to the point the Government Laboratories cannot supply the required quantities of TCP for ongoing planned demonstrations and implementation efforts. 

United States Patent Number 6,375,726 'Corrosion Resistant Coatings For Aluminum And Aluminum Alloys' has been issued for the TCP technology. The patent may be obtained from the Patent And Trademark Office website at www.uspto.gov.  Five more patents that further improve and broaden the TCP technology are pending.  

The Government desires to establish and qualify manufacturers in accordance with the performance requirements of MIL-DTL-81706. The Government will provide all the necessary technical details/instructions and consulting services for the production of TCP through a commercial services agreement. The level of technical support will be customized depending on the manufacturers specific needs. The Government will recoup the cost of technical services/support provided to the manufacturer through a commercial services agreement to be negotiated with the manufacturer. The manufacturer will produce a production representative sample of TCP and submit it for testing to the Government. Once the production representative sample of TCP has met the functional performance requirements the manufacturer will be placed on the QPL for MIL-DTL-81706. The desired end result of this announcement is to list at least two manufactures of TCP on the QPL. Once placed on the QPL manufacturers will provide TCP to the Government through direct sales with end users. A license may be negotiated with the Government for the commercial sale of TCP at any time.   

The Government does not guarantee any minimum purchase of TCP. Any and all production, set-up, and other cost will be paid for by the manufacturer at the manufacturer's own risk.  

The establishment of qualified manufacturers of TCP technology is critical to any pending implementation decisions to be made by the Government and/or Government Contractors. Firms with the appropriate qualifications, please issue your response within 60 days from submission of this announcement.  

Qualified manufacturers shall submit the following for consideration:
o	Proven track record of utilizing quality control techniques for the production of chemical products.
o	Proven track record of producing similar chemical products for the metal finishing industry. 
o	Proven track record of providing technical support for metal finishing products.
o	Proven track record of providing technical data sheets for metal finishing products.
o	Existing capital equipment and capabilities.
o	The manufacturer's ability to commercialize the patented TCP technology. 
o	Estimated production cost.

For a further description of TCP, please request the 'TCP Marketing Brief' from Jessica Wilmore, AIR-2.5.1.3.2.7 via e-mail at wilmorejl@navair.navy.mil. You may also contact Jessica Wilmore for contractual questions. For technical questions please contact Dr. Michael Kane, AIR-4.3.4.1, at (301) 342-0986, or kanemj@navair.navy.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solitication OPIC-02-Q-005 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) using simplified acquisition procedures. Quotations are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 01-07.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this procurement is 523930.  The small business size standard is $6,000,000 in annual revenue.*****

INTRODUCTION.     The Overseas Private Investment Corporation ("OPIC" or the "Agency"), an agency of the U.S. Government, is seeking a private equity investment advisor (the "Advisor") to assist the Agency's Investment Funds Department ("IFD") in analyzing our existing portfolio and developing an annual allocation system for future investment funds.

BACKGROUND.  The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (?OPIC?) is a self-sustaining U.S. government agency that assists U.S. private investment in over 140 emerging market economies and developing countries through four principal activities:  project finance, political risk insurance, private equity investment funds and outreach activities.  OPIC assisted projects are required to uphold important American values as they pertain to human rights, workers rights, the environment, and the impact on the U.S. economy.  Over the agency's 31-year history, OPIC has supported $138 billion invested in 3,000 projects, generating over $10 billion in host-government revenues and nearly 668,000 host-country jobs.  OPIC projects have also generated $63.6 billion in U.S. exports and create nearly 250,000 American jobs.

OPIC?s investment funds program currently supports capital commitments of $3.4 billion in 28 privately owned, privately managed investment funds that make direct equity and equity-related investments in new, expanding or privatizing companies in 140 emerging market economies.  The capital structure of each fund is comprised of OPIC-guarantied debt and private equity commitments.

OPIC intends to develop a system for developing an annual asset allocation plan which will take into account the objectives of OPIC?s management and stakeholders, as well as OPIC?s present credit exposure to funds, to determine the Agency?s future allocations in support of investment funds.***** 

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:  CONSULTANT TO DEVELOP SYSTEM FOR DEVELOPING AN ANNUAL ASSET ALLOCATION PLAN.   The Advisor shall work with IFD management to develop a strategy for creating an annual investment allocation plan consistent with the objectives of OPIC?s management and stakeholders that can be used by the Agency to determine future support of investment funds in OPIC-eligible countries.*****

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.    ASSISTANCE IN DEVELOPING INVESTMENT ALLOCATION PLAN.

Assist IFD in creating a strategy and methodology to develop an annual investment allocation plan.  Consideration shall be given to objectives of OPIC?s management and stakeholders, as well as to present credit exposure.  The Advisor shall assist OPIC in developing an allocation strategy that will consider overall allocation of credit exposure, fund sizes, deal sizes, number of partnerships, and the time and resources necessary to execute the plan.  The strategy shall include appropriate consideration to the current portfolio risk exposure, valuations, flow trends, as well as absorptive capacity in OPIC's markets, to what degree the markets have the preconditions for successful private equity investing, and the potential to have a developmental impact.  The plan will then be designed to cover OPIC's markets in dollar amounts consonant with this absorptive capacity, and focusing on
maximizing developmental impact without incurring losses.*****

DELIVERABLE ITEMS.  The Advisor shall deliver the following items to IFD:

A. A framework for analyzing OPIC?s existing portfolio consistent with the criteria described above;
B. An analysis of OPIC?s existing portfolio consistent with the criteria described above;

<CONTACT>Angelina Gonzales, Contract Specialist, Phone 505-667-8537, Fax 505-667-1331, Email gonzales_angelina_i@lanl.gov
<DESC>Please note:  The revised response date is June 5, 2002.
On May 29, 2002, the "Description" has been revised to read:

Point of Contact James L. Palmer, Sr. Contract Administrator, 505 665-0743

Firms interested in participating in the two-phased selection process for this design/build project should submit an expression of interest to the point of contact (POC) shown above. 
A.  The objective of the CGR WMRM Project is to mitigate potential damages to waste management facilities and operations that have occurred, or may occur, in the event of a fire or fire-related natural disaster.  Demonstrated vulnerabilities arose during the Cerro Grande fire in May 2000 that presented unacceptable risk to LANL's waste operations 
      B.	This project provides for additions and modifications to existing equipment, facilities that will mitigate these risks. The new facility and associated equipment will allow RLW to be safely collected and monitored in the event of a fire or other natural disaster.  This subproject adds over 300,000-gallons RLW tank storage, remote influent RLW monitoring/controls, pumps and mixers to supplement existing equipment at TA-50-01.  The equipment will be housed in a new facility, approximately 10,000-ft. in plan area, located at TA-50.  The new facility will be categorized as a Nuclear Facility.  Given that the new facility must collect RLW from incoming gravity drain lines, it will be situated approximately 25-ft. below grade, and will require significant site excavation.  Geotechnical studies performed to date indicate the site soils will be considered as low-level radioactive waste.  Disposal of this waste is planned for disposal at LANL's Technical Area 54.
C.  This pre-solicitation notice is provided to assist Design-Build (DB) firms with planning for an upcoming Request for Qualification (RFQ) and subsequent Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Los Alamos National Laboratory (hereafter Laboratory), Cerro Grande Fire Rehabilitation Team, wishes to contract with a DB firm to provide definitive design and construction services for the subject project.
 
The successful execution of the work will require a DB firm to organize a specialized team with demonstrated definitive design and construction experience as outlined in the forthcoming Request for Qualification (RFQ).  The RFQ will specify the criteria that firms must satisfy to qualify for responding to the subsequent project Request for Proposal (RFP). An RFP is slated for release in July 2002 with contract award planned for November 2002.

This solicitation will use a best-value source selection conducted in two phases. In Phase One, prospective offerors will submit their qualification information. This information will be evaluated by the University to select the prospective offeror(s) that qualify to submit proposals in response to the RFP under Phase Two.  
In Phase One, the RFQ will be posted on or about June 3, 2002 at LANL website   http://bus.lanl.gov/bus5/vendor/solicitations/default.htm with a response due on or about June 19, 2002. The RFQ will include detailed pre-qualification evaluation factors and submittal instructions. Qualification factors may include but not be limited to: (1) demonstrated successful completion of design-build projects similar to this scope of work, with a contract value of at least $5,000,000; (2) experience working on previous design-build construction projects; (3) an acceptable safety record, determined by evaluating the offeror's safety record for three annual periods by using the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Guidelines to determine documented record and lost workdays from the offeror's OSHA 200 logs, demonstrating compliance with 10CFR 830.120, subpart A, and (4) a documented quality assurance program, financial documentation demonstrating past success and ability to perform the work. Any subsequent revisions to the RFQ will be shown on the referenced Internet website. Although the University will not mail, fax, or e-mail the RFQ pages or any update(s) to the RFQ, the University will send e-mail notifications of updates to interested firms who register with the University for such updates, as instructed on the website. The website is occasionally inaccessible due to maintenance. The University is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for an offeror(s) inability to access the document posted at the referenced website.   

III.   In Phase Two, the University will accept proposals, submitted in response to the  RFP, only from the offeror(s) selected in Phase One.

<DESC>Response to Questions:

The site visit started with a short briefing on how the new facility was going to be used and what our vision for how the new equipment was to be used. We want a state of the art facility to attract visiting dignitaries and high level military leaders. 

Many of the ideas we plan to implement will be the first time they are implemented by any unit on base. The most unique is the electronic scheduling displays at the Operations desk. We have received comments by the other units that electronic displays for the flight schedule will never work and we will be ripping it out within 6 months and replacing it with the old grease board. All units on base use the old grease board and take over one hour daily to write the new schedule on it with a grease pen. The three Trooper Knock Down displays will allow us to display all our flight data from an Access database and have one unit that will display either data or CATV inputs like local weather radar. Speakers installed in the ceiling grid above the Operations desk will need to be added to allow audio from a CATV source to be heard. All input to the three display units will be controlled from a central point on the duty desk.

The Main briefing room will be the largest and most elaborate of the areas needing AV equipment. Three overhead data/video projectors will provide the capability of creating dual 6?x8? images or one 9?x12? image. Lectern, equipment and equipment rack will be of professional quality and designed to meet all the requirements in the statement of work document. Overhead lighting will be controlled by low voltage controls and integrated into the touch screen controller on the lectern. Document camera, dual computer connections and touch screen controls will be routed through an umbilical cable connected to floor mounted connectors in the stage floor. The touch screen will provide custom designed macros to automate lowering the projection screen, setting up the equipment and dimming the lights for different briefing types.

The Flight Planning room will have one 50? plasma display to display data and CATV inputs from the base network and closed circuit TV feeds.

The commanders? conference room is a scaled down version of the Main briefing room. It will use low voltage screen and lighting controls, RF touch screen controller, rack mounted equipment, data/video projector and floor mounted auxiliary inputs.

The Unit Level Learning Center and Maintenance conference rooms will have rack mounted equipment, data/video projector and controlled by a handheld RF controller. Auxiliary inputs will also be available in floor mounted boxes.

 

Q. How many lighting zones do you plan to have in the Main briefing room?

A. There are 8 separate zones currently called for in the electrical plan. The general contractor has run the feed for each run into the AV closet next to the stage. The 2 lamps on the stage are not part of the dimming plan and will be switch controlled only. Locations for low voltage controls are also located next to each of the 4 doors.

 

Q. Are there dimmers installed?

A. The ballasts in each light are dimming ballasts. All other equipment will be installed by the AV contract.

 

Q. What brand of floor box will be installed in the areas where floor mounted inputs are called for?

A. The boxes that will be installed are FSR FL-500

 

Q. Do you have a preference in touch screen controller?

A. We like the style and available options of the AMX products but we can?t require a specific brand if others will fulfill all our control requirements.

Q. What is the classification of the areas where the AV equipment will be used?

A. The areas are general use areas and will not require any special security enhancements. 

 

Q. When is the building scheduled to be ready for the equipment to be installed?

A. The current estimate is 01 Nov 02 but we are working with the Army Corp of Engineers to get concurrent access for the AV and PA contractors to complete their work before then. More to follow on this at contract award.

 

Q. Do you need to be able to preview the display data on the scheduling displays behind the duty desk before it is displayed on the screen?

A. No

 

Q. Have you looked into using a video wall for the scheduling displays?

A. Yes. When we modified the structural designs the video walls required more space than we could get in that area. If current designs will allow a video wall to fit we would consider it a suitable substitution for the Troopers.

 

Q. What is the size of the area available to put the large display screens?

A. The area is 174?W x 52?D x 90?H. The space to the right of the display area will have 4 shelves to hold the user supplied computers used to feed the displays.

 

Q. Where is the plasma display going to be mounted?

A. It will be mounted on the wall between the two doors at about eye level and viewable from the two data terminals on the counter just below it on either side.

 

Q. How tall is the stage in the Main briefing room?

A. 6?

 

Q. Any specific place you want the data/video projectors mounted?

A. Electrical provisions are available above the ceiling grid in the center of each room. Actual placement will be based on where the AV contractor feels will provide the best image.

 

Q. What size screens are currently installed?

A. The Main briefing room has a 12? x 16? screen on the back wall of the stage. The Commanders and Maintenance conference rooms and the Unit Level Learning center all have 8? x 8? screens.

 

Q. Where do you intend to put the equipment rack in the Unit Level Learning center?

A. Since this room does not have an AV closet like the others we will need an equipment rack that is more decorative than the others. It will be placed on the floor in the corner of the room opposite the door.

 

Q. Will other bidders other than those present be considered for contract award?

A. Yes.

 

Q. Why did you require a 4 hour service response time? The standard is 24 hours.

A. The Main Briefing room is the heart of our operation. We have formation briefings every 4 hours and group training in-between formation briefings. Any long delay will severely impact our operation. This is also the reason we require any equipment needing extended repairs (24hrs or greater) to be swapped out with a comparable unit until ours is repaired and replaced.

 

Q. Will plenum rated cabling be needed?

A. Current information says the ceiling is using a ducted return system and will not require plenum rated cabling but we will confirm this with the Corp of Engineers.

 

Q. What other wood products are in use that you would like to match the lectern to?

A. The flight planning room across the hall from the Main briefing room has laminated tables with oak trim and rest of the building is using a cherry laminate. We will be able to provide a sample to awarded contractor.

 

Q. Are there any plans to ventilate the area above the displays behind the operations desk? It is solid sheet rock now.

A. No. We will have to cut out vents above each display and use a whisper type fan to vent the heat to the open spaces above. Please include this in your designs.

 

Q. Are there any plans to sound proof the back wall of the Main briefing room? It may become an echo source.

A. There is nothing planned for sound proofing. If your design calls for sound proofing remember that we have individuals who love to poke holes in soft materials. We would rather see a speaker design that would prevent or reduce the echo effect.

 

Q. Have you considered networking all your displays together? You would have a central point for all data to be distributed to any point that used the touch screen controllers.

A. Other than the scheduling displays and the flight planning display none of the other areas need to view the other display information. It sounds like it would be a nice feature to have available however there are several concerns in implementing a networked system. Our research indicates that video over IP is not at a level that would produce a sharp image on a 9? x 12? screen and it introduces a single point of failure for the entire building. Since we did not list this type of equipment in the original statement of work we can?t use it as performance or quality of service feature and the increased cost may put a potential bidder out of consideration during contract award.

Faxed or mailed copies of electrical drawings and key measurements are available on request. Documents are legal size so be sure the correct media is available at your location before requesting a faxed set.

Mobile Communication Services for the Clinical Center

Background 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's foremost federally funded biomedical research institution. It is comprised of twenty-four Institutes, Centers, and Divisions. The Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center (CC) is the onsite hospital for the NIH campus (with 280 patient beds), providing full support for clinical research in inpatient and outpatient settings. The CC and ACRF facility comprise three million square feet of clinical, laboratory, and administrative space and is spread over 18 floors; 3 below ground and 15 above ground.  The new CRC under construction comprises1.5 million square feet and is spread over 8 floors, 3 below ground and 5 above ground.

The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC) is seeking the services of a mobile communications vendor in order to consolidate multiple mobile communication devices/features currently in use in the Clinical Center (i.e. pagers, cell phones and text messaging) into a one device solution the network provided by the contractor must also be capable of supporting PDAs such as Palm and Research in Motion (RIM) which the government may utilize in the future.  The period of performance for the acquisition will include a base year with (4) options.  The acquisition will require the deployment of a minimum of 400 COTS devices to replace those already in use at the CC with an opportunity to expand to up to 1,000 devices.  In addition, further requirements for this acquisition include:
 
Providing an infrastructure solution, including a digital data network for PDAs, that will support the proposed devices in all areas of the Clinical Center, the Ambulatory Care Research Facility and the Clinical Research Center (currently under construction).  
 
Providing training to up to 1,000 Clinical Center staff over a 6 week period in the proper use of the new technology deployed.
 
Providing an insurance plan for the replacement or repair of devices in the event of failure or damage.  
 
Providing a maintenance plan for infrastructure hardware and software, guaranteeing repairs made within a specified time frame as needed.  
 
A purchase order will be awarded to the vendor whose proposal represents the best value for the government including overall cost, past performance, signal strength, in building, reception and network down time.   The winning vendor must have the capability of managing several accounts under one contract to allow for expansion.
  
Purpose
The objective of this Statement of Work is to consolidate the mobile communication devices (cell-phones, pagers, text messaging, etc.) currently in use in the Clinical Center.  The contractor will be required to provide the Clinical Center with a solution package that incorporates the functionality of the current devices into one device.  In addition, the contractor will be responsible for providing an infrastructure solution to support the proposed device. The digital data network must be capable of supporting handheld PDAs (i.e. Palm, Research In Motion (RIM), etc.) as well. 
 
Scope of Work
 
At award of purchase order the contractor will be required to:
Provide the Clinical Center with approximately 400 cell phones.   The government may require additional phones under this requirement and therefore requests a cost breakdown structure that will allow increases of phones in units of 50 up to a maximum of 1000 devices. 
 
Provide a comprehensive rate plan that allows "pooled" minutes to be shared by all devices
 
Provide an in-building coverage solution (including installation) that will guarantee 98% coverage and signal strength of -85 to -90 dbm in the Clinical Center (CC), the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF) and the Clinical Research Center (CRC), currently under construction.
 		
*Prove an architecture that couldbe scalable across multiple buildings to support future requirements.
*Provide technical specifications of the proposed architecture for the government's review and acceptance, as well as any infrastructure changes (hardware, software, power, etc.)
Contractor must obtain government approval and/or escorted access to certain areas of the building, for example, rooftops, buildings under construction, restrictive rooms
*Provide an insurance plan for all lost/damaged hardware proposed under this requirement that must be reviewed and approved by the government prior to initiation of deployment.
*Provide a maintenance plan for the infrastructure installation that must be reviewed and approved by the government prior to initiation of deployment.
*The Clinical Center may incorporate Personal Digital Assistant devices under this requirement as well and requests the vendor to submit a cost pricing structure for an initial 100 devices.  Pooled message blocks, bandwidth, and air-time minutes plans are required to be provided by the vendor under the pooled minutes plan mentioned previously.

 
Program Management/Control Requirements
 
The contractor will meet initially with the CIO and his senior management team to establish a timeline for completion of the suggested infrastructure installation.
 
The contractor will provide weekly reports in writing to the project officer regarding progress of infrastructure installation.
 
The contractor will provide representatives for a period of 1 week between the hours of 6:00am-6:00pm for on-site training, collection of old and distribution of  new equipment, as well as development of plan for the return/disposal of old equipment which must be approved by the government.  The contractor will be required to provide an excel spreadsheet listing of all returned equipment and identify what the contractor intends to do with them (i.e. Phones, holsters, chargers,).  

The contractor will prepare monthly status reports outlining current known problems, status of all trouble tickets entered for the month for the government's account and any known upcoming outages or network disturbances.  The report will be submitted by writing and email to the Project Officer by the 3rd of each month.
 
In the event that service is interrupted for more than 30 minutes the contractor will notify a specified agent of the government by telephone to report the status of the network and estimate when the network should be functional again.  For each five minute period past the first 30 minutes the vendor will provide a ?% credit to the government's account for lack of service which directly impacts patient care.
 
In addition, the contractor must:
 
*Provide monthly electronic invoicing that can be shared by several computers on a network

*Provide  designated sales/service representative who can be reached by a direct phone line

*Provide documented escalation procedures including contact names and numbers.

*Conduct a pre-test of 20-30 telephone sets prior to the building of the infrastructure to ensure signal strength is adequate to users external of the NIH complex. 

*Test post infrastructures build out with NIH staff to ensure signal strength is adequate throughout the Clinical Center including the Ambulatory Care Research Facility and the Clinical Research Center (currently under construction). 

*Ensure that, in the event the frequency signal provided by the vendor for the NIH complex expands to the commercial and general public both the agreed upon speed and frequency of data transmission is maintained with 98% coverage and signal strength of -85 to -90 dbm in the Clinical Center (CC), the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF) and the Clinical research Center (CRC) (currently under construction)

Funding Structure
 
The purchase order will be fully funded for the initial 400 phones and base year of service/maintenance.  The procurement of additional phones/devices under this purchase order will be negotiated in writing between the project officer and account representative and will be incrementally funded throughout the life of this purchase order. 
 
Evaluation 
 
This statement of work represents a best value buy for the government.  The proposals will be rated on the following criteria: Cost of hardware, Infrastructure Value, Insurance, Maintenance, PDAs, Rate Plan and Training at 7.15%; Infrastructure Design 50%.  

Please send all proposals to amcgee@cc.nih.gov by c.o.b. 6/17/2002.

Please see the revised statement of work below.  All other terms of the solicitation remain unchanged.
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;  a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is Solicitation Notice No. AB133F-02-RP-0077.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25. 

The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), is contracting for submersible dive days in waters around the central Aleutian Islands.  About seventeen days will be requested in July 2002, depending on availability of funds.  The submersible will be used to study the ecology and distribution of coral, evaluate the impact of fishing gear on seafloor habitat, and estimate commercially important demersal fish species on the continental shelf of both the Bering Sea and the North Pacific side of the islands.  The main purpose of this study is to collect live samples and video footage along a bathymetric gradient from approximately 30 to 350 m depth.  Vertebrates and invertebrates will be quantified from a downward oriented video camera, and from counts by a scientist viewing along the seafloor.  The submersible will be required to maintain a near constant depth off the seafloor and travel at fixed headings.  Performance capability of the contracted dive system is critical to the success of this research.  The total submersible system shall consist of a manned submersible, support ship, launch and retrieval system, competent crew, scientific laboratory space, and special equipment as specified below.  The charter contract will begin in Adak, Alaska and end in either Adak or Dutch Harbor, Alaska.

<DESC>Response to questions:  (Most are regarding F03602-02-R-0007 but as the projects are in the same building they may provide guidance for this solicitation as well)

 The site visit started with a short briefing on how the new facility was going to be used and what our vision for how the new equipment was to be used. We want a state of the art facility to attract visiting dignitaries and high level military leaders. 

Many of the ideas we plan to implement will be the first time they are implemented by any unit on base. The most unique is the electronic scheduling displays at the Operations desk. We have received comments by the other units that electronic displays for the flight schedule will never work and we will be ripping it out within 6 months and replacing it with the old grease board. All units on base use the old grease board and take over one hour daily to write the new schedule on it with a grease pen. The three Trooper Knock Down displays will allow us to display all our flight data from an Access database and have one unit that will display either data or CATV inputs like local weather radar. Speakers installed in the ceiling grid above the Operations desk will need to be added to allow audio from a CATV source to be heard. All input to the three display units will be controlled from a central point on the duty desk.

The Main briefing room will be the largest and most elaborate of the areas needing AV equipment. Three overhead data/video projectors will provide the capability of creating dual 6?x8? images or one 9?x12? image. Lectern, equipment and equipment rack will be of professional quality and designed to meet all the requirements in the statement of work document. Overhead lighting will be controlled by low voltage controls and integrated into the touch screen controller on the lectern. Document camera, dual computer connections and touch screen controls will be routed through an umbilical cable connected to floor mounted connectors in the stage floor. The touch screen will provide custom designed macros to automate lowering the projection screen, setting up the equipment and dimming the lights for different briefing types.

The Flight Planning room will have one 50? plasma display to display data and CATV inputs from the base network and closed circuit TV feeds.

The commanders? conference room is a scaled down version of the Main briefing room. It will use low voltage screen and lighting controls, RF touch screen controller, rack mounted equipment, data/video projector and floor mounted auxiliary inputs.

The Unit Level Learning Center and Maintenance conference rooms will have rack mounted equipment, data/video projector and controlled by a handheld RF controller. Auxiliary inputs will also be available in floor mounted boxes.

 

Q. How many lighting zones do you plan to have in the Main briefing room?

A. There are 8 separate zones currently called for in the electrical plan. The general contractor has run the feed for each run into the AV closet next to the stage. The 2 lamps on the stage are not part of the dimming plan and will be switch controlled only. Locations for low voltage controls are also located next to each of the 4 doors.

 

Q. Are there dimmers installed?

A. The ballasts in each light are dimming ballasts. All other equipment will be installed by the AV contract.

 

Q. What brand of floor box will be installed in the areas where floor mounted inputs are called for?

A. The boxes that will be installed are FSR FL-500

 

Q. Do you have a preference in touch screen controller?

A. We like the style and available options of the AMX products but we can?t require a specific brand if others will fulfill all our control requirements.

Q. What is the classification of the areas where the AV equipment will be used?

A. The areas are general use areas and will not require any special security enhancements. 

 

Q. When is the building scheduled to be ready for the equipment to be installed?

A. The current estimate is 01 Nov 02 but we are working with the Army Corp of Engineers to get concurrent access for the AV and PA contractors to complete their work before then. More to follow on this at contract award.

 

Q. Do you need to be able to preview the display data on the scheduling displays behind the duty desk before it is displayed on the screen?

A. No

 

Q. Have you looked into using a video wall for the scheduling displays?

A. Yes. When we modified the structural designs the video walls required more space than we could get in that area. If current designs will allow a video wall to fit we would consider it a suitable substitution for the Troopers.

 

Q. What is the size of the area available to put the large display screens?

A. The area is 174?W x 52?D x 90?H. The space to the right of the display area will have 4 shelves to hold the user supplied computers used to feed the displays.

 

Q. Where is the plasma display going to be mounted?

A. It will be mounted on the wall between the two doors at about eye level and viewable from the two data terminals on the counter just below it on either side.

 

Q. How tall is the stage in the Main briefing room?

A. 6?

 

Q. Any specific place you want the data/video projectors mounted?

A. Electrical provisions are available above the ceiling grid in the center of each room. Actual placement will be based on where the AV contractor feels will provide the best image.

 

Q. What size screens are currently installed?

A. The Main briefing room has a 12? x 16? screen on the back wall of the stage. The Commanders and Maintenance conference rooms and the Unit Level Learning center all have 8? x 8? screens.

 

Q. Where do you intend to put the equipment rack in the Unit Level Learning center?

A. Since this room does not have an AV closet like the others we will need an equipment rack that is more decorative than the others. It will be placed on the floor in the corner of the room opposite the door.

 

Q. Will other bidders other than those present be considered for contract award?

A. Yes.

 

Q. Why did you require a 4 hour service response time? The standard is 24 hours.

A. The Main Briefing room is the heart of our operation. We have formation briefings every 4 hours and group training in-between formation briefings. Any long delay will severely impact our operation. This is also the reason we require any equipment needing extended repairs (24hrs or greater) to be swapped out with a comparable unit until ours is repaired and replaced.

 

Q. Will plenum rated cabling be needed?

A. Current information says the ceiling is using a ducted return system and will not require plenum rated cabling but we will confirm this with the Corp of Engineers.

 

Q. What other wood products are in use that you would like to match the lectern to?

A. The flight planning room across the hall from the Main briefing room has laminated tables with oak trim and rest of the building is using a cherry laminate. We will be able to provide a sample to awarded contractor.

 

Q. Are there any plans to ventilate the area above the displays behind the operations desk? It is solid sheet rock now.

A. No. We will have to cut out vents above each display and use a whisper type fan to vent the heat to the open spaces above. Please include this in your designs.

 

Q. Are there any plans to sound proof the back wall of the Main briefing room? It may become an echo source.

A. There is nothing planned for sound proofing. If your design calls for sound proofing remember that we have individuals who love to poke holes in soft materials. We would rather see a speaker design that would prevent or reduce the echo effect.
 

Q. Have you considered networking all your displays together? You would have a central point for all data to be distributed to any point that used the touch screen controllers.

A. Other than the scheduling displays and the flight planning display none of the other areas need to view the other display information. It sounds like it would be a nice feature to have available however there are several concerns in implementing a networked system. Our research indicates that video over IP is not at a level that would produce a sharp image on a 9? x 12? screen and it introduces a single point of failure for the entire building. Since we did not list this type of equipment in the original statement of work we can?t use it as performance or quality of service feature and the increased cost may put a potential bidder out of consideration during contract award.

Faxed or mailed copies of electrical drawings and key measurements are available on request. Documents are legal size so be sure the correct media is available at your location before requesting a faxed set.

<DESC>The Department of Education intends to make a sole source award to the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  The 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) will be the third in a series of international mathematics and science assessments designed to compare and contrast the performance of fourth- and eighth-grade students in over 50 countries.  TIMSS 2003 will be conducted under the auspices of the IEA and its international contractor, the International Study Center (ISC) at Boston College.

The IEA will be tasked with coordinating and carrying out the activities associated with this large-scale international assessment.  As part of these duties, the IEA is required to produce a field test report that outlines the results of the previously-funded field test, and produce the full-scale data collection materials including items like the master test booklets, the background questionnaires, test administration manuals, and quality assurance manuals.  In addition, they will be required to produce several products after the main data collection including several reports on the findings of the study, a report outlining the technical aspects of the study, and an international version of the database accessible to researchers and other parties interested in secondary research.

The Statement of Work (SOW) also includes several additional optional deliverables including an international Web site, released item sets, data almanacs, a dissemination strategy and release event, additional analysis reports, and the preliminary development of materials for TIMSS 2007.  The decision on whether or not to fund these options resides with NCES.  All responsible sources may request a copy of the SOW and submit a quotation, which, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.  For more information, contact Patrick Gonzales at (202) 502-7346 or Vidya Vish at (202) 708-8222.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Magnetic Resonance Scanners for the Osteoarthritis Initiative
<DESC>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, requests information on specifications and pricing for the future selection and purchase of 4 to 6 magnetic resonance (MR) scanners (1.5 Tesla) with extremity coils to be used for a large, multicenter study of osteoarthritis, the Osteoarthritis Initiative.  The goals of the Osteoarthritis Initiative are to develop research resources that facilitate the development and evaluation of clinical biomarkers that support the efficacy and safety of disease-modifying therapies.  Partial fulfillment of this goal requires obtaining high quality, state of the science images of the knee joint from 5000 enrolled study participants with magnetic resonance imaging technology.  In order to insure uniform consistency and quality, new, dedicated, identical MR scanners will be purchased by each of the clinical centers where participants will be enrolled.  These MR units to be installed at the various clinical sites are required to be dedicated, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scanners with readily up-gradable platforms.  The offeror should describe how protection against obsolescence of the original platform over the 7-year period would be provided in a manner that also provides longitudinal comparisons for all scan data.  Please specify the upgrade method/process to keep releases of hardware and software equipment current.  Installation of these units will require renovations of existing space for installation so any advantage offered related to portability, installation, or shipping should be described.  The MR units will require routine and frequent maintenance (costs for service agreements should be offered) and be expected to operate with >98% "up time".  Technical assistance will also be needed from the vendor in deciding scanning parameters for optimal and maximal "usability" of data from scans.  Input from company scientists related to the development of imaging protocols, machine usage, data processing and analysis and participation in steering committee meetings is desirable.  It is essential that the MR hardware selected be able to provide "state of the science" imaging data with broad applicability and potential to up grade over the seven year course of the study period.  A track record with musculoskeletal imaging would be desirable.  In response to this request for information, vendors should provide:  1) Specifications and pricing for the future selection and purchase of 4 to 6 magnetic resonance (MR) scanners (1.5 Tesla) with extremity coils; 2) A description of how protection against obsolescence of the original platform over the 7-year period would be provided in a manner that also provides longitudinal comparisons for all scan data; 3) Specifications and pricing for maintenance of the scanners over the 7-year period of the study; 4) Explain any advantages that can be offered related to portability, installation, or shipping; 5) A narrative of the vendor's capability to provide technical assistance in determining the scanning parameters for optimal and maximal "usability" of data from scans and input from company scientists related to the development of imaging protocols, machine usage, data processing and analysis and participation in Osteoarthritis Initiative Steering Committee Meetings.  The information requested herein should be labeled with the number "RFI NIH-NIAMS-02-003,"  and submitted to the Contracting Officer at the following address no later than 4:30 p.m., local time, on Tuesday, July 2, 2002.

All quotations must be received (facsimile quotes will be accepted) via mail no late r than 7 June 2002 at 3:30 p.m. local time.  All Department of Defense (DoD) procurement organizations were mandated to have a paperless contracting process implemented no later than 1 January 2000, per the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition and Techno logy).  Through innovative approaches this was accomplished, however, with the latest in technology improvement the Natick Contracting Division must continue to upgrade and improve its various automated systems and validate the total contracting process wi th each upgrade.   The introduction of the Command Commodity Standard System/ Procurement and Data Distribution System (CCSS/PADDS)and increased workforce into the Natick Contracting Division mission required an integrated Systems Automation Team to manage  the systems and functional requirements of the Acquisition Business Area.  As a result the services of a knowledgeable support contractor to supplement the Governments System Automation Acquisition operation has been identified.  The introduction of the Procurement Desktop Defense (PD2) also required additional systems management and functional requirements by the Systems Automation Team.  Additionally, the addition of Contract Automated Payment System (CAPS), Corps of Engineers Financial Management Syste m (CEFMS), Electronic Data Access (EDA), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI), and Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) as interfaces to PD2 also created additional systems management and functional requirements.  The Wh olesale Logistics Modernization Program (WLMP) is scheduled for implementation at SBCCOM during late fiscal year (FY) 03 or early FY 04.  WLMP will replace CCSS and require establishment of interfaces from PADDS and eventually PD2 to the replacement system .

The offeror is to provides essential medical health services to Federal offenders committed to the care and custody of the United States Attorney General.  The type of professional services include Inpatient/Outpatient Facility Services, Inpatient/Outpatient Physician Services and Outpatient Physician services at FCI-Tucson.

Ms. Rupp identified specialty clinics that may be conducted at the FCI.  For those individuals providing services at the FCI, they are required to attend a four-hour orientation course annually.  Ms. Rupp reminded everyone the Contractor should be reimbursed cost for contract staff to attend this training will paid at the pro-rated contract rate per hour.    
Ms. Rupp stated that it is the preference of the Government to obtain services from a facility that is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations JCAHO).  If an offeror intends to utilize a facility that is accredited by any other recognized professional accrediting body, each offeror is asked to include the documentation validating the accreditation in the proposal.

Ms. Rupp initiated a discussion of the contract pricing methodology.  The Bureau of Prisons prefers to utilize Medicare rates of reimbursement due to the regulated nature of these rates.  Ms. Rupp discussed the benchmarks defined in the solicitation.  For Medicare Part A facility services, the benchmark is the operating Federal Rate established by Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) 8520, Pima County, City of Tucson, Arizona.  For Medicare Part B physician services, the benchmark is the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for payment Locality 00, Arizona.  For Medicate Part B facility services, the benchmark is the rates calculated by 8520, Pima County, city of Tucson, Arizona.

Ms. Rupp then began a discussion of contract clauses.  Ms. Rupp noted that several clauses are listed by reference in the quotation.  Offeror needing a full text version of any clause should access the web page http://www.arnet..gov/far or call her.  

Ms. Rupp identified the Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR) clauses listing Roque Tamaray.

Ms. Rupp stated that the contract will consist of a base period with four 12 month option periods for renewal at the unilateral discretion of the Government.  The target award date is December 5, 2002.

Ms. Rupp highlighted the requirements necessary for completing the background investigations which are applicable only for the physicians/specialist performing on-site.  All physicians providing on-site services will be required to attend a four-hour institution orientation.  The cost for the physician to attend the orientation is the responsibility of the Contractor. 

Ms. Rupp identified the insurance requirements.  Offerors are reminded that the Contracting Officer must receive written certification that the required insurance has been obtained before commencing performance.  Ms. Rupp briefly explained that the contract covers Federal inmates, not just Bureau of Prison inmates.  FCI-Tucson reserves the right to grant permission allowing   United States Marshal Service (USMS),  Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Federal Correctional Institution, Safford, AZ to utilize this contract.  The Contractor shall receive written notification from FCI-Tucson when permission is granted.

Ms. Rupp began discussion of the solicitation provisions.  Full text copies of any provision included can be assessed via the web page.    Ms. Rupp discussed the solicitation information for the preparation, submission, and evaluation of proposals.  Ms Rupp alerted all participants to the instructions for preparation of proposals.  The four components of an offeror?s proposal  (i.e technical, past performance, Small Disadvantaged Business,  and price) shall be separately prepared but submitted in one package on or before the proposal submission deadline.  Please be advised that an evaluation panel will be appointed who will evaluate all responses received in accordance with the quotation criteria.  Ms. Rupp stated that the Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  All offerors are encouraged to put forth their best efforts in the initial proposal.

Ms. Rupp addressed the technical evaluation criteria.  Similarly, she discussed the criteria for past performance, small disadvantaged business concern participation, and price.  All offerors are cautioned to conform to the pricing methodology established in the solicitation, as offerors who vary the methodology create a situation whereby a comparative evaluation of offers cannot be completed.  Thus, any offeror who varies from the required methodology will receive no consideration for price in that category(s).

Ms. Rupp mentioned the Service of Protest provision.  Each offeror is encouraged to contact Mr. Byler, (520) 574-7108, initially for any questions regarding the proposal evaluation.  Ms. Rupp identified the representation and certifications requirements.  Ms. Rupp stated that completed representations and certifications must be submitted as part of an offeror?s proposal.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development & Commercialization of NITRIC OXIDE-RELEASING DRUGS AND BIOMATERIALS
<DESC>NIH scientists are developing a variety of novel techniques for delivering nitric oxide (NO) to specific organs and cell types for therapeutic benefit. Methods for targeting lung, liver, and other tissues have been introduced to the literature, as have NO-releasing proteins and insoluble polymers. The compounds and drug delivery strategies developed thus far have shown promising activities that have been demonstrated in relevant experimental animal models.  These include inhibition of thrombosis, treatment of vasospasm, relief of respiratory distress, protection against toxic liver injury, radiosensitization of hypoxic tumors, correction of genitourinary tract dysfunction, antimicrobial effects, protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury and whole-body radiation, and preservation of organ transplants. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) seeks Licensee(s) and/or Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Collaborator(s) for the development and commercialization of Nitric Oxide (NO)-Releasing Drugs and Biomaterials as embodied in a variety of recent NCI publications, as well as, in the patents and patent applications listed below.

Each Party?s Contributions to CRADA:
The role of the National Cancer Institute in this CRADA will include, but not be limited to:
 1. Providing intellectual, scientific, and technical expertise and experience to the research project. 
2. Providing the Collaborator with samples of the subject compounds for pharmacological evaluation.
3. Planning research studies and interpreting research results.
4. Providing support services at NCI/CCR.
5. Publishing research results.

The role of the CRADA Collaborator may include, but not be limited to:
 1. Providing significant intellectual, scientific, and technical expertise or experience to the research project.
2. Planning research studies and interpreting research results.
3. Providing support for ongoing CRADA-related research in the development of the particular application of nitric oxide-releasing drugs/biomaterials outlined in the Agreement:
a. Financial support to facilitate scientific goals;
b. Technical or financial support for further design of applications.
4. Publishing research results.

Terms/Licensing Potential/Patent Status:
A Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) is the anticipated joint agreement to be entered into with NCI pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended. A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. It is not a grant, and it is not a contract for procurement of goods/services. The NCI is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NCI can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise. The CRADA Collaborator will have an option to negotiate the terms of an exclusive or nonexclusive commercialization license to subject inventions arising under the CRADA. CRADA applicants should be aware that a license to the above-mentioned patent rights may be necessary in order to commercialize products arising from a CRADA. The expected duration of the CRADA(s) would be for up to five (5) years. The goals of CRADAs include rapid publication of research results and timely commercialization of products, diagnostics, and treatments that result from the research.

Selection Criteria:
 1. The ability to collaborate with NCI on further research and development of this technology. This ability can be demonstrated through experience and expertise in this or related areas of technology indicating the ability to contribute intellectually to ongoing research and development.
2. The demonstration of adequate resources to perform the research, development and commercialization of this technology (e.g., facilities, personnel and expertise) and accomplish objectives according to an appropriate timetable to be outlined in the CRADA Collaborator?s proposal.
3. The willingness to commit best effort and demonstrated resources to the research, development and commercialization of this technology.
4. The demonstration of expertise in the commercial development, production, marketing and sales of products related to this area of technology.
5. The level of financial support the CRADA Collaborator will provide for CRADA-related Government activities.
6. The willingness to cooperate with the NCI in the timely publication of research results.
7. The agreement to be bound by the appropriate DHHS regulations relating to human subjects, and all PHS policies relating to the use and care of laboratory animals.
8. The willingness to accept the legal provisions and language of the CRADA with only minor modifications, if any. These provisions govern the equitable distribution of patent rights to CRADA inventions. Generally, the rights of ownership are retained by the organization that is the employer of the inventor, with (1) the grant of license for research and other Government purposes to the Government when the CRADA Collaborator?s employee is the sole inventor, or (2) the grant of an option to elect an exclusive or nonexclusive license to the CRADA Collaborator when the Government employee is the sole inventor.
