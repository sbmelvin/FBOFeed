<DESC>ROYALTIES PAYMENT SYSTEM- This request for a quotation under the Commercial Test Program as authorized under FAR 13.5.  The period of performance shall be for one twelve (12) month period, with options to renew for four (4) successive twelve (12) month periods. The NIH/Office of Financial Management (OFM) currently uses a client/server application produced and continually amended to try to accomplish an increasingly wide range of tasks associated with the management of royalties received and distributed by the NIH.  The system consists of a desktop application written in Visual Basic 6 (VB6) that interfaces to a SQL Server database.  Due to the haphazard and outdated nature of the application, a new web-based Royalties system (using core functionality from current system as the basis for developing the new one) is required using standardized web development techniques which will be much more transparent to the user and allow flexibility for changing financial and legal requirements.  
A.  CONTRACTOR REQUIRED EXPERTISE ? 1) An integral knowledge of the existing Royalties software system and related OFM processes.  The contractor will need to constantly interact with Royalties system users and stakeholders to discern business needs, formulate optimal solutions, and implement them.  This requires a thorough understanding of all current functionality and procedures, as well as the ability to take conceptual goals and ultimately put them into practice in a manner that best suits OFM?s needs.  This requirement is of primary importance to ensure ongoing success of the effort.  2)  Senior web development and database administration expertise (at least seven years of experience developing web applications and databases that interface with them).  Specifically, senior-level expertise in developing ASP.NET web applications that interface with SQL Server is required, as well as thorough expertise in designing and implementing complex SQL Server database structures.  Development staff must have total self-sufficiency to program and support all functional aspects of the Royalties system.
3)  A core understanding of processing electronic payments through various government channels and significant experience with OFM?s financial systems (at least five years). 
4)  Extensive senior project management experience with IT efforts (at least fifteen years), with a focus on web applications.
B.  	CONTRACTOR REQUIRMENTS - The contractor is required to complete the tasks below in the indicated timeframe and address the known deficiencies in the current system when completing development of the new Royalties software:  
1)  Determine and develop the best solutions for the current requirements defined by OFM to complete the core functionality of the Royalties application as listed below. Note: All development enhancements must be completed by the end of the first six months of the base year of the award.  
a)	Design and create help screens and wizards needed to support and perform complex tasks.
b)	Design the system to eliminate tedious and non-intuitive entry of Royalty Distribution Form (RDF) information in multiple screens within different areas.
c)	Develop  ?view at-a-glance? query capability to view distribution and disbursement history of a particular inventor
d)	Design a process to allow direct access to the SQL Server database to run certain reports and to check the proper execution of functions.
e)	Design a process to allow direct access to the SQL Server database to run certain reports and to check the proper execution of functions. 
f)	Include print-friendly versions of reports.
g)	Create user-friendly ad hoc search capability.  
h)	Allow for dynamic modification of business logic; specifically, the limits and percentages for the normal calculation of royalty distributions.  
i)	Allow administrative users to change export file formats where possible to comply with yearly changes in reporting requirements.  
j)	Improve the handling of the three types of mailing addresses used for each inventor.  
k)	Permit the Royalties Coordinator to easily designate that an inventor should not be paid during a particular payout, and display a report with all the skipped inventors so that follow up can occur.  Also, improve display of data to more easily note when an inventor has been prepaid.  
l)	Develop a Payout Wizard to more easily handle the many parts of the payout process.  
m)	Allow automatic calculation of the distribution of royalties where Inter-institutional Agreements (IIAs) are concerned. 
n)	Design and create a process to allow error corrections to be made for previous months? distributions (negative income must be added and distributions balanced). 
o)	Improve distribution algorithm to avoid rounding problems (a.k.a. "the penny problem").  
p)	Allow users to easily view the audit trail for each payout.  
q)	Encrypt all passwords, Social Security Numbers (SSNs), and banking information stored in the database. 
r)	Provide the ability within the system to mark funds as being in suspense and then unmark them to include them in calculations. 
s)	Configure system for pop-up ?Alerts? which are immediately given if license distributions don?t add to 100%. 
t)	Include automatic checking to make sure that certain totals "tie" to others; this improves the speed and accuracy of the payout process.  
u)	Improve handling of company/organization recipients; currently the system is set up to handle individuals, so handling of company names can be awkward.  
v)	Improve and automate error handling when data transmission problems occur while sending data to Treasury. 
2)  Create and provide training manuals and written documentation of full functionality of the Royalties system.  At least one hard copy of the training manual and one CD copy is to be completed and provided to the Chief of Government Accounting prior to the base training session.  Enough time should be allowed for OFM staff to make additional manuals to provide at training session to be held within first six months of the award.
3)  Provide training of system to user community consisting of approximately 10 people as well as to the OFM systems group, which may include follow-up training sessions if multiple changes or enhancements are made to the system.  Training will be coordinated by the Royalties Coordinator and given by the Contractor.  Note: Base training session is to be given within the first six months of the award.  Follow-up training ? as needed for Base plus four option years will be determined by the Chief of Government Accounting Branch, OFM/NIH in coordination with the Royalties Coordinator and Contractor.
4)  Written documentation on system design and functionality is to be provided along with one CD copy by end of Base year.  As updates and enhancements occur contractor is to provide updated CD for instructional manual and system design for option years.
5)  Provide ongoing consulting and development support for new requests that OFM regularly receives to enhance functionality of the Royalties system.  This requires a detailed understanding of the existing processes and systems so that the contractor can formulate complex solutions to needs which are defined at a basic level by OFM.   Note:  Ongoing as required for one Base plus four option years
6) Proactively make suggestions for adding features to the Royalties system that will improve the payment process for OFM staff, provide better management oversight through such means as reporting, and enhance the overall productivity of system users. Note: Ongoing as required for one Base plus four option years.
7)  Provide ongoing administration of the application server and associated database.  Development staff will need to interact with the appropriate IT authorities at NIH to ensure all internal processes are followed.  Note: Ongoing as required for one Base plus four option years
8)  Provide ongoing consulting and technical support to the user community. Note: Ongoing as required for one Base plus four option years. 
9)  Assist if necessary with creation of 1099s.  Note: Required November 1st ? January 31st of each tax reporting year for Base plus four option years. 
10)  Assist if necessary with biannual (twice a year) payouts. Note: Biannual or as scheduled by the Royalties Coordinator
11) Meet with and provide progress reports to the Chief of the Government Accounting Branch monthly:  Note: Ongoing as required for one Base plus four option years. 
C.  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES - The contractor will be responsible for reporting the progress status of all development efforts to the appropriate OFM staff within reasonable timeframes requested by OFM.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for Intelligent Systems Research and Development Support (ISRDS).  The requirement is to provide technical support to perform research, and development in the area of computer science technologies for NASA.  It will consist of supporting the Exploration Technology Development Program’s research in particular areas that include autonomous systems (e.g., adaptive control, planning and scheduling, robotics, planetary visualization systems), decision support systems (e.g., mission operations), reliable software (e.g., program synthesis, and verification of the crew exploration vehicle control software), intelligent diagnostics and prognostics (e.g. modeling faults and failure modes and propagating them in time), data mining (e.g., identifying classes, and predicting recurring anomalies), and information management (e.g., collaborative and distributed knowledge management for NASA programs).  Additional required capabilities include: • the ability to sponsor H1-B research scientists • access to multiple universities and other research organizations for their skills and expertise in areas needed to support the Agency needs • mission operations support at different Centers including JSC, JPL and KSC for the Constellation program under the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) • knowledge of the Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) is required.  Specific capabilities required include robust software engineering, requiring expertise in formal methods and algorithms to assess the accuracy of flight level code. NASA/ARC intends to purchase these services from Universities Space Research Association (USRA) to perform work under the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS) to maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution.  Support will be provided for several major projects under the Exploration Technology Develoopment Program as well as under an Internal Task Agreement (ITA) with JSC in which the upcoming milestones are crucial.  These services will be required until September 2008 after which time a full and open competition for these and potentially other requirements is anticipated. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on May 9, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<RESPDATE>050107
<ARCHDATE>05312007
<CONTACT>Phyllis Townsley, 405-954-7816
<DESC>The FAA has a requirement for the acquisition of replacement panels for the repair of 200 radar radomes within the National Airspace System (NAS).  These panels are required for support of the ASR-8, ASR-11, BOS, ARSR-1, ARSR-2, ARSR-3, ANFPS, TDWR, and the NEXRAD antenna systems.  The purpose of the radome is to protect the antenna systems from weather exposure, while allowing minimal interference to RF transmission through the radome.  Each radome is comprised of several radome panels constructed of laminated fiberglass.  These panels have been designed with complex dimensions and specific RF design characteristics.  UV rays and/or storms occasionally damage, the panels causing de-lamination to occur.  These panels lose their structural integrity and leak water onto the antenna system, resulting in radar outage and could compromise air traffic control coverage. The requirement is for a base year and includes option provisions to renew for four additional 1-year periods, to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA.  The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with that L-3 Communications ESSCO, 48 Old Powder Mill Road, Concord, MA 01742, in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4. A market survey was conducted in April 3, 2007, through April 10, 2007, and the results of this survey supported the determination to solicit and negotiate with only one firm.  This announcement is for information purposes only.

<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&D) proposals in the area of Ultraperformance Nanophotonic Intrachip Communications (UNIC) with the goal of demonstrating low power, high bandwidth, low latency intrachip photonic communication networks designed to enable chip multiprocessors with hundreds or thousands of compute cores to realize extremely high computational efficiency (actual performance).  The proposer will be expected to select aggressive chip multiprocessor design drivers in a future technology node (~ 20 nm), and to design for them credible, high connectivity photonic networks that are non-blocking and have low message latencies, narrow latency distributions, high communication bandwidth (to accommodate all expected traffic) and other characteristics that minimize programming effort.  Detailed analyses of network communication parameters and demonstration of system-level performance benefits for their chosen network designs are expected.  The proposer will also present plans on how they will achieve the photonic device performance required for implementation of their photonic network designs. Proposers will also be expected to demonstrate functional intrachip photonic communication links incorporating all critical photonic and electronic components/technologies working together on a chip and demonstrate link performance that validates the photonic network designs and the expected system performance benefits.
Proposed UNIC R&D should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, circuits, and computing systems.  Specifically excluded is R&D that primarily results in incremental or evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. 07-35, entitled Ultraperformance Nanophotonic Intrachip Communication (UNIC), is provided as an attachment to this solicitation notice and includes information on the specific areas of interest; the submission process; proposal formats; evaluation and selection/funding processes; as well as all other pertinent administrative and contractual information.

<DESC>Cross Indexing and Independent Referencing
Office of the Inspector General
Department of Transportation


I. STATEMENT OF WORK

This delivery order is to provide customized training on how to cross-index audit documentation and independent referencing procedures.  These duties include collecting and verifying information, preparing procedures/guidance for use by staff, drafting memoranda, and working successfully with staff from across the Office of Inspector General.  The training program will be conducted as a 1-day training session.   Participants are generally at the GS-13 level.  There will, however, also be more senior staff (GS-14 and GS-15).  3 sessions will be required this fiscal year.


A. BACKGROUND	

The Office of the Principal Assistant Inspector General for Auditing and Evaluation is the largest population in the OIG, numbering about 300 out of a total of 460 employees.    Primarily charged by the Inspector General Act of 1978 to conduct audits and produce reports of its work, this OIG now also produces a significant number of Congressional testimonies.  This office has also undergone the most significant changes in work demand and the type of work it does. Additionally, this office has gone through a recent reorganization.


B. OBJECTIVES

By the conclusion of this training course, the participants should understand the principles and the importance of referencing, the qualifications and requirements necessary to serve as a referencer, the referencer?s responsibilities, and the referencing process. 

The contractor will develop and provide training course materials and a qualified instructor necessary to conduct a training course in cross-indexing audit documentation and independent referencing procedures to OIG audit personnel.  The course will be 8-hours in length.  Course instruction materials will comply with OIG Operating Procedures Manual (OPM) requirements; primarily OIG OPM Chapter 2006, Audit Supervision; Chapter 2008, Audit Documentation; and Chapter 2010, Quality Control Over Report Preparation, as well as complying with general audit quality requirements contained in the Revised Government Auditing Standards (GAO Yellow Book).  

Instruction and training materials will include, but not be limited to (1) defining cross-indexing, (2) identifying what audit report material needs to be cross-indexed, (3) identifying when cross-indexing needs to be completed, and (4) how to perform cross-indexing procedures.  Independent referencing instruction and training materials will include, but not be limited to (1) defining the task and stressing its importance; (2) identifying the specific responsibilities of the independent referencer and the audit team; and (3) demonstrating how to conduct a thorough and complete independent referencing assignment, including resolving notes from the referencer (4) supervisor?s approval of the referenced material.  It is desirable for the vendor to understand electronic workpapers such as TeamMate.

Payment of services will be contingent on the OIG?s approval and acceptance of the (1) contractor?s finished course materials and, (2) qualifications of the instructor provided by the contractor.  Approval and acceptance of contractor work will be accomplished by the OIG Office of Training.

This session is to be completed no later than April 30, 2007.  Target class size is a minimum of 15 participants and a maximum of 20 participants per session.

C. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY

There are three elements of the training program:

1)	Consultation:  for a ? day, the contractor shall consult with the OIG Training Administrator to ask questions and clarify the goals for the training course.

2)	Preparation and Production:  2 days of preparation and production of materials to reflect work being done for the U. S. Department of Transportation, Office of Inspector General.  (One day of preparation is also provided to allow for modifications as dictated by the needs of the OIG.) 

3)	Training Delivery:  1 day of training for the course; course hours will be 8:30 am to 4:30 pm.
	
The training delivery shall consist of the following:

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Tara Petersen, 8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103, USAFA, CO 80840, 719-333-2074, Fax 719-333-9018, email: tara.petersen@usafa.af.mil     Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

<CONTACT>Bradley Penn, 937-904-7149
<DESC>FA8620-07-C-4020 Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) 1C/2C: This is a pre-solicitation synopsis. The Aeronautical Systems Center , 659  Aeronautical Systems Squadron intends to award a contract on a sole source  basis to Northrop Grumman Space and Mission Systems Corp. for the rapid  development, integration and testing of a fieldable, scaled, communication  intelligence system based on the ASIP architecture for the MQ-1, MQ-1X,  MQ-9 and RQ-4B (Block 30 I) Unmanned Aerial Systems.  The sensor portion  of the system will collect and process selected signals that are  classified up to and including Top Secret/SCI.  Specific requirements are  listed in Section 3 of the ASIP 1C/2C Systems Requirement Document that is  classified Secret/SI (available for review at Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio).  The Air Force Distributed Common Ground System will command and control  the ASIP 1C/2C sensors using interface standards established on the  baseline ASIP program. Northrop Grumman Space and Mission Systems Corp. is the sole designer,  developer, and manufacturer of the ASIP family of sensors and is the only  firm that possesses the necessary knowledge, experience and technical data  required to build these sensors in a timely and cost effective manner.  The anticipated design is a scaled version of the existing ASIP sensor and  requires minimal dollars and time to develop.  Planned spiral upgrade and  logistical support funding is insufficient to upgrade/maintain unique  solutions for these platforms and the existing ASIP systems so a single  architecture is required.  Developing a unique solution for these  platforms would result in duplication of efforts. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however,  interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond  to the requirement to the POC’s listed.  Information received will be used  to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The  determination to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this  notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Numbered note  22 applies. In accordance with recent Air Force Materiel Command Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement, the position of the ASC Ombudsman has been  terminated.  If any potential source has questions, comments or concerns  about this particular acquisition please direct all routine non-technical  issues to Mr. Brad Penn, Phone (937) 904-7149, e-mail:  bradley.penn@wpafb.af.mil and for technical issues contact Mr. John Frey,  Phone (937) 255-5999, e-mail: john.frey@wpafb.af.mil For more information on "Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP)  1C/2C SIGNET Sensor Development", please refer to:  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5215

The NAICS Code for this action is 541710, paragraph 11c which defines a small business as 1,000 employees. This draft solicitation for STS is for small business competition. SMC/PIK allows contractors to form teaming relationships for this effort.  Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, and 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions.  Industry responses, particularly from small and small disadvantaged business, will be used to evaluate the existing acquisition strategy.  The STS requirement is for the acquisition of technical services covering the following four core competencies: Systems Engineering, Specialty Engineering, Developmental Planning, and Support Engineering.  The ordering period under these IDIQ contracts is anticipated to be sixty months from date of contract award and the estimated ceiling value is subject to change.

In order to be eligible for award of a delivery order, additional Organizational conflict of Interest restrictions may be imposed by the government.  The contractor must possess, or be able to obtain, an Industrial Facility Clearance of Top Secret at the time of award. Personnel supporting activities under these IDIQ contracts must be US citizens and have a minimum of a secret security clearance. The contractor must have several personnel with Top Secret clearances to support requirements that may be awarded. The place of performance will occur at SMC, its Detachments or the contractor's facility.  Industry responses, particularly from small and small disadvantaged businesses, will be used to evaluate the existing acquisition strategy and the Government reserves the right to cancel one or both STS solicitations.  Potential contractors and other interested parties must obtain the Draft RFP and its associated attachments at Website http://www.fedbizopps.gov/index.html .

<DESC>The Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) is a DoD-wide Field Activity chartered in 1997 to support the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness – USD(P&R)).  The scope of DHRA’s mission is necessarily broad to provide the flexibility needed by the USD(P&R) to successfully explore and field new technologies and programs.  DHRA is responsible for programs that directly impact military and civilian benefits, readiness, recruiting and force protection areas throughout the Department.  DHRA programs are designed to provide better living and working standards for DoD military and civilian personnel, and to provide increased security in response to varied threat conditions.  The Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), a component of DHRA, is the central repository of DoD human resource information, both current and historic.  Its mission is to collect, provide and utilize this information for the benefit of decision makers in DoD and other government agencies and t!  he members of the DoD.  In order to provide this management support, DMDC requires technical assistance through cooperation with local colleges and universities at both DMDC locations (Arlington, VA and Seaside, CA).  Such technical assistance should take the following forms: Provide appropriately trained graduate students for studies and analysis. Provide faculty to supervise these graduate students and to perform advanced studies and analysis. Match faculty expertise to designated research needs. Provide research space (to include, when applicable, laboratory space) for the conduct of research required by the OUSD(P&R) program. Provide a pool of subjects for research studies where this is deemed necessary and mutually agreeable. In order for the above tasks to be maximized, the vendor must meet the following criteria: Established history (minimum 10 years) of working with a large number of universities and colleges nation-wide, and near both DMDC locations (Arlington, VA and Seaside, CA), and have access to these universities, colleges, students and faculty.  Typically, DMDC has individuals engaged on the contract as follows: 8-10 Faculty from various locations; 25-30 Students located in Seaside, CA; and 20-25 Students located in Arlington, VA. Established credentials and the capability of providing academic personnel for guidance and counseling students at both sites. Non-profit organization representing collective universities. NAICS Code:  541614.  The anticipated contract will be a Performance Based contract for a Base Year and four (4) 1-year options.  The solicitation may be requested in writing from Samuel C. Stringer at Contracts Department (Code 892) P.O. Drawer 43019, MCLC, Albany, GA 31704-3019 or via email at samuel.stringer@usmc.mil. This procurement complies with the Congressional and Executive directives to government laboratories to enter into close working relationships with universities, e.g., P.L. 97-86 (FY82 DoD Authorization Act) as codified at 10 USC 2360 and implemented in DFARS Subpart 237.73. Contracting Officer, Susan L. Wilson, Code 892, (229) 636-6741

In addition, to a main vehicle computer (MVC), which is capable of running statically defined missions provided by a mission planner, these vehicles will include a collocated PC-104+ PCU stack capable of providing vehicle control commands to the MVC in real time for fully adaptive, autonomous operation.  This PC-104+ stack will also contain the signal processing hardware for processing the acoustic array data in real time.  The acoustic modem, the acoustic array, and the PC-104+ stack will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment and will be integrated in the AUV.  Integration services are defined in a separate Statement of Work.  AUV specifications/capabilities are defined in a separate Technical Specification which includes some of the following requirements:  Size/weight/depth:  The AUV shall be man-portable (LOA < 2 m) and weigh less than 60 pounds in air, not including the weight of the acoustic array.  The AUV must be able to accommodate a payload consisting of an acoustic modem (described below), a 3-board PC-104+ stack and the addition of a side-scan sonar package at a later date.  The AUV must be capable of sustained operation at depths up to 80 meters.  Speed/maneuverability capabilities:  The capability to maintain course and depth control at a minimum speed of one knot while towing the acoustic array and with no array. The acoustic array will have a 12 meter active section which is 1.25 inches in diameter, a 10 meter cable lead-in and a small drogue.  The capability for maneuvering at low speed including the capability to allow a 180 degree turn in less than two vehicle lengths when the array is not being towed.  Endurance capabilities:  The minimum capability to run submerged at 2 knots for 10 hours while running the oceanographic sensor suite without the acoustic array. Assume a hotel load of 13 Watts for the PC-104 control CPU.  The desired capability to run submerged at 4 knots for 20 hours while running the oceanographic sensor suite without the acoustic array. Assume a hotel load of 13 Watts for the PC-104 control CPU board.  The minimum capability to run submerged at 1.5 knots for 4 hours with the acoustic array and sampling hardware in operation. Assume a hotel load of 33 Watts for the array, control CPU, and signal processing hardware.  The desired capability to run submerged at 2.5 knots for 8 hours with the acoustic array and sampling hardware in operation.

<ARCHDATE>04232008
<CONTACT>Kris Swofford Contracting Officer 4154645105 Kris_Swofford@nps.gov;
<DESC>The purpose of this project is to repair and restore wetland and fish habitat at nine sites, and develop habitat for the threatened and endangered red-legged frog at one site, all located within Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, CA.  Five sites will involve culverts which will be removed and replaced with concrete arch culverts, a box culvert, a multi plate arch culvert or a concrete bridge.  The majority of these culvert sites will also have streambed modifications requiring work to construct grade controls and grade control fish ramps, perform site dewatering, construct stream bypass structures and streambed revegetation.  This project must be viewed as a natural resource, fish passage opportunity, rather than a traditional construction project.  The challenges these project sites pose are unique.  Each site must be approached as a sensitive resource area allowing for minimum tree and vegetation damage.  Resource protection must be considered as a paramount emphasis driving the project.  In addition to protection considerations, the Glenbrook Crossing site has access constraints associated with working in a designated wilderness area. Work will be conducted at the following 9 sites: Mount Vision Road; Estero Road; North Home Ranch; Home Ranch; Glenbrook; Muddy Hollow; Limantour Beach; Upper Laguna and Lower Laguna.  The work to be conducted at these sites shall include all supervision, labor, equipment, materials and services to manage, sequence and complete work that includes: Removal and replacement of 6 existing culverts with two 16' x 6' concrete bottomless arches, an 8' x 4' concrete box culvert, a 16' x 6' 3-sided reinforced concrete culvert, and a 14' x 17' aluminum multi-plate arch culvert; Removal of existing road fill and installation of a single span metal bridge structure; Removal of a dam and installation of vegetated sediment detention facilities; Excavation of road fill and reconstruction of a stream channel; Installation of grade control and stream, stabilization structures; Stream diversion; Revegetation with native plant materials; Construction of temporary stream crossings; and Hydromulching and other erosion control measures as identified and described in the drawings and specifications to be provided.  This project is estimated between $1,000,000 - $5,000,000.  Due to natural resource issues, work may only be performed between the period of August 1 - October 15 each year with project completion required on or before October 15, 2008.  Award selection will be based on a Best Value determination made after consideration of price and factors other than price (previous experience, past performance, experience of key personnel, and other factors as outlined in the solicitation).  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available via electronic commerce only and may be accessed on/about May 10, 2007 at either http://www.fedbizopps.gov or directly through the DOI National Business Center website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  The due date for receipt of proposals will be 30 days after the date of issuance of the RFP.  The Contractor is responsible for periodically checking the website for any Amendments that may be issued prior to the closing date of the RFP.  This acquisition is unrestricted and is being pursued under full and open competition procedures.  The NPS welcomes the participation of small, minority, women, and disabled veteran owned business enterprises capabile of performing this type of project.  Interested parties may explore the Point Reyes National Seashore website to acquaint themselves with the general area or view park maps, if desired, at http://www.nps.gov/PORE.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) on behalf of the National Institutes on Mental Health (NIMH) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a non-competitive basis with William A. Corrigall of Ontario, Canada, for a continuation of services.
The contractor will continue to perform the following services: 
1)	Monitor, assess, and facilitate progress in the National Cooperative Drug Discovery Group (NCDDG) initiative
2)	Evaluation and Translation of progress in the Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center (TTURC). 
3)	Develop, Chair, and Deliver scientific meetings and workshops in the Nicotine and Tobacco Area that advance Division of Basic Neurosciences and Behavioral Research (DBNBR) program efforts, and represent NIDA program activities in nicotine addiction at scientific meetings
4)	Other efforts relevant to development of new funding initiatives in the discovery and early stage development domain for nicotine and tobacco addiction.

Dr. Corrigall has implemented major efforts in research that supports NIDA?s mission in drug addiction as it relates to tobacco which include establishing initiatives in translational and ligand discovery/development research. He has organized and chaired several NIH Roadmap initiatives. Dr. Corrigall also has over 25 years of experience in research on nicotine and tobacco. 
This sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills, and expertise that Dr. Corrigall possesses as a result of his successful research methodology. Because of his successful development and implementation methods, an award to any other source would affect the NIH/NIDA?s prior and current research involving nicotine and tobacco and would not provide a cost savings to the government.

The purpose of this proposed continuation is to support the NIDA Division of Basic Neuroscience and Behavioral Research (DBNBR) in sustaining activities in the nicotine and tobacco addiction research field in the areas of ligand discovery, disease mechanism discovery, and model development, and the translation of preclinical discovery to early stage development. This is a continuation of current purchase order 263-MI607534. This is a one year extension. 

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR Part13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.     Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.     The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization (PIAA) optics consisting of 2 aspheric mirrors, mounted on a single optical bench. The Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization (PIAA) coronagraph is a new optical concept which can efficiently remove starlight to allow direct imaging of much fainter sources very close to it. Its most promising application is to image planets like our own around other stars with a moderately sized space telescope. NASA is planning for a detailed laboratory test of this device, which requires the procurement of highly specialized PIAA optics as described in this document.	The L-3 SSG Tinsley Inc company uniquely has the capabilities to produce these specialized mirrors.  The PIAA optics consists of 2 aspheric mirrors, mounted on a single optical bench. The 2 mirrors work as a pair, and need to be designed and fabricated together. The PIAA mirrors will be part of a large vacuum testbed which will ultimately include a full optical train, from a large mirror (primary mirror) down to the focal plane detector(s).  NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from  L-3 SSG Tinsley, Inc The proposed contractor is the only company that has the extensive experience in manufacturing high accuracy optics for the astronomical community.  Tinsley brings a 77-year tradition of high precision optical fabrication to SSG. Their modern optical fabrication capabilities include high accuracy, deterministic grinding and computer controlled optical surfacing (CCOS), and precision profilometry and interferometry.   NASA intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract with L-3 SSG Tinsley Inc. under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  This request is considered to be sole source to L-3 SSG Tinsley Inc. therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.     The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on May 9, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<RESPDATE>061507
<ARCHDATE>06152007
<CONTACT>Dawn Rabunsky, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-0355, Fax 301-480-3432, Email drabunsk@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC>On behalf of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Westat, for the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS) Program, will be seeking proposals from all interested infectious disease test developers/manufacturers for refining, assembling, validating and obtaining FDA approval for HIV-SELECTEST EIA kits for distribution to national and international laboratories conducting Phase I-III HIV-1 vaccine trails. These kits will be used for distinguishing true HIV-1 infections from vaccine-induced HIV-1 antibody responses in study subjects.  Additional proposal requirements include plans for developing, refining, assembling, validating and FDA licensing a Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test based on the HIV-SELECTEST, which is presently being developed by FDA as a second generation HIV-SELECTEST.  For both tasks work will be conducted in two stages to include preclinical studies/test refinement, and clinical trials/test validation.     

For the development and subsequent manufacture of the HIV SELECTEST EIA kits contractors will be responsible for preparing, purifying and testing the HIV-1 synthetic peptides to be used in the HIV-SELECTEST.  There are four peptide sequences, two for Gag p6 and two for gp41 EIA.  Verification of the specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility of the EIA must be conducted using commercially available serological reference panels, clinical specimens from HIV-1 vaccine trials, specimens from studies deemed as false positives or indeterminate based on FDA-licensed serological kits and Western Blot kits, specimens from HIV-1 epidemiological evaluations, and other studies with infectious agents relevant to HIV-1 infection.  Pre-clinical sensitivity and specificity study requirements for an IDE will be provided.  Comparison and stability studies to define the sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and robustness of the HIV-SELECTEST EIA in detecting acute HIV-1 infections will be required.  For clinical trials/test validation, the contractor will be expected to ship and distribute kits to up to 20 national and international clinical laboratories supporting HIV-1 vaccine trials, which will conduct clinical testing of specimens obtained from Phase I-III clinical trials.  In conjunction with this, in-house parallel testing of 10-15% of these specimens being tested by clinical laboratories is required for QA/QC compliance, and assessment of results variability across laboratories, variability across kit lots, and kit stability.  Finally, the contractor shall submit an IDE application to the FDA.     

Plans for the Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test should include refinement of the assay.  Given that this assay is presently being developed by FDA scientists as a second generation HIV-SELECTEST, the technology will be transferred to the contractor following the award.  Contractors will be required to compare the performances of the HIV-SELECTEST EIA, the Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test, and current FDA approved HIV-1 tests.  These comparison studies will test clinical specimens in parallel with participating Regional and Primary Diagnostic testing laboratories supporting HIV-1 clinical trials.  To conduct the comparative studies the contractor will develop an External Quality Assurance program containing Standard Proficiency Testing Panels.     

This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition.  It is anticipated that one award will be made for a period of 3 years.  THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IS NOT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP); the Request For Proposals must be downloaded from the Westat Web Site, and will be available on or about April 30, 2007 at the following internet address:  www.westat.com.  The estimated due date for proposals is June 15, 2007.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Aerojet Ordnance Tennessee, 1367 Old State Rte 34, Jonesborough, TN 37659.  AFRL/MNMW desires to purchase one (1) Tungsten Alloy Bar for material property evaluations and testing.  In order for the overall material testing program to have validity and continuity, it is critical to use the same material as was used in previous tests.  This is further mandated as the current materials have been mechanically strengthened and heat treated to the same conditions as previously tested materials.  In order to change vendors, it would require that previous penetration tests be reaccomplished and additional quantities of materials be purchased.  The current alloy, mechanical processing and heat treatment have the optimum balance of strength, toughness and ductility.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.     Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC).  Submit SOCs within 15 days of publication to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNK), Attn: MiMi Martin, 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810.     Please refer technical questions to Morris Dilmore at (850) 882-9644 and contractual questions to MiMi Martin at (850) 883-2675.     An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors.     The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.     When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.     The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.     Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting points of contact identified above.     The Ombudsman is Sue Hunter; her phone number is (937) 904-9700.  Numbered Note 26 applies.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION


1.  Contracting Activity.  

The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Jacksonville 

2.  Description of the Action Being Approved.  

This is a sole source action to be conducted under the authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items, (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  This sole source action is to restrict the provider of camera maintenance services for nine (9) Government-owned cameras to FLIR Systems, Inc. the manufacturer of the cameras, due to the proprietary data for this equipment.

The proposed action is a follow-on contract for maintenance services acquired under contract N68836-06-C-0046.  A firm-fixed contract is anticipated.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.  

The proposed acquisition is for general maintenance services for nine (9) Government-owned surveillance cameras utilized by the Security Department at SWFLANT, Kings Bay, Georgia for surveillance of high security areas, to include the grounds surrounding the Nuclear Weapons area.  The nine cameras were manufactured by FLIR Systems, Inc. and include the following model and serial numbers: Sentry with Joystick Control and Breakout Box/13520105, 13520106, 13520107, 13520108, 13520186, 13530084, and 13530129; and Ranger cameras/21628, 21631.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD), on behalf of the Optical Technology Division, Low Background Infrared (LBIR) Facility, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of  41 USC 253 (c)(1), with DRS Sensors and Targeting Systems, Inc. of Cypress, CA, for blocked impurity band (BIB) detectors.   

The LBIR facility is in the process of developing a standard radiometer that is capable of calibrating infrared radiative powers from 10 nW to 1 picowatt to an uncertainty of less than 0.1% of the measured signal.  In addition, the radiometer needs to have a long wavelength cut-off limit of 32 micrometers that matches that of transfer radiometers that are currently in use within the LBIR, or will be in use in the near future. 

To achieve this goal, the LBIR facility intends to procure discrete BIB detectors that will be arranged in a trapping configuration such that surface reflections from one discrete detector would land on the active area of another discrete detector until more than 99.99% of the incident radiation has been absorbed.  In order for such trapping radiometers to perform as scientifically defendable National Detector Standards, the discrete detector elements must have a quantized response with an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of greater than 99% over the specified wavelength range.  

This requirement is for BIB detectors that will be used to create the trap detector.  The requirement is for the delivery of approximately 50 packaged BIB detectors, and the delivery of approximately 200 other BIB detectors that have not been packaged. The final number of delivered BIB detectors will be variable depending on the optical properties of samples measured during the fabrication process.

DRS is uniquely qualified to provide the required detectors.  DRS has extensive experience with BIB detectors.  DRS manufactured the BIB detectors that are currently in use at the LBIR facility and continues to manufacture detectors which have less stringent specifications than those required to satisfy the specifications of this procurement.  DRS has devised a modification scheme to reach new specifications that BIB detectors have never before been able to reach.  Based on extensive market research, DRS is the only known manufacturer that can provide these detectors.  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by May 9, 2007, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

It is anticipated that the proposed Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be  available on FedBizOpps imminently.  Interested, responsible institutions  (offerors) will have sixty days to respond with proposals upon issuance of  the BAA. The proposed BAA provides an opportunity for Academia within the set-aside  institutions to explore and develop specific areas of science and technology  (and their applications to these specific areas) which are of interest to the  U.S. Army.  There are a total of four research topics within three Science and  Technology areas that have applications of interest to the U.S. Army at this  time: â€¢	Armaments Science & Technology Area: Ballistic Impact Dynamic Modeling of Fabric for New Protection Systems:   Develop innovative design tool for evaluating the performance of fabrics that  will be used in improved protection systems against current and future threats. â€¢	Battlespace Awareness Science & Technology Area: Innovative Intelligence Agent and Cognitive Decision Aids Component Technology  for Net Centric Fires: Develop real time intelligent agent based algorithms and reusable code  components that can provide the basis for developing the next generation of  intelligent, network centric fires management, execution and control software  for Future Combat System applications. Target Image Transformation and Transfer: Determine a methodology to resize, transform, compress and transfer the image  of a target and associated reference points from a Fire Control system to an  autonomous small caliber projectile and store the image in the projectile. â€¢	Novel/Directed Energy Science & Technology Area:  Hybrid Soldier Power Source: Develop novel concepts for methods and devices to harvest electrical energy  during locomotion for hybrid power systems for soldiers.  The power must  provide a power source that is safe and light-weight.  The power source must  not provide a thermal signature, be cumbersome, increase fatigue or interfere  with the free movement of the user. The overall objective of the proposed BAA is to create relationships with the  targeted Institutions and introduce the aforementioned Institutions to the  technology trends available at the U.S. Army Research, Development and  Engineering Center.  Although these concepts are considered basic research, it  is desirable to mature these concepts for possible future programs. No responses to this notice are required.  The purpose is only to advise  interested colleges, universities, and institutions within this set-aside  procurement of the intent of the Department of the Army to introduce a BAA on  the aforementioned topics at the time frame cited in this message.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) Acquisition Center-Washington, on behalf of Project Management-Command and Control Systems (PM-CCS), Countermine Division, plans to negotiate a sole-source contract wit h Gyrocam Systems, LLC for spares and repair parts for the Gyrocam Triple Sensor Camera System in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The Gyrocam Triple Sensor Camera is a vehicle mounted high resolution camera s ystem with day vision, night vision, and thermal imaging capabilities.  When combined with a zoom capability, this camera system significantly improves the force protection of warfighters by enabling identification of explosive targets at greater stand-off  distances.  The Gyrocam Triple Sensor Camera is installed on RG-31 Mine Protected Vehicles (MPVs) and Joint Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) Rapid Response Vehicles (JERRVs).  The camera system allows a vehicle to move over rough roads or at high speeds  while steadily displaying images inside the vehicle.  Spare and repair parts, to include assemblies, sub-assemblies and components, are needed to enable expedited repair of battle-damaged camera systems and, therefore, enable rapid return of the camera sy stem to the field. The Contractor will provide spares and repair parts including assemblies, sub-assemblies and components for the Gyrocam Triple Sensor Camera System.  The vehicles the sensors are mounted on are blown up by explosive targets on a daily basis, repaired and p laced back into service, often within the same day.  The spare parts particular to the Gyrocam Triple Sensor Camera will be needed to repair the camera system in case of failure or down time and fielded again for use. It has been determined that Gyrocam Systems, LLC is the only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy the agencys requirements.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1); Only One Responsible S ource and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the required Gyrocam Triple Sensor Camera System spares and repair par ts may submit a parts list with a corresponding quote that will be considered by the agency.  The resultant contract will be a three-year Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract.  Responses are to be received via E- mail within 15 calendar days of the date of this notice.  All requests for further information must be in writing via E-mail.  Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.  You may forward responses to the following E-mail address:  A ndrew.Chappell1@us.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Government seeks, through the solicitation and award of a design-build contract, a remedy for a hurricane and flood related problem in Orleans Parish. This Pre-solicitation notice provides to the potential proposers a broad overview of this procu rement.  The notice explains the overall problem the Government desires to remedy through this procurement, explains the Governments approach to the procurement, provides general information on the method of selection, and outlines how the Government plan s to make key technical data available to the proposers. The problem is the lack of adequate protection provided by the existing hurricane protection on the IHNC and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway /Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (GIWW/MRGO) to the areas adjacen t to the IHNC and the GIWW/MRGO from a design storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico through Lake Borgne and Lake Pontchartrain.     Scope of Work The work will require that the contractor provide 100-year flood protection from waters coming from the Gulf of Mexico, through Lake Pontchartrain, and through Lake Borgne, and the GIWW/MRGO.  Minimum flood protection provided shall be the 100-year water h eights and wave loading, design parameters that will be provided by the Corps of Engineers.    The protection will be based on future conditions for the year 2057 for all designs.  The protection system may be in the form of levees, floodwalls, floodgates, some combination of these, or some other innovative method.  The existing flood protection in the construction region shall not be compromised or degraded without prior approval.  Design and the sequencing of construction elements shall not increase the potential risk of interim flooding beyond existing conditions.  Factors of safety and stability of all protection systems shall comply with the most recent applicable U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Criteria.  The affect of waves, both vessel and wind generated, shall be included in all designs.  The flood protection shall be designed for minimum operat ion and maintenance costs.  This includes design and construction of various hurricane and flood control measures meeting the requirements that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will furnish to the short-listed firms. The US Army Corps of Engineers has split the project into two separate requirements: one to protect the IHNC and GIWW/MRGO from a 100-year frequency storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico through Lake Borgne into the GIWW/MRGO and the second to protect the IH NC from the water heights and waves generated by the same storm on Lake Pontchartrain.  We will issue the advertisement for the second requirement at a later date to be determined.  This pre-solicitation only pertains to the first requirement to protect th e area from storm surge entering the IHNC from the Gulf of Mexico through Lake Bornge, and the GIWW/MRGO.   Approach and Selection   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is confident that the design-build delivery approach will save time, and generate holistic, innovative solutions to the problem above.  The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to procure design-build services by means of FAR  Part 36; Subpart 36.3 Two-Phase Design Build Selection Procedures method.  In step one, a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) will be issued, and from the respondents Statement of Qualifications (SOQ), select a short-list of three, but not less than two, an d no more than five firms.  In step two, the design-build Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued to the short-listed firms to request their proposed technical approach, design, and associated price.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will select a singl e technical approach based on a Best Value selection process.  The initial RFP will be a Draft RFP.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is interested in using short-listed firms input to improve its RFP, and currently the plans are to issue the draft RFP to  short-listed firms, followed by a pre-proposal conf erence.  The US Army Corps of Engineers will then issue the final RFP. To encourage innovative solutions to the stated problem, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will not prescribe a design but rather provide key technical data and design criteria to the shortlisted firms.  The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers has previously util ized the services of an Architect-Engineer (A-E) firm to develop a conceptual framework of possible solutions to verify that there is a solution to the problem.  The US Army Corps of Engineers is also developing environmental data for the areas including c onsideration of some of the possible alterations that may occur to the areas with a protection plan chosen from the proposers.  This data and the conceptual plan will be made available to proposers for their use in preparing their bids.  The task of select ing the best technical approach and optimizing that approach is left to the proposers.  The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers however, has no particular bias toward any particular technical approach previously considered.  It remains the responsibility of the proposer to collect any additional data they determine necessary to develop their technical approach. While the RFP selection criteria have not been fully developed, at a minimum the following factors are currently under consideration:  technical approach, management team, experience, O&M costs, proposed schedule, and price.  The contract type is cost-reimbursable plus an award fee.  It is in the best interest of the Government to have a contractor or contractors on board early in the design-build process. Response Please indicate interest as a potential offeror (prime or joint venture partner) to this planned procurement by responding to Karen Golden via letter or e-mail at: U. S. Army Corps of Engineers                         Contracting Division 		ATTN:  Karen Golden 		HPO, Rm 184 		PO Box 60267 		New Orleans, LA 70160-0267 		Karen.golden3@mvk02.usace.army.mil		 The Government invites your comments and concerns to this planned procurement, as described above.  The Government values and will consider all input received, however, we do not intend to respond directly to each comment.

<DESC>NEW RESPONSE DATE FOR PHASE 1 ------BUILDING 31 CONSTRUCTION.  This announcement is for a fixed-price design/build contract for construction of a new building of approximately 31,000 gross square feet to house laboratory, support services and administrative functions on the campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana.  This acquisition is being conducted on behalf of NIH by the Indian Health Service, Division of Engineering Services (IHS/DES) under an interagency agreement pursuant to the Economy Act.  The building footprint is nominally 68’x138’ with basement level, two full stories above ground, and a mechanical penthouse.  The exterior appearance and floor plans are defined.  The building is conceived as a steel frame structure with exterior combination of brick and metal panels.  The design and construction will include completion of all design details, connections to central campus systems (including steam, regular and emergency power, chilled water, communications, and security access), equipment requirements, finishes, and furnishings for a complete functional structure.  Specialized requirements include adherence to National Institutes of Health Design Guidelines, vibration isolation, noise mitigation and blast damage resistance.  The work includes demolition of three existing buildings, including one that occupies the new building site and two that will be demolished approximately 30 days after acceptance of the new building. The demolition will involve hazardous materials.  Offerors will be evaluated using Two-Phase Design/Build Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that will result in an award based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The general dollar magnitude of the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The estimated period of performance is eighteen months.  Responses to phase one of this procurement will consist of relevant experience (example projects); past performance; key personnel; general technical approach; quality control program; and representations and certifications.  The information will be evaluated and up to five firms may be selected to submit technical and price proposals in phase two.  Phase one evaluation factors include past performance, experience, capacity, and quality.  Phase two evaluation factors may include quality of overall management plan, including phase one elements; technical solution responsiveness and quality; and price.  Price and the overall technical rating are of approximately equal weight.  Evaluation of price may involve total price or evaluation of scope/design options within the published budget for award.  The phase two technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, small business subcontracting effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.   Phase one of this solicitation will be issued on or about 17 April 2006 and will be posted on this website.  Phase two will be issued to the short listed offerors after evaluation of phase one responses. Firms formally organized as design-build entities or design firms and construction contractors that have associated specifically for this project may submit proposals. In the latter case, a single design firm or construction contractor may offer more than one proposal by entering into more than one such association.  This solicitation is being conducted on an unrestricted basis.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.   Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database in order to participate in this procurement (http://www.ccr.gov).

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of DataTrax System.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Kentucky Consular Center’s (KCC) Alternative Processing Center (APC) is responsible for maintaining a viable operational environment for a growing number of Consular Affairs (CA) mission-critical systems.  Although the Center has been able to maintain a high level of facility readiness for these mission-critical systems through thoughtful planning, a growing number of unscheduled events are being addressed through a reactive process and not a proactive process.  This scenario is of great concern to CA management because the number facility management support personnel are largely fixed and system monitoring tasks, that are performed manually, are prone to human error. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. KCC facility management personnel researched available solutions and determined that an automated monitoring system, that would proactively notify facilities management personnel before a problem occurred, was required to maintain the required level of facility reliability at KCC.  After reviewing  market offerings, KCC facilities management personnel determined that the DataTrax system currently deployed and being used by the State Department’s IRM Division in Washington, DC was the best overall monitoring system for the KCC APC.<BR><BR>That system is attractively priced (see attached), has the required functionality, and can be integrated with the existing IRM system as part of an enterprise monitoring solution.   This DataTrax system maximizes the availability of essential mission-critical IT, communications and process systems by:  ·	Simplifying and managing electrical, environmental, and life/safety equipment from one system ·	Providing a total package with complete software, hardware and installation services for APC systems ·	Enabling capacity planning, instantaneous failure prediction and trend analysis ·	Providing a solution that scales to the needs of the KCC APC ·	Managing all the interfaces required at the KCC and providing an intuitive graphical interface that accurately depicts potential failures.<BR><BR>With the criticality of the Appalachian Processing Center’s support to CA/VO, DHS, Fraud Prevention, Facial Recognition, and now Passport services, we cannot afford to have equipment failure.  The intent is to increase the abilities of FMS services so that we may remain pro-active in our response and not reactive.  With the DataTrax system in place at Main State, equipment failures have gone to zero in a 7 year time line.<BR><BR>

<DESC>***Modification to reflect a change in the square feet requirement.  13,299 rentable square feet yielding 11,564 useable square feet.***

The U.S. Government is seeking to lease approximately 13,299 rentable square feet yielding a maximum of 11,564 ANSI/BOMA area square feet of contiguous office and related space for a build to suit in League City, Texas.  Lease term will be for fifteen (15) years, ten (10) years firm.  Space must be situated within the following delineated area:

North:  Main Street aka HWY 518
South:  FM 646
East:   FM 270
West:   I-45

Space must be located in a Class "A" environment, with attractive, prestigious surroundings with a prevalence of modern design, tasteful rehabilitation in modern use or new construction.  Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety and handicapped accessibility, and be located outside a 100-year floodplain.  All services, supplies, utilities, and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.  Site offered must be large enough to accommodate sixty (60) on site parking spaces for visitors and employees, with the employee parking being secured and separate from visitor parking.  A 20 foot setback is required from the face of the building's exterior to the protected/defended perimeter (i.e., any potential point of explosion).  This would mean the distance from the building to the curb or other boundary protected by bollards, planters, or other street furniture.  Such potential points of explosion may be, but are not limited to, such areas that could be accessible by any motorized vehicle, such as street, alley, sidewalk, driveway, parking lot, etc.

Sites which are located directly on a highway or 6-lane thoroughfare shall not be considered in the following instances:  (1) if the two directions of traffic are separated by a physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within a block; (2) if the location access is directly from a highway, unless there is a traffic control device within two blocks or equivalent from the proposed office space.  Locations must be as convenient to the visiting public as possible.  Primary consideration in selecting boundaries will be accessibility by public and private transportation for the greatest number of people in the service area.  

In cities with public transportation, the service must be at regularly scheduled times during the entire workday and within 600 feet (or two blocks, whichever is less) from the building entrance for the commuting needs of the visiting public.  The route from the bus stop to the building entrance shall be accessible for the mobility impaired.

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building's ownership.  Subleases are not acceptable.  

If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM EDT, May 7, 2007.  

All expressions of interest for unimproved sites should be in writing and include the following:

1.	Provide specific location of the proposed site including site plan and location map.
2.	Provide total available acreage and proposed acreage.
3.	Name, address, and telephone number of individual to be contacted.
4.	Evidence of authority to represent the owner.

AUTHORIZED CONTACTS:
In no event shall the offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning the space to be leased with representatives of any Federal Agency other than the officers and employees of General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative.

Address all replies to Authorized Representative of the General Services Administration (GSA) at:

<DESC>* This posting is to correct an error with the estimatd ordering period for the agreement.  The estimted ordering period of the BPA is 18 months and not 4 months as initially posted.  A corrected notice follows:

The United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, Office of Wetland, Oceans & Watersheds (OWOW), Assessment and Watershed Protection Division (AWPD) is seeking to enter into a Blanket Purchase Agreement for contractor support for laboratory services in support of the National Lakes Survey project.  The National Lakes Survey project assessment is being undertaken to generate statistically valid estimates of the biological health of lakes across the country. Tasks under this requirement will include: (1) Conducting laboratory analysis of phytoplankton populations including identification and enumeration using a specific methodology that was adapted from the- Protocol for the Analysis of Algal Samples collected as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Water-Quality Assessment program (Charles et al., 2003).  This methodology involves microscopic examination of preserved phytoplankton samples collected.  Laboratories must use the inverted microscope method as described in the Survey of the Nations Lakes Laboratory Methods Manual (LMM).  Sample preparation, necessary materials and equipment, and analytical procedures are described in the LMM.   (2) Adhering to the strict quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) requirements of the EPAs Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP).  (3) Providing logistical support by receiving, logging and storing field samples received.  (4) Adhering to sample tracking procedures and ensuring that the reporting of all required data, calculations, and results is accomplished within the designated times, on the designated forms, and is submitted via any designated data management system.   The successful small business laboratory will receive pre-labled samples on a regular basis during the project period.  Preserved samples are to be processed, enumerated, and identified (at the 300 organism level), with the exception of diatoms, to the lowest possible taxonomic level (generally genus) using agreed upon standard keys and references.  The contractor shall also maintain a reference library/voucher collection using digital imagery.  The EPA anticipates awarding a single Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) under this solicitation.  The BPA will establish a fixed rate for each sample analysis.  The BPA will establish an ordering period of eighteen (18) months.  Over this eighteen month period, EPA estimates a total of between 1150 and 1300 analysis will be required.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) require an offeror certify that it is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or disclose any potential conflict of interest which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the solicitation.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after BPA award will also be a part of the solicitation.   THIS REQUIREMENT IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The applicable NAICS code is: 541380 with a size standard of $11 million.  The projected start date is June 1, 2007.  The solicitation is expected to be posted to FedBizOpps on or about May 2, 2007 as Solicitation Number PR-CI-07-10632.  No hard copies of the solicitation shall be provided.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the FedBizOpps website for updates or changes.  All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  See Numbered Note: 1.

<DESC>*This posting is to correct an error in the estimated ordering period expressed in the initial notice.  The estimated ordering period of the BPA is 18 months and not 4 months.  A corrected notice follows:

The United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, Office of Wetland, Oceans & Watersheds (OWOW), Assessment and Watershed Protection Division (AWPD) is seeking to enter into a Blanket Purchase Agreement for contractor support for laboratory services in support of the National Lakes Survey project.  The National Lakes Survey project assessment is being undertaken to generate statistically valid estimates of the biological health of lakes across the country. Tasks under this requirement will include: (1) Conducting laboratory analysis of zooplankton populations including identification and enumeration using a specific methodology that was adapted from the ?Sampling and Analytical Procedures for GLNPOs Open Lake Water Quality Survey of the Great Lakes, USEPA, Great Lakes National Program office (February 2003), and Lake Michigan Mass Balance Methods Compendium, USEPA, Great Lakes National Program Office (December 1994).  This methodology involves microscopic examination of preserved zooplankton samples collected.  Laboratories must use the methods as described in the Survey of the Nations Lakes Laboratory Methods Manual (LMM).  Sample preparation, necessary materials and equipment, and analytical procedures are described in the LMM.   (2) Adhering to the strict quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) requirements of the EPAs Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP).  (3) Providing logistical support by receiving, logging and storing field samples received.  (4) Adhering to sample tracking procedures and ensuring that the reporting of all required data, calculations, and results is accomplished within the designated times, on the designated forms.  The successful small business laboratory will receive pre-labeled samples on a regular basis during the project period.  Preserved samples are to be processed, enumerated, and identified, to the lowest possible taxonomic level (generally genus) using agreed upon standard keys and references.  Basic sample processing steps include sieving, sorting, identifying, measuring, and counting (at the 300 organism level).  Instructions are provided in the Manual for microcrustacean stratified splitting and enumeration, rotifer and nauplii sub-sampling, Sedgwick-Rafter preparation and rotifer enumeration, archiving both microcrustacean and rotifer samples, along with general analysis guidelines.  The contractor shall also maintain a reference library/voucher collection using digital imagery.  The EPA anticipates awarding a single Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) under this solicitation.  The BPA will establish a fixed rate for each sample analysis.  The BPA will establish an ordering period of eighteen (18) months.  Over this eighteen month period , EPA estimates a total of between 1150 and 1300 analysis will be required.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) require an offeror certify that it is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or disclose any potential conflict of interest which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the solicitation.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after BPA award will also be a part of the solicitation.   THIS REQUIREMENT IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The applicable NAICS code is: 541380 with a size standard of $11 million.  The projected start date is June 1, 2007.  The solicitation is expected to be posted to FedBizOpps on or about May 2, 2007 as Solicitation Number PR-CI-07-10633.  No hard copies of the solicitation shall be provided.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the FedBizOpps website for updates or changes.  All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  See Numbered Note: 1.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to delete the statement (I don't have an electronic copy of the draft COI clauses to post with this synopsis)" from the following sentence:  A draft copy of COI clauses (I don't have an electronic copy of the draft COI clauses to post with this synopsis) to be included in the solicitation can be found at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.   The draft copy of the COI clauses is available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  All other guidelines outlined in the synopsis remain unchanged.   The Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to provide support for the ambient air monitoring and quality assurance program in support of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), Central Operations and Resources.  The ambient air monitoring and quality assurance program focuses on issues concerning implementation and operation of national, state/local, and tribal air monitoring networks.  In addition, the program addresses the quality of the measurement data of the criteria air pollutants (carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), lead (Pb), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and various sizes of particulate matter (PM10, PM10-2.5, PM2.5), chemical speciation of particulate matter, air toxic compounds, and ozone precursors required to be measured by the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) program.  A principal objective of EPA=s monitoring and quality assurance role is to ensure that the quality of the data collected and reported by state/local/tribal agencies, federal agencies, and other parties, can be quantified and can be used to support programs such as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the federal reference and equivalency program, and the nation=s air quality management programs. Solid technical support is critical to the U.S. EPA=s ability to support air quality management policies and programs, as this support will directly impact federal, state, and local air quality monitoring activities. The efficient use of air quality data to obtain useful and defensible environmental protection results is also an important concern for EPA.  The development and application of statistical techniques to meet this need involves areas, such as trends analysis, data screening, risk assessment, model performance evaluation, and comparisons with respect to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  Key considerations in the successful implementation of these techniques are not limited simply to the validity of the statistical assumptions, but must address the feasibility of employing the technique, the practicality of implementation and how the underlying statistical framework relates to existing methodologies.  In some cases, it may be necessary to develop and assemble alternative environmental indicators to help explain air quality trends and to reconcile these trends with emissions, modeling, health, and ecological information. The Contractor shall provide support for the U.S. EPA=s ambient air monitoring and quality assurance programs including, but not limited to, the associated federal regulations and policies, outreach activities, technical guidance, field activities, special studies,  program and quality system development, statistical support, desktop publishing support, web site design and operation and data retrievals.  The contractor shall provide the necessary labor, material, facilities, and expertise required for the performance of the following tasks:  Task 1. General Technical Support; Task 2. Development and Revision of Guidance Documents and Technical Reports; Task 3. Facilitate Assessments and Audits; Task 4. Outreach Activities; Task 5. Conference, Seminars, and Workshops; Task 6. Cost Estimates;  Task 7. Completion of Special Air Quality Studies; Task 8.  Data Quality Objective (DQO) Development and Program Support;  Task 9. Regulatory Support; Task 10. Statistical Support; Task 11. Desktop Publishing Support; Task 12. Precision and Accuracy Program; Task 13. Data Retrievals.   The total duration of the proposed contract is sixty (60) months.  The government anticipates the award of a cost plus fixed fee, level of effort type contract with a base period of performance of twelve (12) months, with four (4) additional twelve (12) month option periods.  The contract will be awarded on the basis of full and open competition and will consist of 10,000 base quantity labor hours and 65,000 optional quantity labor hours for each of the five (5) periods, for a total contract maximum of 375,000 labor hours. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620  with a size standard of 6.5 million.  The anticipated contract award date is October 1, 2007.   This effort is not a follow-on effort.  The solicitation is scheduled to be issued on or around May 14, 2007 and proposals will be due thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date.  A draft copy of COI clauses to be included in the solicitation can be found at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd. The solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd    If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments. The Government is not obligated or committed to award any contract as a result of this notice.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA requires that any fingerprint scanner must meet the following software compatibility requirements: -Must utilize an IEEE-1394 PC interface for high speed and efficiency of processing. -Must be able to read images from an Oracle database. -Must be able to process the image and store the results into an Oracle database. In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner requested without delay so that the pilot testing required for the verification of field functionality can commence as scheduled.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system.<BR><BR>CA/CST requires the Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner for use with US visa programs.  Recently, the Homeland Security Council mandated the capture of all 10 fingerprints of visa applicants for whom US Consular officials receive information that indicates that they may have US law enforcement records.  On June 7, 2005, the Homeland Security Council decided as follows: "It should be the policy of the United States Government that biometric screening of foreign visitors to the United States be based on a fingerprint standard requiring 10-print capture at enrollment and 2-print verification thereafter."  The Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner meets the following requirements: -The scanner must be able to function as a drop-in replacement for the Smiths Heimann LS/2 Check fingerprint scanner and must perform at least as well as the Smiths Heimann LS/2 CHECK fingerprint scanner. -The scanner must be evaluated against the current Ten-Print Capture Scanner and Software Requirements specifications. The Cross Match L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. · Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) · CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting · 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives · Systems must have front video/USB ports · Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources · Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  These servers will be supplementing the set of HP ProLiant DL380G5 servers that are already in use onsite.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Request For Information (RFI) On Earth Observing System (EOS) Data and Information System (EOSDIS)Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) Operations NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for the operation of the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. The EOSDIS SAR DAAC is currently located at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF).  The SAR DAAC is required to acquire, process, archive and distribute very large volumes (estimated to reach at least 100 Terabytes/year) of remote sensed SAR data to research scientists, governmental entities and the public that apply this physical information to understand and solve major problems in the Earth Sciences, such as global change, environmental monitoring, agricultural inventory, geology, hydrology, ice sheet movements, polar change detection, etc. The ESDIS Project is interested in awarding or renewing a contract for acquiring and archiving SAR data at a facility that would work cooperatively with the ESDIS Science Operations Office (SOO) and the Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs).  The contract will be “Cost No Fee.”	The functions of the SAR DAAC would include, but are not limited to:  1)	Direct interaction with universities or research institutes that use SAR data. 2)	Direct ingest of raw signal data from US or foreign ground stations.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with L-1 Standards and Technology, Inc., 209 High St., New Windsor, MD 21776 for a Cryogenic Radiometer Control System.  
NIST requires an updated electronic control system for the development of new capabilities for the High Accuracy Laser Power and Energy Meter Calibration Service.  To this end, NIST is developing a new cryogenic radiometer with greater flexibility and performance than the current device the Laser Optimized Cryogenic Radiometer, which was built by Cambridge Research and Instrumentation Inc. (CRI) in the mid 1990's.  This is a multi-year project, with component purchases made as funding and manpower allow.  NIST will purchase the electronic control component for the cryogenic radiometer, and a test version of the optical absorber cavity which will likely be used in the subsequent design. These new components must be compatible with the existing LOCR cryogenic radiometer and the new L-1 Standards and Technology Inc. cryostat which was purchased in FT 2006.  Therefore, L-1 is the only responsible source for these components. 

The electronic control system consists of two functional parts, electronic temperature regulation circuits, and electrical power measurement circuits.  Two sets of each are required, one set for the cryogenic radiometer's heat sink, and one set for the radiometer's optical absorber cavity.  The new electronic control system must meet the following requirements:

I.  Digital temperature control electronics which include two independent four-wire AC temperature measurement bridges for resistive temperature sensors and heaters, which meet or exceed the following:
A.  Proven performance improvements over the existing CRI TC-02 temperature controllers.
B.  Regulated temperature stability of better than 1 micro-degree Kelvin.
C.  Support for the current TC-02 temperature control's 3-term parabolic interpolation algorithm, with added flexibility to use conventional PID loop parameters and feed-forward techniques, all accessible to the end user through program control.
D.  Programmable AC bridge operating frequencies to avoid interference.
E.  Operating power range from 0 to 100 mW.

II.  Two independent digital power measurement electronic circuits for precision measurement of the electrical power applied by the temperature controllers, which meet or exceed the following:
A.  Proven performance improvements over the existing CRI TC-02 power measurement circuits.
B.  Power measurement resolution of better than 1 pW.
C.  Power measurement accuracy of better than 5 ppm at 1 mW.
D.  Temperature stability of better than 1 ppm per degree Centigrade
E.  Power measurement range from 0 to 100 mW
E.  System calibration and verification hardware using built-in standard reference resistors.
F.  Calibration certificates for the standard resistors.

III.  Mechanical enclosure box for the control electronics that is compatible with our existing, proprietary CRI and L-1 cryostats, and mounts to the bottom of the cryostat.

IV.  Independent low-noise power supplies complete with the cables required to operate the control electronics, and uses 120V, 60 Hz line power.

V.  All electrical components must be contemporary and currently manufactured, so that replacement parts are readily available.

VI.  Complete documentation in both printed and searchable electronic forms.

VII.  Complete operating software compatible with Windows XP Pro and LabVIEW, which includes both executable programs and source code.

We also require a test version of the contemporary Cryorad-IIb optical absorber cavity.  The cavity will be used for optical testing of novel coatings being developed at NIST, including a new carbon nanotube coating.  We are considering using a functional version of the Cryorad-IIb cavity in our new cryogenic radiometer, depending in part on the outcome of our optical tests.  Obtaining the test version of the cavity will allow us to evaluate the design without having to purchase the much more expensive functional version.  Since the Cryorad-IIb is a proprietary design produced only by L-1 Standards and Technology Inc, there is no other source for the device.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K). This synopsis is issued for information only. No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement.  Respondents must provide sufficient documentation that address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any questions regarding this notice shall be submitted in writing (e-mail preferred) no later than close of business May 9, 2007. Anticipated award date is May 10, 2007.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, and Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky.

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Custom Packs. The estimated total volume for this region for this product line is $320,756. This is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. 

At the request of the Heartland Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.


C.	Instructions to Offerors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937)257-9075 before 4:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement in order to remain competitive.
This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before 4:00 P.M. EST on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement in order to remain competitive.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Heartland Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.
Phase I. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. After review of technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in Phase II, the clinical/performance evaluation. All technical/company criteria are equally weighted.
Phase II. The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be non- clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Samples must be received by COB at 4PM local time, 21 calendar days after request. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.
Specific MTF?s will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert like one to five rating scale. One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are equally weighted. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 
Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region. Vendors who fail to offer discounted prices will be disqualified from RIA award consideration.
Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  
 

1. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT, THIS ACQUISISTION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZONE, VOSB, AND SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.   THE INTENDED NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES OR LESS.    

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is seeking sources for an intended re-competition of its contract for a Drug Testing Facility (DTF). This project is currently being performed by BIOQUAL, Inc. of Rockville, MD.   

Background and Acquisition History

The Drug Testing Facility of the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) has been a mainstay of much of the CRHB's operations for over thirty years. The Drug Testing Facility currently screens hundreds of submissions annually for classical endocrine and anti-fertility activity and establishes potency ratios (in terms of standards) for those that exhibit significant effects. They have developed methods for determining the duration of hormonal activity following oral, subcutaneous and topical (transdermal) administration, which has been of enormous value in the assessments thereof. Over 40000 compounds, formulations and drug delivery systems from government, private, international organizations and contractors world-wide have been evaluated since the project was initiated in the early 1970's.

The Drug Testing Facility undertakes a variety of over 150 screens, assays, safety tests and analytical laboratory procedures. Theses efforts provide the CRHB with unparalleled capabilities for the evaluation of new drugs, formulations and delivery systems. The results of these various tests are used to guide new synthesis efforts, modifications of formulations and dosage forms. They are also used for the evaluation of optimal bioavailability or studies on the duration of activity, which may be used to provide support of clinical investigations through various safety studies.

This subject acquisition will require the successful offeror to provide this level of expertise in all of the areas developed to date and possibly new areas yet unrecognized. Offerors will be encouraged to provide an alternative proposal that incorporates novel methods of testing.

 
Description of the Services

The Drug Testing Facility (DTF) assays hundreds of submissions annually for classical endocrine and anti-fertility activity and establishes potency ratios (in terms of standards) for those that exhibit significant effects. The facility also develops methods for determining the duration of biological activity following oral, subcutaneous and topical (transdermal, transvaginal, etc) administration. It evaluates the potential clinical utility of new compositions of matter and formulations thereof.

Under NICHD contract, the DTF evaluated submissions that originated from private, university, governmental and non-profit organizations throughout the world. Many submissions also were derived from other NICHD contracts or collaborative programs. A Compound Submission Form is completed by the originator for each compound when the material is provided to the Project Officer. Compound identification, physiochemical properties, purity and analytical data are requested with each submission, whenever available. The decision of whether or not to include the material for testing in the DTF is made by the Project Officer in consultation with other staff of the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The Project Officer provides the Contractor with the test sample and a copy of the Compound Submission Form. Frequent contact between the Project Officer and the Contractor allows advanced notice of compounds expected for testing.

The DTF must be capable of performing a wide range of screens, assays, safety tests and analytical procedures for the evaluation of new compounds, formulations and delivery systems. The results of theses tests may be used to support patent applications by submitters, as well as the CRHB, NICHD. As new technologies become available, the facility must be capable of incorporating new and innovative assays/tests into their portfolio (either in house or through subcontracts) to meet the needs of CRHB.

The DTF must be capable of performing and providing at least the following competencies:

1.  Toxicology studies, including acute, subacute, subchronic, chronic, reproductive and genetic, may be undertaken in-house or through subcontracts.

2.  Rabbit vaginal irritation testing for the evaluation of formulations of spermicides and microbicides to include both gross and histopathological examination of external genitalia and cervix. Services of a board certified pathologist are required for performance of both gross and microscopic examinations. This test is usually performed under "Good Laboratory Practices" (GLP) Guidelines so that, if necessary, the results may be submitted to the FDA in support of a Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Drug (IND) initiation of clinical investigations. New compounds and/ or formulations must have an IND before clinical work can proceed.

3.  Contraceptive efficacy tests are required to predict clinical activity of potential contraceptives. Dose-response and time related efficacy curves must be provided for comparison with various standards.

4.  Growth and maintenance of cell cultures for the conduct of in vitro assays required for evaluation of compounds. Theses assays include, but are not limited to, transfection of specific cell lines with estrogen and progesterone receptor expression plasmids and appropriate reporter constructs. These in vitro tests will permit a more thorough exploration of tissue-specific effects of a number of steroids, their antagonists, and other compounds exhibiting antifertility activities. 

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement for consideration. Address how your company is able to meet the above four competencies. Please email your capability statements of 10 pages or less in a Word document to Katharine Minker at minkerk@niddk.nih.gov.  No additional information regarding the upcoming RFP is available at this time.  Please do not telephone or email the Contract Specialist seeking additional information.  A pre-solicitation notice will be posted that will advise when the RFP will be released.  

Your response, composed of a brief cover letter and completed Capability Profile, should be submitted via E-mail, FAX, or mail, within 21 days of the date of this publication, to:

<DESC>Provide Professional A/E Services for Project #692-333, entitled "Replace Dom Building 218" at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center &amp; Clinics, White City, Oregon.  This project involves architectural, structural, electrical and mechanical work involving the demolition of existing 18883 GSF brick two story bldg with 6500 GSF of two story connecting corridor and replacing with the construction of a new single story domiciliary bed building and connecting corridor of approximately 19,000 GSF on the site.  New building will be predominately bed space to accommodate approx. 50 beds but will have some corridor and office space.  This new building is the third of four new buildings and the first two buildings (B215/216) set the design schematic for all of these buildings.  The A/E may use the government furnished AutoCAD drawings and specifications from the previous buildings design to minimize re-design, maximize productivity and to maintain the architectural, interior design (all aspects unless otherwise noted including but not limited to all finishes and room configuration and placement), many of the structural, electrical, fire alarm and suppression features.  The A/E may use the typical drawing details, the building layout for this design and the applicable specifications.  This does not relieve the A/E from providing the Government with an accurate and clear design.  The A/E shall evaluate the previous building designs in specific areas of (1) Landscaping - no vehicular access to this building is required; (2) Mechanical - HVAC.  The existing design locates the HVAC system in the attic and on a flat roof (chiller).  The VA is interested in life cycle cost reductions for this system and is requesting the A/E review alternatives for placing the HVAC system on the ground (inside or outside).  There are many incidental items related to the HVAC layout such as the extensive sound attenuation, steel ladder access, structural components, etc.  (3)  Increasing the number of single occupancy rooms with private baths.  The building configuration shall be such to allow for separation of landscaping, wings, or certain room sections to allow for the VA the required 20% in bid alternatives.   Services will include Phase I involving the preliminary investigative services and general building layout and orientation; Phase II involving the preparation of contract drawings and specifications for construction bidding purposes, with electronic format submission after completion of Phase II; and Phase III will be for construction period services and site visits during actual construction.  Evaluation factors to be considered will be (1) Specialized experience in Health Care Facilities of the firm with similar contracts; (2) Past record of performance on similar contracts; (3) Geographical location and facilities of the working office; (4) Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to this project.  Estimated construction cost range is between $5M to $10M.  NAICS: 541310/Size Standard: $4.5 million.  This is a set aside for service disabled veteran owned A/E small businesses.  Firms interested and desiring consideration shall submit Standard Forms 330 by close of business May 29, 2007 to the Contracting Officer shown above.  Award is pending availability of funds.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT and not an RFP.

The government?s intent is to do a modification to contract number FA4890-06-F-0054 (NAICS: 541511) to Tactical Communications Group on or about 1 June 2007.

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Kentucky Consular Center’s (KCC) Alternative Processing Center (APC) is responsible for maintaining a viable operational environment for a growing number of Consular Affairs (CA) mission-critical systems. Although the Center has been able to maintain a high level of facility readiness for these mission-critical systems through thoughtful planning, a growing number of unscheduled events are being addressed through a reactive process and not a proactive process. This scenario is of great concern to CA management because the number facility management support personnel are largely fixed and system monitoring tasks, that are performed manually, are prone to human error. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. KCC facility management personnel researched available solutions and determined that an automated monitoring system, that would proactively notify facilities management personnel before a problem occurred, was required to maintain the required level of facility reliability at KCC. After reviewing market offerings, KCC facilities management personnel determined that the DataTrax system currently deployed and being used by the State Department’s IRM Division in Washington, DC was the best overall monitoring system for the KCC APC.<BR><BR>That system is attractively priced (see attached), has the required functionality, and can be integrated with the existing IRM system as part of an enterprise monitoring solution. This DataTrax system maximizes the availability of essential mission-critical IT, communications and process systems by: · Simplifying and managing electrical, environmental, and life/safety equipment from one system · Providing a total package with complete software, hardware and installation services for APC systems · Enabling capacity planning, instantaneous failure prediction and trend analysis · Providing a solution that scales to the needs of the KCC APC · Managing all the interfaces required at the KCC and providing an intuitive graphical interface that accurately depicts potential failures.<BR><BR>With the criticality of the Appalachian Processing Center’s support to CA/VO, DHS, Fraud Prevention, Facial Recognition, and now Passport services, we cannot afford to have equipment failure. The intent is to increase the abilities of FMS services so that we may remain pro-active in our response and not reactive. With the DataTrax system in place at Main State, equipment failures have gone to zero in a 7 year time line.<BR><BR>

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<br>

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance: <br>

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. <br>

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations," Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at
<http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/> or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web
site at <http://wdol.gov/>.<br>

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)} <br>
Conformance Process: <br>
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed. <br>

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: <br>

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation) and computes a proposed rate). <br>

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage
rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work. <br>

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). <br>

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request. <br>

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. <br>

6) The contractor informs the affected employees. <br>

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. <br>
When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.<br>

Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for: Title: Thrust Vector Control Breadboard (BB) Hydraulic High Pressure Instrumentation Requirement Document Point of Contact: Syreeta Stewart, syreeta.j.stewart@grc.nasa.gov, (216) 433-8673, Thomas Kraft; thomas.g.kraft@nasa.gov; 216-433-2936 Date: 04/24/2007 Synopsis: NASA, Glenn Research Center is charged with developing the Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system for the Upper-Stage of the new ARES I launch vehicle.  As part of this program we will be building a hydraulic breadboard system to evaluate the TVC hydraulic system components. The overall goal of the breadboard testing is to evaluate the functionality of each hydraulic system component (both steady state and dynamic), determine if each hydraulic component is adequately sized, and to see how all the hydraulic components operate when integrated into a complete TVC system. In order to characterize the hydraulic system, NASA GRC will require pressure, flow and temperature measurements throughout the system. NASA GRC would like to have the pressure, temperature and flow instrumentation integrated together into one single mounting block assembly to simplify the integration of the instrumentation into the hydraulic system. This entire assembly, which includes the instrumentation mounting block, the pressure sensor, temperature sensor and flow sensor will be named the “instrumentation assembly” for the remainder of this document.	Below are the basic requirements for the instrumentation assembly.  General Requirements for Instrumentation Assembly 1.	Instrumentation Assembly Definition: As mentioned in the synopsis, vendor shall provide a mounting block along with the pressure, temperature and flow measurement sensors integrated into the block.

The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Acc ess Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main  Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.      Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street G ate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.    (c) If the Fast Access Gate  Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.    (End of  clause)  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:   a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A f ast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or wh o do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30  days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.   The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.   b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor em ployees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access id entification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any  reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.     c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identifi cation badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verball y, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements o f this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any  clause of this contract.    d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verb ally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within on e (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of t he outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.   f.  The contractor shall, upon expir ation or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges  have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and whic h gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.  (End of clause)   Local clause 52.111-4133 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtained by cal ling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  The following procedures apply if the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated or expires.  See the clause entitled Commer cial Vehicle Access To Fort Lewis  Fast Access Gate Program.  Commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and the D Street Gate.  The Logistics Center Gate is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (to include federal holidays).  The D Street Gate is open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays, from 0530-2130.  These gates are open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection.   In the event both the Logistics Center Gate and the D Street Gate are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate. All commercial vehicles will be searched.  A visitor pass must be obtained.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also  allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon a s possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 clearance) will require a time stamped  searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 in height and that they will requi re access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them fo r access to North Fort Lewis.  (End of clause)  Addendum to Clauses 52.111-4131, 52.111-4132, and 52.111-4133  States:  Employees who require access to Fort Lewis to perform work under this contract may obtain a Government sponsored identification badge.

<DESC>Questions and Answers:

1.	The proposed contract title refers to skilled technicians and the Background section discusses a skilled technician.  Is the requirement for one or more than one technician? 
There are two positions.
2.	We note that the contractor will be limited to working 240 days per year, some of which may be Holidays.  Will the ATF provide "fill in" personnel during the times the contractor is not working?  In the event of illness or unexpected injury to the contractor technician,  who will provide coverage of his or her duties? 
A illness one/two days ? we cover ? any longer that the contractor would have fill with a contractor technician ? with a clearance. 
3.	The requirement states:       The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is contracting for a skilled technician with specialized knowledge and ability in the care, safe handling, and health management of canines.    Section 5, descriptor "L" discusses landscape beautification.  This is an entirely different labor category than an Animal Caretaker/canine care technician.  Canine care personnel are typically specialists in their field and do not normally perform landscape activities under contracts for canine care.  Please elaborate on the expectation of what is to be provided under "landscape beautification" activities. 
This requirement would include grass cutting and weed trimming of the canine exercise areas.
4.	How many canine technicians support the current program, and what are their qualifications? 
            Four            
5.	Are any certifications required for the contractor's skilled technician who must possess the specialized knowledge and ability in the care, safe handling, and health management of canines?
            No
6.	What type of vehicles/trailers are used to transport the canines, and will the contractor?s employee be required to obtain a GOV license?  If so, will training be provided by ATF to qualify the individual?
The canines are transported in cargo vans that are outfitted with plastic shipping crates. The contractor will need a valid driver state drivers license. 
7.	Are uniforms, boots, shoes, rain gear, gloves, hats and safety equipment provided by ATF?  Are uniforms required?
ATF will provide hats, t-shirts, and sweat shirts with a ATF Logo on them. All necessary safety equipment will be provided by ATF to include eye and ear protection as well as protective aprons. The contactor will be required to purchase navy blue BDU pants and black work boots.  
8.	What are the requirements for physical exams (e.g.: CBC, audiogram, TB test, etc?)  How often are physical exams required (e.g.: annually, every three years, etc.)?  In the event of a canine bite or other accident, is there a medical treatment facility on the kennel site location? 
There are no requirements for physical exams. In the event of a canine bite or accident the contractor would be transported to Warren County Hospital which is approximately five miles from the kennel. 
9.	What type of security clearance is required?  (we base this question on the "Background Security Requirements" section, as follows: "The contractor is encouraged to fill all positions with employees who have recently been the subject of a Limited Background Investigation (LBI), Background Investigation (BI), or Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and/or who possess a Top-Secret clearance, or a Secret clearance based on a LBI or BI."
A Secret Clearance is required
10.	Will the contractor employee be expected to attend outside training programs at the contractor's expense to maintain and/or gain the specialized skills that are or may be required?
At this time the contractor will not have to attend outside training. The contractor will be required to complete mandatory on-line training. This training must be completed annually and will cover the following topics:  Ethics, Sexual Harassment, Information Security, and Americans with Disabilities.
11.	What type of chemicals and equipment (e.g.: steam cleaners, cold water pressure washers, etc.) are used to disinfect the kennels?
The kennel has a integrated high pressure disinfected system, each kennel bay has numerous disinfected hose line that carry a premixed disinfected.
12.	Who provides leashes and collars for the dogs?
ATF will provide leashes and collars
13.	Is bathing of dogs performed indoors or outdoors?  
The canines are bathed indoors; the kennel has four walk-in stainless steel bathtubs.
14.	Is a site visit possible prior to the solicitation closing?
No
15.	What type of maintenance is required?  Please provide examples.  
Minor kennel repair  for example: Hose repair, kennel doors, fence repairs.
16.	Is there a government (or contracted) maintenance crew to support major maintenance?   
            Yes   
17.	Who provides the tools for maintenance of the kennels and other Training Center facilities?  What are the other facilities?
ATF will provide all necessary equipment required accomplishing the mission; The other facility would be the ATF Canine Training Building which is located 1.5 miles from the kennel.  
18.	Is travel part of the requirement for procurement and training support ("M" and "N")? If so, will the contractor be reimbursed for those travel costs?
The contractor would have to pay out of pocket for any travel and then would be reimbursed for the travel cost via a Standard Form 1012. Per Diem and Lodging would be paid based on the travel location.

1)  I know previously, a county business license was required -- I don't see that on this particular item.  Is it still required? No
 
2) I have obtained a DUNS number.  Can the CCR wait until the contract is awarded, or does
it have to be on the proposal? At time of award the contractor must be registered in CCR.
 
3)How does one obtain a solicitation cover sheet SF1449? The SF1449 is not required for contractors to complete as far as submitting their proposals. No speacial form is required it is up to the contractor on what form they what to submit their proposal on.
 
4) Basically -- what is the procedure for a novice at government contracts to submit a proposal?  I have downloaded all of the FARS info, but it is pretty confusing for anyone not familiar with contract procedure. In the solicitation tells the contractor what to provide to us as far as submitting their proposal.

Question 1:   The user is asking for Raid 1 on the servers, but requesting 5 hard drives.  The controller will only do raid 0 and raid 1 and RAID 1 is usually only meant for 2 drives (not 5)

The workstations are asking for 5 hard drives in some cases and a DVD +/-RW and a DVD/CD-RW. You cannot have 5 hard drives and 2 optical drives in a workstation.

Response:1) The Server Configuration does not ask for 5 Hard Drives, the Servers (Configuration 1) have 4 Hard Drives per Server.  Also on the Servers there was no RAID Setting Specified.

2) Per the HP Specifications Web Page, the xw9400 Chassis has three External 5.25" Drives bays suitable for Optical Drives and 5 3.25" Hard Drive Bays.  Therefore he needs to provide some documentation that it won't work.  While we did not include his quote in our Market Research because Sandra Broadnax got all over us for even talking to a Large Business, we did ask him for pricing on this order and he quoted these configurations.

3) On no configureation is RAID 1 Specified, therefore his comments concerning RAID 1 have no relavance.  There are some workstations that have heterogenious drive mixes, so the following is what is desired:

Config 1: 3xDL385-4 Hard Drives each
 -- No RAID Specified

Config 2: 1 x xw9400
 -- 4x146GB Drives - RAID 0
 -- 1x750GB Drive  - No RAID

Config 3: 5x xw9400
 -- 5x 750GB Drives - RAID 0

Config 4: 4x xw9400
 -- 2x146GB Drives - RAID 0
 -- 3x750GB Drives - No RAID

Config 5: 4x xw9400
 -- 2x146GB Drives - RAID 0
 -- 3x750GB Drives - No RAID
