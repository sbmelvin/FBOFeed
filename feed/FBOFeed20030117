<DESC>This will be a firm-fixed-price type contract for Amplifier Subassembly applicable to the ALR-56C system; NSN: 5996-01-230-8672; P/N: 319751-00. Basic Qty: 2 First Articles; 27 Production Units. Mission Essential Quantity (MEQ): 30 Production Units.  Option I: 1-89 Production Units. Option II: 1-89 Production Units.  
This is a competitive requirement with an Insurance Policy Buy for the MEQ to the proven source, BAE Systems, Yonkers, N.Y. 
This acquisition will be processed in accordance with AFMC FAR Sup 5352.217-9006 (Award of MEQ): The Government has determined that a break in the supply of this item (that is, failure to deliver due to timeliness and/or conformance) would jeopardize support to operational units' mission capability. Additionally, the item is of such complexity and/or so critical that first article testing measures are required for all unproven sources to ensure that the unproven source is capable of producing a conforming part. Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award the MEQ and, if necessary, the remaining balance of the requirement, to a proven source. In such event, the proven source must be a responsive, responsible offeror and also be the lowest in price of all proven offerors, price and price related factors considered. Therefore, two contract line items are provided to correspond with each of the two alternatives.  
The approximate solicitation issue date will be 7 Feb 03, with the approximate response date of 7 Mar 03.  Request solicitation from Don Howard, WR-ALC/LNKB, 265 Perry St, Robins AFB, GA, 31098-1607; email don.howard@robins.af.mil.  Solicitation will be posted on the Web at http://pkec.robins.af.mil.

Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, may apply.  Numbered Note 22 applies only to the quantity identified as the MEQ.  See Note(s) 22, 26.

<DESC>Overview

A.  Introduction

USAID(s) Strategic Goal Three, human capacity built through education and training,includes two Agency objectives and two cross cutting emphasis areas relating directly to the development of human resources.  The first Agency objective under Goal Three is expanded access to quality basic education for under-served populations, especially girls and women.  This Agency Objective is directly supported by USAID(s) Office of Education within the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade (EGAT/ED).  The Strategic Support Objective (SSO) 1 of EGAT/ED is improved and expanded basic education, especially for girls, women and other under-served populations.  The agency(s) basic education programs include activities aimed at (1) improving the access, quality, efficiency, and equity of formal and non-formal education systems at pre-primary, primary, and secondary education levels, (2) adult basic education programs for literacy and numeracy, and (3) training for teachers working at these levels.  Please see EGAT/ED(s) web site for more information (www.usaid.gov/educ_training).

EGAT/ED(s) strategic framework under SSO1 includes six intermediate results that reflect the technical objectives, leadership skills, and field support capabilities of EGAT/ED in basic education.  The fourth of these intermediate results, EGAT/ED(s) IR 1.4, focuses on education data: improved accuracy, timeliness and accessibility of data for basic education policy and program planning.  Education data are important both in Washington, D.C. for agency planning, programming, and reporting, and in the field as USAID Overseas Missions usually work more directly with developing countries to improve education systems.  Thus, any award to support EGAT/ED(s) intermediate result for improved education data must also be able to support USAID Missions needs surrounding the collection, analysis, dissemination, and use of education data.

USAID(s) current education data activity, DHS EdData (www.dhseddata.com), has been the primary mechanism by which EGAT/ED has worked towards improved education data by:  1) providing a supplementary source of data that is accurate, timely, accessible and relevant for developing country and USAID education policy and program planning, monitoring and evaluation; 2) facilitating the use of the data collected; 3) building in-country capacity for education data collection, analysis, and use; and 4) contributing to the improvement of international education statistics.  USAID EGAT/ED is interested in continuing these types of activities under a new contract titled EdData II.  This new contract aims to build on the experiences, results, and lessons learned form DHS EdData.

B.  Purpose

The purpose of EdData II is: (1) to provide basic education data, analysis, and reports from nationally representative surveys and smaller scale assessments, qualitative and quantitative, to guide developing country education policy making, program planning, monitoring, and evaluation; (2) to calculate education indicators; (3) to build in-country capacity for education data collection, analysis, dissemination, and use; and (4) to contribute to the improvement and standardization of international education statistics.  It is expected that data and other outputs of the contract, such as reports and technical meetings, will be accessed and utilized by host country governments, USAID, multilateral institutions, other donors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as universities.

1.2. The Subcontractor will be provided with the SSI output consisting of static nodal accelerations representing the building seismic response, which defines the seismic loads.  These seismic loads shall be combined with other non-seismic loads to determine the design forces and moments on the structural elements of the buildings using the GT-STRUDL finite element analysis.  Sufficient code checking shall be done of primary structural members to assure that the buildings will withstand the critical load cases.  
1.3. Performing foundation analysis for the buildings.
1.4. Performing a tornado wind and tornado missile analysis for the buildings. 
2. Deliverables: Subcontractor shall provide calculations and results of the structural analysis including appropriate sketches in accordance with BSC's procedures, and schedule.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Bechtel Nevada is looking to partner with a leasing company to provide financing for heavy construction and maintenance equipment. We wish to understand the leasing process of your company, options available and restrictions or requirements you may have in partnering with us. Our partner would handle all leasing of the specified equipment for the Nevada Test Site operations.

Bechtel Nevada is the contractor for DOE/NNSA managing the Nevada Test Site. This relationship is referred to as a GOCO, Government Owned Contractor Operated relationship. Bechtel Nevada operates under a letter of credit from DOE/NNSA where all contract related payments are drawn against the letter of credit. Bechtel Nevada is paid an annual fee for their management services and does not have an equity stake in the operation. 

Our interest is primarily in Operating Leases, however, if Capital Leasing can be proved viable we would also be interested in discussing those options.

<DESC>REF A: Strategic Plan for Transforming DOD Training, March 1, 2002, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Director, Readiness and Training Policy and Programs
REF B: MIL-PRF-29612B Performance Specification, Training Data Products
REF C: DI-SESS-81517B through DI-SESS-81527B Data Item Descriptions (DIDs)
REF D: MIL-HDBK-29612-1A through 5A Guidance for the acquisition and fielding of training systems
I. BACKGROUND: Training Transformation, mandated by OSD in REF A, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DODs new ?system of systems? environment. As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes. Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process. Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter or a similar forcing function construct to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing. Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of key performance parameters throughout the acquisition process.        
II. PROBLEM: The Performance Specification (REF B) and associate DIDs (REF C) do not address Human Systems Integration (HSI) and are inadequate in their treatment of human capability and performance. The guidance for acquiring and developing/providing training products/services in REF D is similarly deficient. Moreover, REFs B, C and D need to be updated to reflect best business practices, latest technology and standard industry terminology related to fielding effective human performance-oriented training. III. ANTICIPATED CONTRACT: NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for revision of REFs B, C, and D, (and additional volumes if required) and training support in their use. NAVAIR Orlando anticipates awarding an indefinite quantity/delivery type contract to the selected Contractor. A single source will be selected to ensure seamless integration of best practices across the volumes. The Government anticipates a Not-to-Exceed $5M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as firm-fixed price/cost plus fixed fee delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract.  IV. RESEARCH REQUIRED: Prior to product development, market research must be conducted of best business practices concerning relevant research and emerging processes related to Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT); incorporation of HSI factors across those processes; insertion of technology; and acquisition of effective human performance-oriented training. Of special interest is embedded training; interactive multimedia instruction; advanced distributed learning; distributed mission training; media analysis and analysis of alternative training systems (including cost-benefit); human performance measures; and verification and validation of computer-based courseware. Analysis must be conducted to evaluate the potential for application of the identified best practices within REFs B, C, and D. V. CAPABILITIES REQUIRED: Successful performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of and experience with REFs B, C, and D. The ability to synthesize identified best business practices into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements will be essential.  The joint services ISD/SAT and training acquisition policies emerged out of long-term debates within the Defense Training System Working Group (DTSWG) to arrive at consensus on best practices. Accordingly, participation with the DTSWG in that deliberative process and development/revision of the documents will be weighted factors for source selection.  In addition to the research requirement, the required capabilities include 1) Human Systems Integration; 2) Human Systems Engineering; 3) Training requirements front end analysis; 4) Human Performance analysis; 5) Americans with Disabilities Act compliance 6) Measurement and evaluation of training effectiveness; 7) Media Analysis of latest technology; 8) Cost-benefit analysis; 9) electronic performance support systems; 10) IMI/ADL SCORM production process; 11) Weapons and training systems acquisition; 12) Systems Engineering. VI. PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS: The Government will require the contractor to provide highly skilled and experienced personnel in specific disciplines to meet the professional and technical requirements listed above. VII. SUBMISSION OF A CAPABILITIES STATEMENT: This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing the information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.

NOTE: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY MODIFICATION TO THE SOLICITATION.  PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN MODIFICATION TO THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The purpose of this modification is to: (1) Provide answers to the following questions received through January 17, 2003:  QUESTION NO. 1: Is web-based training being considered as a delivery method?  More specifically, would you consider having existing training materials developed into an e-Learning format?  ANSWER NO. 1: Since the MOV course is "Hands on" intensive requiring a shop to support the disassembly and subsequent re-assembly of MOV's Web based training is not applicable.  QUESTION NO. 2: The Course outline focuses on actuator training.  By contrast, the Performance Requirement Summary focuses on NDE and makes no mention of actuators.  Should the course content include both actuator and NDE training or only actuator training?  ANSWER NO. 2: The reference to NDE should be substituted with MOV. (2) Extend the due date for receipt of questions to February 5, 2003. (3) Extend the due date for receipt of proposals to February 12, 2003.

<RESPDATE>021503
<ARCHDATE>04162003
<CONTACT>Kathleen  Harris, 520-295-6938
<DESC>NA DESC This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI), by the Air National Guard Air and Space Directorate, Requirements Division to determine sources and refine requirements for an Advanced Radar Warning Receiver (ARWR) for F-15A/B/C/D aircra ft.   The Air National Guard intends to procure a replacement for the ALR 56-A RWR currently in place on Air National Guard F-15 A/B/C/D aircraft.   The market information gained as a result of this RFI will help define system requirements and the acquisit ion plan.  For the purposes of the RFI, no constraints of RWR configuration are levied except as noted in the following requirements: 1.  The RWR shall have the capability to search, detect, identify, track, and display Radio Frequency (RF) waveforms/threats, along with the capability to incorporate new threat systems. 2.  The RWR shall have these capabilities against both air and ground based emitters including RF agile threats and left, right, and circularly polarized threats.   3.  The RWR should be displayed on the current RWR Scope. 4.  The RWR needs to have azimuth accuracy at/near +/-0 degrees and have elevation capability with similar accuracy as azimuth. 5.  The response time of the future system should be near instantaneous.  6.  The future system should have a BIT matrix and fault detection system. 7.  The future system should have a very low false alarm rate (e.g. unknowns, ambiguous IDs, extraneous/spurious signals, etc).   8.  This advanced RWR should include a Mil-Std-1553 bus interface to allow integration with the Multi-Purpose Color Display (MPCD) and Joint Mounted Helmet Cueing System.   9.  This RWR should be capable of integration with the current Internal Countermeasures Set (ICS) and Countermeasures Management Dispenser (CMD).   There are several future growth capabilities for this RWR that may be incorporated into the RWR at a later date.  Some of these capabilities include:   1.  Integration with Tactical Electronic Warfare Suite (TEWS) upgrades.  2.  Integration with future CMD upgrades. 3.  Integration with future Radar improvements and upgrades to include V3 or equivalent radar. 3.  Generation of RWR tones to the appropriate earphone in the pilots helmet that correspond to threat direction. 4.  The capability to threat geolocation and specific emitter identification.   This RWR must be able to meet the ruggedized/environmental demands of prolonged high-G flight (-3Gs to 9Gs), and extreme temperature and humidity changes.  The RWR will not require any structural modifications to the aircraft and must fit in with existing structures.  Any wiring additions or changes will have minimal impact on the existing aircraft electrical systems.  Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) parts shall be used as much as possible.  User manuals shall be furnished to include maintenance manuals, wi ring diagrams, parts breakout, and a set of drawings.  Interested parties capable of producing a RWR which meets or exceeds the above requirements shall provide a Statement of Capability (SOC) that demonstrates the existing capability to produce, modify an d sustain the system as described above; and a description of system capabilities.  The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify system capability as related to the technical effort requested above.  No s olicitation exists at this time and the Air National Guard does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  The SOC is limited to 15 pages in Office 98 Word or Power Point format and must be rece ived not later than 15 February 2003.

The GSA FSS Support Services Division (FCXC) is requesting information on efficient methods for administering Continuing Education Unit (CEU) credits at GSA SmartPay conferences.  CEU credits are not presently available at these conferences.  The conferences provide training to approximately 3,000 government charge card program managers and officials.  Over 220 training courses were offered at the most recent conference.  Attendance at individual training sessions ranges from as few as 10 to as many as 200 participants per session.  GSA FCXC intends to establish CEU credits for training courses at future GSA SmartPay Conferences.  GSA FCXC is familiar with the requirements for establishing CEU credits for individual training courses and will not require information in this area.  However, GSA FCXC would like to gain a better understanding of the methods or systems available for capturing and reporting CEU credits for conference attendees, particularly those that are highly automated and do not present an unreasonable burden on conference attendees.  Vendors with a capability to provide this information are encouraged to submit by January 31, 2003, product or system descriptions regarding capture and reporting methodologies, general pricing information so that FCXC can estimate associated costs, and brief background information about your company to the following address:  GSA FSS FCXC, Attn:  Ms. Rachael Stevens, Crystal Mall 4, Room 507, 1941 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202.  Alternatively, this information can be provided via e-mail to rachael.stevens@gsa.gov.  This is a request for information and not a solicitation.

The main base size is approximately 1,668 acres with a separate small arms range (Camp Keller) of 1,886 acres. The site includes 1,370 buildings and 1,953 family housing units. The electrical distribution system is a 23 kV distribution system with three incoming feeds. One substation (1-5 MVA 23 kV to 13.8 kV) serves the west family housing areas and one (2-7.5 MVA 23kV to 4.1kV) serves the installation hospital. Peak demand is 32,997 kVA (89% power factor) and the annual consumption is approximately 165,950 MWh. The primary distribution includes: 132.5 miles split evenly between overhead and underground lines. Secondary distribution system includes: 111 miles of lines (85% overhead and 15% underground). Approximately 3000 street and area lights (20% residential and 80% commercial/industrial). The natural gas distribution system is approximately 386,000 linear feet of primary steel pipe (90% steel, 10% PPE) ranging in size from 1 inch to 8 inches. System is in good condition, 90% of the pipe is over 40 years old. Gas is supplied at 125psig and regulated (via 5 government owned regulators) to facilities at 25 psig. Annual consumption is 464,440 MCF. There are nine government owned meter facilities. The water distribution system includes twelve wells (six currently in service), and six elevated storage tanks with a capacity of 400,000 gallons each. Pumping capacities range from 500 to 1000 gpm, with pump motors ranging from 60 to 125 horsepower. 95 miles of 2 inch to 10 inch pipe and additional small service lines. Average water use is 3 million gpd. Chlorination and fluoridation treatment are provided at the main base wells. Two independent systems provide irrigation water for the golf course. One is from a pond maintained by storm water runoff and base supply wells and the other is tied directly to the base water distribution system. A small well and hydropneumatic tank serve the off-base small arms range (Camp Keller) No treatment is provided at the small arms range. Wastewater system consists of approximately 445,400 linear feet of pipe and 10 lift stations containing a total of 20 pumps. System is evenly split between gravity flow and force mains.

Description
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the electrical, natural gas, water distribution and wastewater collection infrastructure systems at Vance Air Force Base, Enid, Oklahoma The electrical distribution system at Vance AFB is through a single 69-kilovolt kV transmission line into a substation located on the north end of the installation, west of Hairston Gate.  The 69 kV transmission line feeds a 69/12.47kV, 7500 KVA transformer.  The 12.47 kV distribution level voltage is fed underground to an electrical switching station, which is adjacent to the OG&E substation but is owned by the Air Force.  The electrical distribution system consists of five 12470/7200 volt three-phase feeders.  The distribution system consists of approximately 78,000 linear feet of underground service and an estimated 25,500 linear feet of overhead service. The natural gas distribution system is supplied to the base by Oklahoma Natural Gas Company via a single four-inch 200 psi supply line which is master-metered at the base perimeter. The distribution system consists of approximately 13 miles of underground main which is normally maintained at 16 psi; the main lines are all wrapped and coated steel pipe with cathodic protection. The water distribution system utilizes water supplied by the City of Enid via a single 10-inch main at approximately 60 psi. The base supply main carries water to a 300,000 gallon ground storage tank; water is pumped from there into a 500,000 gallon, 110 foot elevated storage tank. Water is distributed from that point through approximately 20 miles of mains, 90% of which are constructed of steel. The wastewater system consists of approximately 13.5 miles of sewer mains and one primary lift station and force main; five small lift stations and force mains are used to connect individual facilities into the main system. Wastewater is discharged into the City of Enids sanitary sewer system for treatment. The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information for a Replacement Communications for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) United States Mission Control Center (USMCC).  
Background:  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) manages the Nation's operational geostationary, and polar-orbiting environmental satellites, and manages a large collection of atmospheric, geophysical and oceanographic data.

Within NESDIS, the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution (OSDPD) manages and directs the operation of the central ground facilities which ingest, process, and distribute environmental satellite data and derived products to domestic and foreign users.  The Direct Services Division of the OSDPD manages and operates the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) program.  The SARSAT program and system are part of the international Cospas-Sarsat System which is an international system designed to provide distress alert and location data to assist search and rescue (SAR) operations, using spacecraft and ground facilities to detect and locate the signals of distress beacons operating on 406 Megahertz (MHz) or 121.5 MHz.   The position of the distress and other related information is forwarded by the responsible Cospas-Sarsat Mission Control Center (MCC) to the appropriate SAR authorities.

Currently, the Cospas-Sarsat system consists of an MCC in Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taipei, United Kingdom, and the United States.   MCCs are being planned in Greece, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam.  

Further information concerning Cospas-Sarsat can be found at http://www.cospas-sarsat.org/  and
http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/ .

The United States Mission Control Center (USMCC) is located in Suitland, MD.. The USMCC exchanges 1) non-alert system information directly with each of the other MCCs and 2) alert information through the Cospas-Sarsat nodal network.   X.25 via Packet Switched Data Networks (PSDNs) provided by WorldCom and SPRINT has been the primary means for the exchange of non-alert and alert information between the USMCC and other MCCs.  As a matter of fact, X.25 via PSDNs has evolved to be the principal means of data communications among all the MCCs within Cospas-Sarsat.   Direct links from the USMCC to the PSDNs of WorldCom and SPRINT as well as  the international X.75 gateways provided by WorldCom and SPRINT.   It should be noted that the data volume among MCCs is low and 56 kbps links are more than sufficient.           

Problem Statement

As a member of the Cospas-Sarsat program involved in satellite-aided search and rescue, the USMCC  uses an X.25 based network as its primary means for sending and receiving data internationally on emergency beacon activations.  The USMCC  currently communicates with  MCCs in 23 countries via X.25 . Countries and locations appear below: 
ALMCC  Algiers, Algeria; ITMCC Bari, Italy; ARMCC  Ezeiza, Argentina; JAMCC Tokyo, Japan;  ASMCC Cape Town, South Africa;  KOMCC Daejeon, R. of Korea, AUMCC Canberra, Australia;  NMCC Bodoe, Norway;  BRMCC Brasilia, Brazil;	PAMCC Lahore, Pakistan; CHMCC	Santiago, Chile; PEMCC Callao, Peru; CMC Moscow, Russia; SAMCC Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; CMCC Trenton, Canada; SIMCC Singapore, Singapore; CNMCC Beijing, P. R. of China; SPMCC	Maspalomas, Spain;
FMCC  Toulouse, France;  TAMCC	ITDC/Taipei MCC;  HKMCC  Hong Kong, China;	UKMCC  Kinloss, UK;  IDMCC  Jakarta, Indonesia.


Under the FTS 2001 contract both WorldCom and SPRINT have announced the termination of their respective PSDNs between December 2002 and June 2003.   It should be noted that AT&T terminated their PSDN in December 1999.  Although the USMCC utilizes the PSDN of WorldCom under a contract that expires in October 2005, the future commercial availability of PSDNs and associated X.75 gateways in the United States appears bleak   As noted in the Background,  X.25 via PSDNs has evolved to become the primary data communications means within Cospas-Sarsat.  It is not known at this time what the future holds for PSDNs in the other countries that have Cospas-Sarsat MCCs.  Because of the number of countries involved and the management structure of Cospas-Sarsat, it is estimated that it would take Cospas-Sarsat 6-8 years to completely transition to another primary means of data communications .  

The Needed Information:

The primary purpose of this RFI is the acquisition of information including estimated costs  that shows an alternative X.75 gateway, either in the United States or another country, that  can be accessed to allow the USMCC to continue X.25 data communications until at least 2010.   

The secondary purpose of this RFI is the acquisition of information concerning data communications methods other than X.25/PSDNs that could  be considered future candidates for the primary data communications method within Cospas-Sarsat.  Appendix A provides a set of high level requirements for an international communications network.

APPENDIX A: Communications System Requirements

Reliable
The communications service shall be provided 24 hours-per-day on a continuous basis.  The service must be relatively error-free and reliable and must have an error transmission rate of one in ten billion or less. 

The communications service shall have an operational availability of 99.5% or greater calculated for each calendar day.  All preventive maintenance shall be transparent to the Government.  Any interruption of service shall be treated as an outage.

The communications service shall provided a timely method of delivery failure notification to the USMCC. 

Maximize single transmission size limitations

The typical single message size transmitted between MCCs is 256 bytes.  However, the communications service shall allow for individual message size up to at least 25,000 characters and ensure that message content shall not be modified.

The communications service shall also handle text format using International Alphabet #5 (IA5) representation. 

Globally accessible

The communications service shall be globally accessible allowing NOAA to easily add communication sites (e .g., Vietnam, Greece, and Nigeria will be added in the next year.).  The service shall also allow NOAA to easily remove or modify communication sites.

Responsive maintenance

Due to the critical nature of the information to be disseminated, the contractor shall provide a single point of contact for trouble reporting and provide 24-hour trouble support with a response time not to exceed two (2) hours.  The USMCC shall be notified at least 48 hours in advance of any unavoidable, scheduled outage.

The communications service shall provide for automatic rerouting of messages within network to eliminate single points of failure within the cloud. 

The communications service shall provide circuit status confirmation and provide a timely method of receipt verification.


Security

The communications service shall provide the resources to ensure that inbound traffic is restricted to authorized call-ins designated by the USMCC and all inbound traffic is authenticated using parameters such as calling address, called address and call user data.

Cost Effective  

The communications service must minimize both recurring and non-recurring costs.

Other Considerations
?	The communications service must be accessible in terms of technology and price for all Cospas-Sarsat members
?	The communications service must provide for either centralized management by an entity other than the US or distributed management such that each member country works with the vendor to manage and maintain their part of the system

Contact Information: ALL Responses to this RFI will be accepted ONLY by e-mail no later than 3:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, February 3, 2002, to the following e-mail address:  Lou.Rubin@noaa.gov .

<DESC>This serves as a sources sought notice and market survey to locate qualified small businesses capable of manufacturing a Whirl-Pak Sampling Bag for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).  FSIS is seeking a 7.5 inch x 15 inch (width x length) bag with a filter mesh bonded into the sides and bottom seams and extending to the top of the bag, forming two compartments within the bag.  The bag must be sterilized with ethylene oxide gas.  Documentation of sterility must be available.  The bag is manufactured under a quality system certified to ISO 9001.  The bag must have a whirl-pak closure.  The wire closure must be plastic covered to prevent puncture of the bag during closure operation and handling.  The bag must be rugged to endure 2 minutes of pummeling in a laboratory stomacher with 650 ml moisture of meat and broth without leakage.

This bag is used in the analysis for E. coli 0157:H7, a very dangerous food poisoning pathogen.  The analysis for this organism presents considerable risk to the analyst and requires great care in selecting equipment and supplies for the purpose.  A sample is placed in one compartment and when enrichment broth is added, it permeates the mesh and in the second compartment, provides a debris-free source for pipetting operations, which occur later in the analysis.   

Small businesses having the capabilities necessary to provide the Whirl-Pak Sampling Bag are invited to submit a sample of the Whirl-Pak Sampling Bag.  This information will allow the Government to determine whether small business concerns can satisfy the Government?s requirement and whether the procurement should be set-aside for small businesses. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 314911, Textile Bag Mills, and the small business size in number of employees is 500.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation and no solicitation package exists at this time.  The Government is not requesting technical proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this sources sought notice.  Your responses will be used solely for market research purposes of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender.  If a solicitation is later released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this cite for the release of any synopsis or solicitation.

Interested small businesses are requested to submit their capability statement, experience and sample.  Responses should also include the following: name and address of firm; size of business; number of years in business.

Responses may be submitted by e-mail to janet.elm@usda.gov; or by mail to Janet Elm at USDA, FSIS, ASD, 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Maildrop 5230, Beltsville, MD 20705-5230; or by fax at 301-504-4276.  The information requested is due by 3:30 p.m. local time on January 30, 2003.
