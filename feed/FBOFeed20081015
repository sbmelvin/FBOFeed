<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Bigge Crane and Riggins for static load testing of the Folsom Dam Spill Gate A-Frame and Lifting Beam Frame.
The intent of this procurement is to certify the design load capacity of the A-Frame and the associated Lifting Beam Frame which have recently been modified:The design load capacity of the A-Frame is 150,000 lbs and requires load testing at 125% of the design load capacity for certification purposes.  Therefore, a total load of 187,500 lbs needs to be successfully incurred by the A-Frame, 6" diameter pin, two 2-1/4" diameter bolts, welds, etc.  The Lifting Beam Frame weighs 16,000 lbs and thus the total load that needs to be rigged to the lifting beam frame latches (see sketch and drawings 485-208-1223 and 1224) is 171,500 lbs.  Therefore, each latch shall be loaded at 50% of the total rigged load or 85,750 lbs each.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by email at tglasper@mp.usbr.gov. Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  This acquisition may be reserved for small businesses if there is adequate interest. Firms should identify business size (i.e. small business, other than small business, etc.) in accordance with the size standard for NAICS Code 238990 which is $13 Million. This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID’s Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement to provide and develop animal models in order to advance our understanding of infectious diseases as well as advance the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases.

 
NIAID’s role in developing medical products to counter emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases, as well as agents of bioterrorism, is part of a larger national strategy, involving multiple governmental agencies.  As such, NIAID supports integrated efforts in basic and applied research, product development, and technology development based on national priorities for medical products. Since 2001, NIAID has established a comprehensive infrastructure with extensive resources that support all levels of biodefense research.  With this solid framework of research and product development resources for biodefense in place, NIAID is now transitioning this infrastructure to provide the flexibility required to meet the challenges of emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases in addition to biodefense.

The use of animal models helps advance our understanding of infectious diseases as well as the development of therapeutics and vaccines.  For example, animal models are used to evaluate product candidates; provide data in support of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications; guide the selection of human dose levels and the design of clinical studies/trials; and provide pivotal efficacy data for products to be licensed under FDA’s “Animal Efficacy Rule” (21 CFR 314.610 and 601.91), when clinical trials are not ethical or feasible.  In addition, for emerging and rare diseases, understanding the disease in animals may provide relevant information when little can be learned directly from humans.  Therefore, DMID is committed to developing and providing animal models to benefit the research community and public health.

For the most part, animal model services are currently provided through multiple, specialized programs. DMID now seeks to adopt an integrated approach to the provision of services by creating unified, comprehensive, coordinated programs. This strategy is being employed to: advance science by promoting cross-fertilization across and within disciplines and approaches; serve the research community more conveniently; achieve efficient use of resources through economy of scale and avoidance of duplication; and provide the flexibility needed to respond to changing priorities. Accordingly, DMID is establishing the Animals Models of Infectious Diseases program, utilizing the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract mechanism.  

Under IDIQ contracts, base contract awards are made to multiple offerors that successfully propose a general approach to the technical requirements of the solicitation, providing a guaranteed minimum award. Task orders for specific tasks requiring specialized expertise are solicited and funded within the program Contractor pool. DMID is replacing multiple pathogen or class specific solicitations with one broad IDIQ solicitation for multiple contracts to cover all areas of current and potential future interests.  Animal models currently covered by existing pathogen-specific contracts will not be re-competed separately upon completion; however, they could be awarded as task orders under this program, upon expiration of those contracts.  

DMID is also establishing the Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Biological Research Resources (MID-BRR) program, which will serve as a central repository for microbiology and infectious disease researchers. The Animal Models of Infectious Diseases program will ensure a supply for the MID-BRR of pathogens that must be grown in animals and reagents integral to research on these organisms.

The Technical Requirements will be assembled into the following sections:

o	General Statement of Work, which specifies the basic technical requirements for all contracts.
o	Part Statements of Work, which specify additional technical requirements for contracts awarded to support each of four specific Parts:

Part A – Small Animal Models
Part B – GLP Small Animal Models
Part C – Non-Human Primate Models (+/- GLP)
Part D – Nontraditional Animal Models (+/- GLP)

Offerors may propose in response to one or more Part(s) of their choosing, and are not expected to respond to all Parts.  Offerors are also not expected to be responsible for all pathogens of interest or within scope for these contracts.  Offerors responding to multiple Parts must provide separate Technical and Business Proposals for each Part.  Proposals for each Part will be reviewed independently.  

For the purposes of this contract:
&#61607;	Small animals (Parts A and B) are defined as traditional small laboratory animal species, such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, chinchillas, and rabbits. 
&#61607;	Non-human primates (Part C) include various species, such as macaques, including Chinese and Indian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), cynomyologous macaques (Macaca fascicularis), and pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina), etc.  Excluded are baboons and chimpanzees.
&#61607;	Nontraditional animals (Part D) are defined as specialty laboratory animal species not covered in Small Animal or Non-Human Primate Models (Parts A – C), which may have requirements not met in typical biomedical laboratory animal facilities, such as armadillos, woodchucks, snails, other invertebrates, and goats, swine, horses, cattle, etc.
&#61607;	Products to be evaluated in these animal models are broadly defined to include vaccines and other prevention strategies (e.g. microbicides), therapeutics targeting the host or the pathogen, including immunotherapeutics, and diagnostics.   Products will be provided to the Contractor by the Project Officer or a third party after Project Officer approval. 
&#61607;	Pathogens of interest must be pathogens of human concern and not only of animal concern; however surrogate human pathogen/animal combinations may be used for diseases where human pathogens cannot be studied in animal models.    
&#61607;	Pathogens are defined as bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, toxins, and other agents such as prions, including NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/CatA.htm). 
&#61607;	Reagents are defined as biochemical, genomic, molecular, cellular, and immunologic materials integral to research on these pathogens.

The following factors will be considered when evaluating proposals:

Technical Capability: adequacy and appropriateness of the general technical approach to animal model studies, to include conduct of product efficacy studies, animal model development, and supportive measurements (immunological, pharmacological, clinical, pathological, etc.); technical approach to pathogen production and characterization, including overall understanding of the pathogen and its behavior in animal models.  In addition, capability to comply with Good Laboratory Practices (21 CFR Part 58) will be evaluated for Part B, Part C and Part D.

Personnel and Project Management: adequacy, appropriateness and relevance of expertise, experience, qualifications, and availability of the key professional and technical staff with a project of similar size, scope, and complexity; adequacy and appropriateness of proposed organization and staffing to ensure efficient planning, initiation, implementation, conduct, and completion of all activities, including plans for communication and sharing of research resources.  

Facilities, Equipment and other Resources: availability of adequate, accredited animal facilities, with biocontainment appropriate for the pathogens proposed; availability of equipment necessary for the proposed animal studies; and adequacy of institutional biosafety program.

It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a seven-year period of performance beginning on or about 
January 4, 2010.  

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about September 29, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00421-05-G-0001 with the Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC), Bethpage, N.Y. 11714, for non-recurring engineering support for the E-2 In-flight Refueling (IFR) program to modify the E-2 to add the capability for the aircraft to be refueled from Joint Service and International coalition refueling tanker aircraft.  Under this program, both the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 and E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft will be modified either through retrofit or forward fit processes.  The acquisition encompasses two phases - Phase I is for Pre-Milestone B effort and Phase II is for effort which may be incurred once Milestone B approval has been granted.  This synopsis for the Phase I effort addresses the preliminary design analysis of the IFR required modifications for the E-2C and E-2D which will culminate in a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Navy Milestone B review.  Upon Milestone B approval, the Phase II will be initiated.  The Phase II effort  to complete the design, integration, and testing of the IFR modified E-2 aircraft will be covered by under a separate synopsis and a new contract.  The Phase I effort will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements) as NGSC is the designer, developer and sole manufacturer and systems integrator of the E-2 aircraft and weapon system and as such, is the only firm with the knowledge, experience and technical data necessary to provide the required supplies and services for the purposes of meeting the Navy’s needs.

Award will be based on the contracting officer's decision as to which offer provides the best value to the Navy, price, past performance, and other factors considered.
Assessing Proposals:  Best Value determined via Delivery and Price being slightly more important than Past Performance.
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history or for whom past performance information is not available, shall receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance may not represent the most advantageous quotation to the Government.
The Government reserves the right to acquire information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any source including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephone and/or written inquiry.  This information may include reviewing the Contractors Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), or past performance information from any source whatsoever.  Written inquiries/correspondence and telephone interviews will be posted in the contract file.
Although the PCO will seek to engage in an even-handed and fair evaluation process, the PCO is not obligated to engage in "equal" comparison of past performance of all offerors.  For example, if two more instances of past performance data are available for one contractor, the PCO is not then required to search for past performance of two additional contracts for every offeror.
The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose technically acceptable offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: price, past performance and delivery date. The Government intends to evaluate offers and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so. 

Price:  The PCO will evaluate price.  When the quotes are received, the PCO shall review the quotation and amendment(s) if issued
Evaluation of Price:  the offeror's proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-3.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to:
	(1)  Price competition/comparison	(2)  Completeness	(3)  Comparison with independent Government estimate
The Government will evaluate quotations for award purposes by adding the total price for all items for all contract years (base year plus option years.)  The government intends to award one contract for all items.  Quotations on partial contract line items or subline items will not be evaluated or otherwise considered for award.

Determination for Award to Best Value Offeror:
Upon completion of this review, award will be made to the contractor, whose quotation, conforming to the Request for Quotation, is considered most advantageous to the Government, considering Past Performance, Delivery and Price.
The Government reserves the right to select a contractor with other than the best past performance record if the pricing offered is so advantageous to the Government as to constitute a best value.  Conversely, the Government may select a contractor submitting other than the lowest priced quotation if the quality of past performance constitutes the greatest value to the Government and the pricing quoted can be determined fair and reasonable by competition or another approved means.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Technical Assistance will provide a pilot project for installation at the Arturo Merino Benítez (AMB) airport in Santiago or other airport, as determined by the DGAC.  The Technical Assistance will be divided into two concurrent tracks.  One track will analyze the viability of ADS-B technology for Chile’s national airspace.

The second track will include a similar analysis for LAAS technologies.  In addition to these activities, the Contractor shall evaluate any regulatory constraints that may hinder project implementation and identify long-term training needs and transfer of technology for DGAC personnel. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $980,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The Government does not intend to pay for the information requested, nor does this inquiry constitute an intent to do business.  Interested contractors should submit a response indicating their interest and answering the questions outlined below.  Response is requested by close of business 21 Oct 2008, to the attention of marilyn.g.jackson@eur.army.mil and kenneth.gunn@eur.army.mil.

<p>Capable sources are sought to perform software research and development for the RIE Division, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, Rome NY (AFRL Rome). AFRL Rome has a requirement to conduct software development and system support for the Web-Enabled Temporal Analysis System Tool Kit (WebTAS TK). WebTAS supports Air Force efforts in providing Department of Defense commands, services and various Federal Agencies with a software toolkit that provides a general data visualization and analysis infrastructure for the analysis of temporal, spatial, entity and association information. The flexible WebTAS architecture provides access to multiple data sources, data mining, and collaboration tools that facilitate trend, link, pattern, and distributed analysis to support activity prediction and customer unique capabilities like Strategic Worldwide Integration Capability (SWIC), Predictive Analysis and Network-centric Analysis for Collaborative Intelligence Assessment (PANACIA) and Master Air Attach Plan (MAAP) Toolkit. This effort will perform engineering and technical tasks and operations and maintenance support for current and new users of the WebTAS software toolset. Technical enhancements are needed to correct any identified shortcomings in the toolset and to provide additional capabilities, features, processes, and documentation. The enhancements will extend WebTAS functions and provide more effective and efficient capabilities to meet the needs of the users. Installation support will be needed to install the WebTAS software and hardware, and train users at multiple sites throughout the world. Operations and maintenance actions will be needed to provide continued system support to current customer sites and to the new sites after system installation. In the course of performance, the contractor will interface with various DoD and Government agencies through visits and electronic means, and technical visits that will take place at various sites, worldwide. The contractor will also provide technical support to the Air Force Research Lab/Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division to assist in the analysis, design, development, integration, testing, and evaluation. Anticipated deliverables include software, hardware, and technical documentation. An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months. The maximum contemplated ordering amount is anticipated to be approximately $300,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The prime contractor and their subcontractors for this contract must have Top Secret SCI security clearances; foreign allied participation at the prime contractor level shall not be permitted for this effort. In reference to the WebTAS TK effort, information can be obtained by contacting Government WebTAS TK Program Manager, Michael Welch, at (315) 330-7758, who will forward a copy of the WebTAS Read Library.

<DESC>A.	General Information

The Southwest Region will be standardizing Pads & Wipes.  This is a 5-year re-evaluation of this product group.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs’ needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes alcohol, povidone-iodine, witch hazel, benzalkonium chloride, adhesive remover, nail polish remover, baby wipes and any other products in this category.  The entire category of Pads & Wipes has an annual demand of over $60,000.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit’s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is December 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	Evaluation Criteria

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.
Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria
1.	Your company must manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of Pads & Wipes.  At a minimum, the line must include alcohol, povidone-iodine, witch hazel, benzalkonium chloride, adhesive remover, nail polish remover, baby and any other products in this category according to FDA, GMP, and USP requirements.

12.	Your company must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. Vendors that fail to offer a discount off the DAPA price will be disqualified.
13.	Please provide a list of product representatives for each account in the Southwest Region.
14.	Please provide your company’s returned goods policy.
15.	Please provide an implementation plan for servicing the supply requirements of the Southwest region.
16.	Please annotate the hours that customer service support is accessible via a toll-free number.    24 hours/day, 7 days/week support is preferable.  If your company does not provide preferable level of support, state the hours support is provided.
17.	Please provide any history of backorders, recalls, and/or adverse events for this product line stating dates and duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors should put their best foot forward, that is, provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations and any relief or resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these incidents.  If your company has not had any of the above, so state.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples with literature must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree and 5 = Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the “break”, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria
1.	The packaging is easy to open without compromising sterility.
a.	Clinicians require packaging that allows for easy opening without compromising sterility to prevent introducing bacteria to the skin surface.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.
c.	Evaluator will open/remove product from packaging without contaminating and apply to patient skin.  Evaluator will observe the ease of performing the task.


2.	The product does not leave lint behind.
a.	Clinicians require that the product not leave lint behind on the skin to prevent fibers from entering the body during procedures.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.
c.	After cleansing the patients’ skin, the evaluator will examine the skin and visualize if lint was left on the skin.

3.	The product effectively cleanses the skin.
a.	Clinicians require that the product effectively cleanse the skin to remove dirt, debris and bacteria.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.
c.	The evaluator will examine the patient’s skin with the naked eye and determine if there is any dirt and/or debris on the skin.  After the evaluator cleanses the skin, the evaluator will re-examine the skin with the naked eye and verify the skin is clear of dirt and debris.

4.	The product is non-irritating.
a.	Clinicians require that product not be irritating to the skin to prevent damage to the skin or allergic reactions.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.
c.	The evaluator will observe the condition of the patient skin before cleansing with the product and after the product has dried for compromise to skin integrity.

Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples with literature for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the evaluation results become more technically equal, price may become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

<DESC>Amendment 2

Background:The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is a safety-critical system that provides accurate precise navigation and landing guidance to equipped aircraft in any weather. The WAAS augments the United States Government (USG) Global Positioning System (GPS) and Standard Positioning Service (SPS). The primary mission of the WAAS is to provide a means for air navigation during all phases of flight in the National Airspace System (NAS); departure, en route and approach.  The WAAS augments GPS with the following three services: a ranging function, which improves availability and reliability; differential GPS corrections, which improve accuracy; and integrity monitoring, which improves safety.  
The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) is a ground-based augmentation to GPS that focuses its service on the airport area (approximately a 20-30 mile radius) for precision approach, departure procedures and terminal area operations. It broadcasts its correction message via a very high frequency (VHF) radio data link from a ground-based transmitter. LAAS will yield the extremely high accuracy, availability, and integrity necessary for Category I, II, and III precision approaches, and will provide the ability for flexible, curved approach paths. 
Scope of Work:In support of WAAS Phase III, significant technical refresh and reliability modifications will occur.  These modifications include development of an engineering model reference receiver that is L1C, L2C and L5 capable; improved WAAS processing for ionospheric estimation, scintillation robustness, and signal quality (evil waveform) monitoring; and incorporation of additional geostationary satellites and associated ground facilities.  
Integration of these enhancements must be seamless to WAAS users.  The system must continue to satisfy the stringent integrity requirements demanded of this safety of life navigation service. Integration of the new Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites into WAAS requires knowledge of signal generation simulation and modeling.  
To satisfy the above requirements, versatile systems engineering support as well as an in-depth understanding of the WAAS architecture and integrity design are required. The FAA requires senior systems engineering support for WAAS.  As well as, dedicated technical engineering support to GNSS modernization and LAAS.  The following tasks provide additional details on support activities sought by the FAA. It should be noted that inherent in these tasks are requirements for detailed knowledge of GPS receiver signal processing and design, an equivalent understanding of GNSS measurement processing and integrity algorithms,  and a mature GPS receiver and antenna test capability including access to an anechoic chamber.  Additionally, contractors shall have a demonstrated Radio Frequency (RF) interference survey, investigation capability and participation in forums on RF interference and GNSS modernization. 
An in-depth, thorough, comprehensive knowledge of WAAS and LAAS corrections generation, processing threads, integrity design, and an analytical support for WAAS modifications is required.
The ability to perform this work with a minimal to no learning curve is required. 
The FAA intends to award this contract as a Cost Plus-Fixed Fee type. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for these efforts are 541330, 541511, 541611, 541614, 561110, 541990 and 541712.

<DESC>This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SS) IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES as a part of Market Research and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The purpose of this SS is to see if there are qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB); Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB); Historically Underutilized Business (HUBZone); Small Business; Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB); and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)] capable of performing work described herein.  The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this SS notice or the NCI’s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.  
The Radiation Epidemiology Branch of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns.  Based on the responses received from this SS notice, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  THIS IS NOT AN RFP AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NCI, NIH TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  No RFP package is available at this time.  This project will provide support services for the conduct and management of epidemiologic investigations of cancer directed by the Radiation Epidemiology Branch alone or in collaboration with other investigators.  The principal activities can be classified as follows: 1) management and coordination of multiple, large-scale population-based single or multi-center studies in various both nationally and internationally and helps facilitate cooperation between NCI and its collaborators; 2) development of study materials, including questionnaires, interviews, abstract forms, coding forms, manuals of field procedures, and other documents; 3) identification of study subjects, including location of cancer patients and/or their relatives, selection of appropriate controls  and acquisition of appropriate study population rosters or files; 4) hiring and training of interviewers, abstractors, and other field personnel in multiple sites; 5) field supervision and management; 6) interviewing of study subjects; 7) abstracting and coding relevant medical and other records; 8) validation of cancers reported on interviews; 9) obtaining biologic specimens and arranging for shipping and sending to appropriate laboratories for testing; 10) data preparation and processing, including editing and preparing information in a format suitable for computer analysis and computing support, including to maintain software relation to radiation risks; 11) quality control and standardization, to ensure that appropriate and valid data are obtained; 12) tracing and mortality follow-up; and 13) translation and communication of study results to the affected study populations through websites and newsletters.
Although REB receives substantial support for our studies, Branch epidemiologists are in complete control of all scientific aspects of each project.  As described earlier, each project conducted under our support services contract requires protocol development and review by several DCEG and NCI committees. REB investigators are very attentive to the need for quality control measures and carefully supervise the field management of their studies. The branch is very attentive to the oversight of the support services contract. Currently there are two support services contracts, each of which is monitored by two-three REB project officers who are in frequent contact with the contractors and get together monthly at meetings with the contractor. Other investigators utilizing the contracts participate at these meetings for overall scientific project and budget review, resolution of outstanding problems, and setting of priorities. We are planning to require tenure track investigators to attend meetings with the support services contractor within one year of joining REB and to become assistant project officers on the contract within two years. Detailed monthly reports are written by the contractor, describing progress on a study-by-study basis and are critiqued by NCI investigators. In addition, individual projects have weekly meeting between the support services contractor and the REB investigators.).In addition to frequent telephone and e-mail contact, individual contract personnel meet weekly with Branch investigators, and multiple members of both staffs meet monthly for overall scientific project and budget review, resolution of outstanding problems, and setting of priorities.  Detailed monthly reports are written by the contractor, describing progress on a study-by-study basis, and are critiqued monthly by NCI investigators.  All individual steps undertaken in a study are documented by the contractor, including a log of decisions made which affect study design, conduct or analysis.  Verifications, discrepancies and error rates for data collection, preparation and entry are reported to Branch investigators.  Branch members accompany contract personnel to field operations and frequently participate in pre-testing of data collection forms, evaluation of quality of medical or other records, and the quality control re-abstraction or re-interviewing process.  Required annual site visits are conducted to evaluate further contract personnel, resources, and performance. We also have a budget specialist who attends meetings with the support services contractor, reviews monthly cost reports, has found several errors in the reports and been instrumental in revisions in the reports and the methods of preparing the reports. Project officers have actively consulted with the contracts office to help assess options, both in terms of use of subcontracts and in terms of how best to provide incentives to the support services contractor for optimal performance. We are strongly considering use of options recommended by the contracts office to provide efficiency incentives in the next contract proposal, such as rewards for noncompetitive extensions of the contract dependent on continuously improving performance. We also intend to raise efficiency issues in the contract process, such as billing time units, which could potentially reduce the cost of services to REB (and other branches).
It is anticipated that a level of effort of 81,848 hours over a five-year period will be required to perform this requirement.  Small businesses possessing experience and demonstrated capability to accomplish the aforementioned requirements and level of effort are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to successfully perform the required services.  Information furnished must not exceed 20 pages (12-point font minimum), including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.; and should include an outline of previous or similar projects performed.  All responses must include an indication of current certified small business status, and clearly marked on the first page of the capability statement.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  In the event an RFP is issued, NAICS code 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees is being considered.  
All capability statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via e-mail) to Kenya Crawford, Contract Specialist, at crawfordke@mail.nih.gov in either MS Word, WordPerfect or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by October 30, 2008, 3:00 PM, EST.  All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.

<DESC>General:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior, intends to negotiate a sole source, Commercial Services Contract with H&H Industrial Motors Inc, 5130 West 16th Street, Cicero IL, to acquire the below listed services.
The project location is at Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial in Put-in-Bay, Ohio. The monument is a 352-foot column in the Doric Order built of 78 courses of pink Milford, Massachusetts granite.   The monument's rotunda is of Indiana limestone, with a floor of Tennessee and Italian marble. It is surmounted by a 23-foot tall bronze urn. Plazas are of granite stones and a circular brick pattern at base of column with granite benches, urns, and planting boxes. The column itself is essentially unreinforced masonry constructed on bedrock. On 6/22/2006, a portion of a 500-pound granite fascia stone fell off the Observation Deck and crashed onto the Upper Plaza penetrating the concrete slab into the basement below. Both metal (urn) and column (granite) pieces have fallen off since this time.  A design-build contract was awarded to Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. to acquire services such as supplemental investigation, analysis, stabilization, and temporary waterproofing repairs at monument to make it safe for the public.  
Prior to any construction efforts as part of the noted contract, the elevator must be rebuilt as noted herein for safety and continuity of operations.  The work of this contract consists of non-personal services to rebuild the 1936 Otis Elevator Company, Model No. 70, gearless hoist machine in the Memorial Column.  The elevator was originally manufactured and installed by Otis Elevator Company in 1918.  Much of the elevator and its components remain in their original condition.  Over its nearly 90 year operating life, only a few major components have been replaced. The balance of the elevator remains original.  The hoist machine remains original. The motor's condition indicates that it is beginning to fail and the bearings, seals, brake shoes and brake coil all require refurbishment to extend the reliable operation of the hoist machine for at least another 50 years.  The hoist machine will be rebuilt on-site.
This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures of FAR 5.201 and 6.302.  The subsequent contract will be negotiated in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 as a commercial services contract.  The Government believes that the identified contractor is the "only one responsible source", as defined by FAR 6.302-1, for the required services.  Firms that believe they can provide the required services described below are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice to the Contracting Officer as noted below.
PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED include completely refurbishing the hoist machine to include but not be limited to: Suspend the elevator car and counterweight and remove the hoist ropes from the drive sheave; Remove all brush rigging and the upper casing from the hoist motor; Remove all four motor shunt field coils; Clean shunt field coil pole pieces and protect with rust-inhibiting pain; Strip armature to remove all material, clean core and prepare to receive new magnet wire coils; Install new bearings at both ends of armature shaft; Install new seals and gaskets at both armature end caps; Install new formed copper armature coils on armature in place; Turn and undercut the hoist motor commutator surface; Install new motor shunt field coils; Reassemble the hoist motor and install the upper casing; Install new commutator brush holders. Stagger brush holders so brush contact patter is dispersed across the maximum available area of the commutator while allowing adequate space for horizontal movement of the armature during emergency stops; Remove the existing brake coil and install a new the brake coil; Remove both brake arms and reline both brake pads; Remove, polish, lubricate and reinstall all brake pivot pins, including brake arm pivots and brake actuating levers; Replace the hoist ropes and suspend the elevator car from the ropes; Adjust the brake for running clearances specified by the manufacturer; Adjust the elevator to stop within 1/4" of sill at all openings.  The contractor shall also provide a schedule prior to start of services showing the anticipated period of performance to complete the work.  All work shall be done in accordance with standard commercial practices and published elevator safety standards.   
This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses from contractors who believe they are capable of performing the work must be received within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis and will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by FAX at (303) 987-6646, Attention:  Nicole Haines.  Responses should include a brief narrative of the contractor's capability to perform the services, the contractor's Dun and Bradstreet number and identification of the contractor's business size in accordance with the size standard.

<DESC>The US Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Ogden, Utah that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 11,616 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 10,014 ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for 5 years, 2 years firm.

One hundred three (103) surface parking spaces also are required.  

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to complete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider among other things the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred due to relocation, e.g., physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST:  Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building’s ownership.  If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:30 PM EDT, October 22, 2008.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Command, PicatinnyArsenal, NJ 07806-5000 is interested in receiving white papers from industry for the development and demonstration of high reliability innovative warhead technologies/fuze designs that increase the lethality/performance of expelled submunitions in US Army Cannon-Launched 155mm M864, M483 and 105mm M915 and M916 Dual-Purpose, Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) Artillery Projectiles. 

The US DoD Policy on Cluster Munitions (CM), such as DPICM, requires that deployed CMs do not result in more than 1% unexploded ordnance (UXO) across the range of intended operational environments. Self-deactivation devices or mechanisms can be used to reduce residual hazards to civilians; however self-deactivated submunitions will still be considered UXO.

Cannon-Launched Artillery DPICM Projectiles are primarily used to engage and neutralize large area targets, and being as such, any replacement will need to address the same target sets.  These targets can range from light personnel to medium-armor typically characterized by aluminum hulled vehicles.

Industry is requested to address the following areas in their white papers; Warhead/Fuze Design & Maturity, Self-Destruct/Self De-Activate technologies, High Submunition Reliability, Energy/Power Source(s), Lethality Analysis, and Average Unit Production Cost (AUPC) estimates. 

Proposed solutions from industry can vary from proposals to improve existing impact-iniating fuze arming reliability and improved submunition stabilization to achieve UXO requirement, reducing the number of submunitions expelled, to the development of a new submunition or some other completely new warhead design. 
All proposed warhead solutions must be capable of being loaded and fired in the ballistic environments associated with US Army 155mm and 105mm Howitzer Weapon Systems.

Additional information relating to the ballistic environment artillery projectile/submunitions are exposed to during employment can be requested by contacting the Point of Contact below.  Additional information related to advances made by the government under the Fuze and Power Army Technology Objective in Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) Safing and arming devices, MEMS Impact switches, proximity sensors, electronic S&A devices (ESADs) and munitions power source technology can be requested by contacting the point of contact below.  

The contractor shall identify and mark within their submission any information that is considered proprietary. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input because of this Request for Information. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. This request for information is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government. No award will be made because of this request for information. If a formal solicitation is issued at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. White Papers are requested no later than COB on 1 December 2008. The POC for this request for information is Peter Vincenti, Contract Specialist, 973-724-5368, peter.vincenti@us.army.mil.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:The Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center VISN 10 Contracting Activity,	10000 Brecksville Road, Brecksville, OH 44141 intends to procure on a sole source basis a consignment agreement from date of award till 9/30/2013 with Bard Peripheral to provide Surgical Implants (Stents) for the Radiology Department. Requirements are as follows. The contractor shall furnish the following supplies and quantities and deliver them to the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center Wade Park Division, Radiology Service:  Catalog # EX060403CD, LifeStent, 1 ea; Catalog# EX060603, Life Stent, 1 ea; Catalog #EX070303CD, LifeStent, 1 ea; Catalog# EX070403CD, LifeStent, 1 ea; Catalog# 080403CD, LifeStent, 1 ea; Catalog# 080603CD, LifeStent, 1 ea; Catalog# FTL06060, Fluency Plus Tracheobronchial Stent Graft, 1 ea; Catalog# FTL07040, Fluency Plus Tracheobronchial Stent Graft, 1 ea; Catalog# FTL07060, Fluency Plus Tracheobronchial Stent Graft, 1 ea; Catalog# FTL08040, Fluency Plus Tracheobronchial Stent Graft, 1 ea; Catalog# FTL09040, Fluency Plus Tracheobronchial Stent Graft, 1 ea; Catalog# FTL10040, Fluency Plus Tracheobronchial Stent Graft, 1 ea; Catalog# FTL10060, Fluency Plus Tracheobronchial Stent Graft, 1 ea. It has been determined that the above listed stent grafts are the only stent grafts capable of meeting this requirement for the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center in Cleveland, OH, due to the need to maintain interoperability with the systems that are currently in-use at the facility. The proposed contractor is the manufacturer and has a patent for the products being procured. The stents are third generation bare metal stents. The first and second generation stents were made of rings that were linked together and in order to gain flexibility one needed to sacrifice strength. The Lifestent is the first ever helical stent that spirals down like the DNA helix and allows the stent to be more flexible without giving up strength. The FDA's finding from the SFA study found the stents was the only commercially available bare metal stent approved to treat lesions in the SFA. The stent graft system is also patented by the contractor and is designed to be used with the stents listed. This device has a low delivery system profile and convenient deployment with an easy-to-use pull back delivery system. This delivery system has a "tipless" inner catheter that reduces the risk of catheter entanglement post deployment. The Small Business Standard is a sole source requisition. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act as implemented by FAR 13.501, for brand name commercial items, using this is an intent to award sole source. The applicable NAICS Code is 339112 with a size standard of 550 employees. This notice for informational purposes only; NO FORMAL SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED as a result of this announcement. Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information in response to this notice via E-Mail to the address listed below or thru the US Postal Service. Only written requests will be accepted. Responses not received before October 20, 2008 1:00pm EST, a sole source consignment contract with Bard Peripheral Vascular  will be pursued.

<CONTACT>Michael Duffy, Contract Specialist, (973)724-6627

<a href="mailto:michael.duffy7@us.army.mil">Michael Duffy</a>
<DESC>The United States Armament Research & Development Engineering Center (ARDEC)is in the process of assessing the industrial base state of the art in Common Guidance and Control Modules (CGCM) on munitions ranging from 105mm to 155mm artillery shells and 81mm to 120mm mortar rounds, and how these technologies can provide better precision on the aforementioned range of munitions for our soldiers at an affordable cost. 

ARDEC will hold an Industry Day on 6 Nov 2008 at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, to seek out industry partners to bring CGCM industry solutions and/ or Government designs to a successful guided flight demonstration by September 2009 (Objective) or June 2010 (Threshold).  To accomplish this, ARDEC is interested in forming multiple Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) with industrial base sources to conduct a gun-fired, guide-to-target demonstration in the stated time frame to assess these technologies.

Interested parties should submit their request to attend the Industry Day to the point of contact identified below no later than 24 Oct 08 via email. The request shall include attendees nationality information. Respondents will receive an invitation from ARDEC via email no later than 29 Oct 08, announcing the specific time and place for the 6 Nov 08 Industry Day. A non-disclosure-agreement (NDA) form will be attached in the invitation for the respondent to fill out. The participant must execute the NDA prior to attending the Industry Day.
ARDEC will provide a more detailed explanation of the proposed guided flight demonstration as well as a detailed description of the Government CGCM designs during the Industry Day. Details on the CRADA arrangements will be presented in the morning of the Industry Day. One-on-one breakout conference rooms will be made available, as required, during the afternoon for additional discussions. It should be noted that attendance by foreign representatives is contingent upon their submitting and getting approval of an embassy-sponsored visit request, and any decision to enter into a subsequent CRADA is contingent on compliance with US export control laws, policy and regulations.	ARDEC intends to enter appropriate CRADA partnerships that are best suited to accomplishing the stated project objectives. If needed for the demonstration of the technology, ARDEC can furnish projectile & cartridge technical information, weapon system information, Government CGCM design solutions and maturity levels, a test site, weapon for testing, test instrumentation and data gathering support, but industry must provide munition test assets for their 120mm mortar and/or 105mm artillery demonstration. US weapons (120mm smooth bore mortar and 105mm artillery) will be used for the guide-to-target demonstration.. Modeling and simulation may be used to show the commonality potential of the CGCM guidance approach across the aforementioned range of munitions (81mm mortar, 120mm Mortar, 105mm artillery, and 155mm artillery).  
CGCM objective capabilities include guidance, navigation, and control technology; fuzing safe and arming devices; power supplies; fuze functionality (impact, delay, proximity, time, etc.). The objectives for the CGCM are a delivery accuracy of less than 5-meter Circular Error Probability (CEP) objective and 10-meter CEP threshold. It should be noted that the government has been pursuing and maturing several design solutions that may meet the CGCM objectives. 
ARDEC respects the importance of corporate intellectual property and data security while balancing the need to document the benefits of public expenditures. Provisions relating to proprietary information and intellectual property shall be set forth in the CRADA. 
Two types are CRADAs are being sought; CRADAs for the guide-to-target demonstration of the industry base precision guidance concepts; CRADAs to mature and demonstrate government CGCM designs. ARDEC is seeking industry expertise on design, fabrication, integration, and assembly of CGCM solutions which may or may not utilize the Government design solutions.
Descriptions of the proposed CRADA efforts from the interested parties should be submitted electronically by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 3 December 2008. 
Submissions should be limited to 10 pages and desired content will be disclosed at the Industry Day. CRADA submissions should also include: the names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and email addresses of the primary contact person. Single page resumes of key project participants and a company profile may be included but are not counted in the 10 page maximum length. The CRADA submission and inquiries should be directed to the Point of Contact listed below.
NOTE:  An invitation to or participation in the Industry Day will not constitute any commitment on behalf of ARDEC to pursue future work.  ADREC may or may not pursue future work as a result of this Industry Day. Point of Contact is Jeff Cheung, email: jeff.cheung@us.army.mil, phone 973-724-6780, US Army ARDEC, ATTN: AMSRD-AAR-MEF-S, Building 94, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  07806-5000

<a href="mailto:lillian.t.fox@usace.army.mil">US Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville</a>
<DESC>Integrated Modular Medical Support Systems (IMMSS)<BR>Industry Day Announcement<BR>Solicitation Number:  W912DY-08-R-0038<BR><BR>This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Both small and large businesses are encouraged to participate.<BR>The US Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville, Alabama (CEHNC) has a $230 million requirement over the next five years for the provision of modular medical systems furniture, identified as Integrated Modular Medical Support Systems (IMMSS), and associated services to Government medical facilities throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. territories and possessions, and various overseas locations. IMMSS is comprised of modular furniture product lines with components that are reconfigurable and interchangeable within each product line.  IMMSS was initially developed and provided to the Government by Herman Miller for Healthcare under an expired negotiated Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with MEDCOM Contracting in 1996 and further provided to the Government under a follow-on sole source ID/IQ contract in 2005. Herman Miller is currently the sole IMMSS contractor.  Other manufacturers also provide systems to MEDCOM facilities outside the IMMSS program.  The Government is currently performing market research to determine if there are other vendors who are capable of performing the IMMSS requirements. The basic requirement is to provide integrated modular furniture systems for the healthcare environment that are easily interchangeable and reconfigurable with a high percentage of reuse.  Systems shall include both healthcare environment specific applications and features as well as office applications features.  Healthcare and office systems components within a product line shall be physically and architecturally compatible and interchangeable.  Systems and components for healthcare environments should be able to be cleaned using a cart washer, wand-washed or steam cleaned.  Systems shall generally be in compliance with MIL-STD-1691, which can be found at http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/browse_org.php?o=24.  Required systems include applications for examination rooms, treatment rooms, nurse and reception stations, pharmacies, laboratories, dental clinics, offices, administrative and logistics functions, waiting areas, veterinary clinics, research, classroom/training, and other related functions in medical facilities.  Physical integration and/or compatibility with existing Herman Miller IMMSS systems, or systems made by other manufacturers, can be required.  It is anticipated that approximately 50% of the work will require architectural and/or physical integration with existing Herman Miller IMMSS systems.  The remaining 50% of the work will not require integration with existing Herman Miller IMMSS systems.  A small portion of the remaining work may require integration with systems made by other manufacturers, but most is expected to be initial outfitting of facilities or areas that will not require integration with existing systems.  Associated services will include design, delivery/transportation, installation, minor facility renovation or repair work performed during installation, maintenance, reconfiguration services, restorative services, panel fabric replacement services, clinical analysis services, extended project management services, inventory services, warehousing services, product orientation training, etc. The contractor will be required to have knowledge and experience with patient centered design principles, evidenced based design, and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).  The NAICS code for this requirement is 337214, Office Furniture (except Wood) Manufacturing.  <BR><BR>The Government will be hosting the Integrated Modular Medical Support Systems (IMMSS) Industry Day Conference on Thursday, October 30, 2008 at the Holiday Inn Research Park, 5903 University Drive, Huntsville, Alabama 35806.  The conference will begin at 08:00 for registration with the actual presentations starting at 09:00.  The conference will end at approximately 16:00.

We have found a unique opportunity for you to meet with buyers from Federal, State and Local Government Agencies, as well as large corporations. Making your business successful means branching out in search of Government Contract opportunities and Subcontracts from large corporations.

Did you know that 99% of all employment in the U.S. today and nearly 50% of the Gross National Product are generated by Small Businesses? Those statistics are why MacDill AFB and its networking partners are bringing Local, Federal, and State Governmental Agencies and major corporations together to network, educate, counsel and ultimately, contract, with SDVOSB firms.

Exciting Topics: The 2008 SDVOSB Technology Conference opens November 13 and includes a day of informative and educational sessions. This year's seminar topics include Veteran-Owned Small Business Opportunities in Federal Contracting; SDV Lessons Learned from Current SDV Contractors; and Financial Programs and Support. From certifying your Small Business to making your product more marketable, we will help you arm your business with critical information ensuring greater success.

Taking it to a Higher Level: On November 14, we will offer opportunities to develop and build strategic supplier relationships. Representatives from all layers of governmental agencies will be on hand to speak with attendees. Large corporations looking for qualified SDVOSBs will also be available to speak about partnerships and business opportunities. The full schedule, registration form, and other conference information may be found on the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA) website: http://www.afceatampa.org/sdvosb or call (813) 828-0264.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs VA Connecticut Health Care System (VACHCS) intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Carestream Health Inc.. under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-26. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition. Items being procured must be the same as or equal to:An EMC CX Raid Expansion 7.5 TB ATA - #1055797 - 1 each;  HI project management services #183654 - 30 each;  Install config system admin trng - 109061 - 104 each.RATIONALE FOR SOLE-SOURCE PURCHASE:  This RAID is required to upgrade our storage capacity in the current Carestream PACs system.    Carestream is the sole source provider for this RAID as the RAID resides directly on our archive manager within the Carestream PACs system.   Without this RAID we will shortly reach capacity for storage which will have an immediate impact on pt care services.No comparable system is currently available as a package assembling comparable capabilities from individual components would be costly to validate.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  All proposals received by 4:00 P.M. eastern Time, Oct 21st, 2008, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by e-mail (William.Prenzler@va.gov) or Mail VA Connecticut Healthcare System, 950 Campbell Ave. West Haven, CT 06516,  Mail Code 90C--------------------------------------------------------------

Delivery is FOB Destination and required 180 days after receipt of order. The solicitation will be issued on October 31, 2008 and close on Novenber 18, 2008.

<DESC>THIS MARKET SURVEY IS AMENDED TO ADD THE BUSINESS DECLARATION FORM.
In accordance with A.M.S.3.2.1.3.12 of the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS), industry is hereby informed that the FAA has a potential maximum five-year (a base period and four one-year option periods) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract requirement to prepare Documented Categorical Exclusions, Environmental Assessments, or Environmental Impact Statements in support of System Operations airspace and procedure actions.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from vendors capable of providing services for the preparation of environmental documents related to FAA's System Operations airspace and procedural design actions.
Although this program is not a set aside program for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Socially Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB) 8(a) or other small business, this Screening Information Request (SIR) is being released to ensure that SDVOSB, SEDB8(a) and other small businesses have an opportunity to provide the requested capabilities to satisfy the requirements of the Statement of Work. 
This notice is for informational and planning purposes only.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  This is not a solicitation.  This notice is not a SIR or a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind.  This notice does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not reimburse any costs for providing information, documentation, and/or data submitted or preparation costs for submittals in response to this notice.  Therefore, any costs associated with the market survey are solely at the interested vendor expense.  Since this is for information and planning purposes, no evaluation letters or results will be issued to respondents. 
Interested sources must respond with sufficient information to confirm evidence of their qualifications and capabilities to meet requirements in the attached DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW).  The FAA intends to review all response submittals to establish the qualified vendors list for submission of SIR.  Firms not responding to this announcement will be excluded from further consideration.  Any interested sources may respond to this market survey.  The information identified from this market survey may result in a restricted Screening Process when the SIR is issued.  All decisions will be made based on the information provided by vendors responding to this market survey. 
The point of contact for this market survey is Katherine M. Williams.  Please respond via email at katherine.m.williams@faa.gov.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

This notice is to alert industry that the current Solicitation Number (N00024-08-R-6324) for the JCREW 3.3 System of Systems will no longer be utilized due to the change in fiscal years.  From this point forward, Solicitation Number N00024-09-R-6303 will be utilized for the JCREW 3.3 System of Systems.  
This notice also serves to alert industry that there will be a requirement for Offerors to provide a listing and pricing of Long Lead Material for each of the mounted, dismounted, and fixed systems within the System of Systems for future Low Rate Initial Production.
The RFP will be published in FEDBIZOPPS on the internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Interested offerors should watch FEDBIZOPPS for release of the RFP.
The Navy anticipates RFP release in the first quarter of Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2009, with award anticipated in third quarter GFY 2009.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for the posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  This announcement revises and replaces the synopsis posted on 13 February 2008 for LCS Flight 0+.  The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue a fixed-price incentive fee Request for Proposals to General Dynamics Bath Iron Works (GD-BIW), 700 Washington Street, Bath, ME 04530, and Lockheed Martin Corporation Maritime Systems & Sensors (LM MS2), 199 Borton Landing Road, Moorestown, NJ 08057, for the construction of Littoral Combat Ship Flight 0+ Class Ships and associated supplies and se! rvices.  The scope will also include Special Studies, Analyses and Reviews; Provisioned Items Orders; Self Defense Test Ship Combat System Procurement and Installation, and Post-Delivery Support.  The requirement contemplated is for FY09 and FY10 ships, including potential FMS requirements.  The contract(s) will be awarded through a limited competition pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3), Industrial Mobilization; Engineering, Development, or Research Capability; or Expert Services.  The use of other than full and open competition is necessary in order to maintain facilities, producers and manufacturers available for furnishing supplies to achieve industrial mobilization.  Additionally, GD-BIW and LM MS2 are the only sources with the requisite knowledge of LCS Flight 0+ design, construction, systems, and extensive knowledge of, and experience with, mission module interface requirements to efficiently and effectively construct these additional follow-on ships within the required!  construction period, and perform the associated services.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact GD-BIW and LM MS2 directly.  See Numbered Note 22*****

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This announcement is for a set-aside for Small Business Participation.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Walla Walla District plans to award a single Nationwide Indefinite quantity contract (IDC) for a five-year period consisting of a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  The maximum amount the Government may order under this IDC shall not exceed $10 million.  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work as further described in this announcement.  The services will consist of Cost Engineering to support Walla Walla District designation as a Cost Engineering Directory/Center of Expertise.  The requirements under the IDC will be issued through firm-fixed price task orders utilizing the labor and overhead rates accepted with award of the IDC.  The estimated base and option year contract capacity is $2M each period.  Contract options may be exercised early if the contract capacity is utilized before the contract performance period expires.  However, the contract rates do not increase until the annual period for which they were negotiated has elapsed.  If capacity remains available at the expiration of any contract performance period and the Government determines it to be in its best interest to exercise the next contract option period, the unused capacity will be rolled forward for use in the subsequent contract performance period.  The annual rates for the then-current contract period will become effective for both the unused capacity of the previous period and the current annual capacity.  The annual contract rates are fixed prices for the annual period for which they are negotiated and shall not be adjusted as a result of the early exercise of contract options or when unused capacity is rolled forward to subsequent option years.  The contract minimum guarantee of $10,000 may be obligated via issuance of an initial task order concurrent with award of the IDC.  The IDC is anticipated to be awarded in February of 2009.

<DESC>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA - SFO 07-014 -OFFICE SPACE NEEDED - U.S. GOVERNMENT will seek to satisfy NEW AND / OR SUCCEEDING LEASE REQUIREMENTS through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) during the month of AUGUST - OFFER SUBMISSION PERIOD OPEN AUGUST 1, 2008 THROUGH AUGUST 7, 2008.  You MUST have an active offer under the 07 Series SFOs (07-014 (DC), 07-015 (MD), and 07-016 (VA)) in order to be considered for lease award.  REQUIREMENTS: The AAAP is a new web application enabling the electronic offering of building space for lease to the Federal Government.  This web application is located at the following internet address:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  In order to access this application, participants must first go to the AAAP website (at:  http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov) and select the “Register to offer space” link.  Please complete the online registration and the Government will notify you by email once a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) is posted to this website.  When you receive this email notification, you can submit your online offer using the AAAP.  Offerors can typically submit offers beginning with the 1st day of the open period every month through the last day of the open period every month.  Typically, the open period will start on the 1st of the month and end on the 7th of the month, except months in which new SFOs are posted, in which case the last day of the open period will typically be the 14th of the month.  The official opening time and closing time for each offer period will be established on the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) website at aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.  The U. S. Government is seeking to lease, in increments of up to 100,000 BOMA Rentable Square Feet of office and related space yielding up to 90,000 ANSI/BOMA Office Area Square Feet, office space to satisfy new requirements and compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government will relocate from existing space under lease if economics involved and other factors prove to be favorable.  The cost of moving, telecommunications, alterations, impact on agency mission and other variables to be determined by the Government, will be considered in the relocation decision in order to determine the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards and/or combine multiple space requirements.  OCCUPANCY:  Space must be ready for commencement of tenant alterations in the spring of 2008.  DELINEATED AREA:  All properties offered to the Government pursuant to SFO 07-014 must be located in Washington, DC; all properties offered to the Government pursuant to SFO 07-015 must be located in Suburban Maryland; all properties offered to the Government pursuant to SFO 07-016 must be located in Northern Virginia.
