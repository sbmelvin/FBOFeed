<CONTACT>Joyce Grudzinski Contract Specialist 7037871365     Joyce.Grudzinski@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The United States Marine Corps Network Operations and Security Command (MCNOSC) has an immediate requirement to provision fiber facilities located at US Marine Corps, 0 Pickle Meadows, Bridgeport CA. This requirement is being issued by GovWorks under the franchise authority of the Department of the Interior (DOI) in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. This competitive process will be simplified in order to facilitate the order process and prevent undue administrative burden upon the Contractor(s) and the Government. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only Request for Quotes (RFQ); a written RFQ will not be issued. This RFQ document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The following provisions and clauses apply to this RFQ: (1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (OCT 2000); (2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; (3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (APR 1998), with an addendum; and (4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items (AUG 2000).  DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:  Special construction to provision fiber facilities located at U. S. Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center, 0 Pickel Meadows, Bridgeport, CA  93517.  The USMC base will provide adequate entrance facilities and proper floor space for the necessary electronics.   PROPOSAL SUBMISSION- TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSAL CONTENTS:  The technical proposal shall define in detail the offeror's capabilities and approach to meeting the requirement. The cost proposal shall be a separate volume from the technical proposal and include: (1) Identification of the each labor category to be utilized for this effort; (2) The firm-fixed price hourly rate(s) proposed for each labor category; (3) Any other proposed associated costs; and (4) The total Firm Fixed Price.  EVALUATION CRITERIA AND AWARD: Each Offeror's proposal will be evaluated according to the factors shown below.  Factors A and B are roughly equal to each other; factor C is less important than factors A and B.  Sub-factors listed under each factor are of equal importance to each other.  Factor A - Technical Approach: (1) Understanding of the work required; (2) Discussion of specific methods and techniques for meeting the requirement; (3)  Anticipation of potential problem areas, creativity, and feasibility of solutions to problems; (4) Discussion of logistics, schedule, and any other issues of which the Government should be aware.  Factor B - Past Performance: (1) The contractor's history of successful completion of projects; (2) History of staying on schedule and within budget; and, (3) The contractor's specific experience in the requirements as defined in the Statement of Work.  Factor C - Cost will be evaluated for price reasonableness.  CONTRACT AWARD - Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors, and cost considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between proposals that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror.  In order to compete under this RFQ, interested parties must submit their proposals no later than 4:00pm Eastern Standard Time, September 12, 2003 to Joyce Mason Grudzinski, Contracting Officer, via e-mail: Joyce.Grudzinski@mms.gov. Please reference the RFQ number in the subject line of your email. Originals of both technical and cost proposals are to be submitted within five days of the closing date via mail to Joyce Mason Grudzinski, Department of the Interior, 381 Elden Street, MS2500, Herndon, VA 20170.

This solicitation No. 401813Q346, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001.13.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service intends to issue an award for the services of a contractor to provide all labor, equipment, herbicides, surfactants, indicator dyes, safety materials, and refuge disposal required for the application objectives within the scheduled time limitations of this agreement for the treatment of exotic, invasive plant populations.  The goal of the identified biotic intervention is to eliminate cogongrass (Imperata cyclindrica) and safely manage these levels while minimizing impacts to native and/or cultivated vegetation of the target sites.  Another goal is to maintain ecological integrity of surroundings indigenous communities.  The Refuge requires the services of a licensed chemical applicator certified with the Millissippi Bureau of Plant Industry in Forest and Right-of-Way weed control to conduct applications of Refuge target areas.   The performance of the Contractor's obligations under this agreement will be conducted at the location descriptions delineated on the maps, as well as additional areas to be determined on the Grand Bay NWR.  All target areas are within the Refuge Complex in Jackson County and will be designated with survey flagging per map.  Contact Helen Mitchell at 404-679-7231 for maps).  Total applied acreage will not exceed 105 acres.  The application method will utilize pressurized, tractor-mounted sprayer equipment in excellent repair and service condition.  The tractor should be capable of operation within power line right-ofway conditions.  A boom operator should provide variable directional spray placement and incorporate new fan type nozzles to distribute herbicide.  A pressurized hose reel with manually controlled nozzle will be required to accomplish spot spray applications to target areas inaccessible to tractor to travel within 100 feet of operable areas.  Spray tank mixture tanks will be completely cleaned prior to application and maintain no chemical residue.  The chemical mixture of Glyphosate and Imazapyr (Tradename:  Arsenal), will be used as a single, foliar application at 4 quarts per acre distributed not to exceed a 3% glyphosate solution mixture and at 1.5 quarts per acre distributed not to exceed a 2% Imazapyr solution mixture.   Glyphosate formulation used should be a labeled postemergent, broadspectrum, non-selective herbicide for control of annual and perennial weeds.  Solution mixture should contain labeled spreader/adjuvant as necessary and compatible with herbicide formulation.  An indicator dye will be added to the tank solution to assure visual overelap of application and proper coverage of target areas.  The contractor will conduct the application between October 1 and October 20, 2003 and repeat treatments, if necessary, in the early spring 2004.  A minimum of 100% of each designated treatment area must be adequately covered with chemical spray mixture.  Weather and site conditions will be assured to accomplish effective treatment results on all target areas.  All safe application procedures will be observed by the Contractor as per Mississippi Law.  All MSDS for materials utilized in this agreement shall be on the Refuge at time of applications.  All empty chemical containers and refuse are the responsibility of the Contractor and must be removed from the Refuge appropriately.  Trash and other debris resulting from the Contractor's operations must be controlled and removed from the Refuge.  Compliance inspections will be made during applications and at 3 and 6 week application intervals.  Contractor will coordinate contracted activities with refuge management activites including prescribed burning, predator control, and crane reintroduction acclimation.  Refuge will conduct biomass preparations (mowing or burning) in late summer and early spring on target areas (in crop units) to allow an 8-10 inch new vegetation re-growth at the date of chemical application.  Refuge will have an approved Service Pesticide Use Proposal prior to work.  Technical questions can be directed at Scott Hereford, Wildlife Biologist at (228)497-6322, ext. 28.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the following upgrades to existing equipment: (1) processor upgrade to an Aero-90 Load Control System and	an Aero-90 Laboratory Test Controller (LTC); (2) test station upgrade of Digital Structural Servo-Control (DSSC) signal condition unit; and, (3) maintenance, enhancement and support agreement for the Aero-90 and Aero-90LTC Load Control Systems.   NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from MTS Systems Corporation, 14000 Technology Drive, Eden Prairie, MN, 55344, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. All of the associated hardware and software is proprietary and supplied only by MTS Systems Corp. Reliable operation of the load control systems and compatibility of existing hardward is critical to the support of static structural testing at MSFC. Procurement of comparable replacement load control systems from other sources would entail a complete redevelopment and/or redesign of the existing load control systems and would cause major delays in current schedules for ongoing static structual tests. MTS Systems Corp. is the only supplier that can provide the upgrades, maintenance and support of the existing load control systems. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 23, 2003. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<SUBJECT>A -- Intent to issue BAA for the Integrated System is Structure (ISIS) Program.

<DESC>FedBizOpps announcement of intent to issue BAA for the Integrated System is Structure (ISIS) Program.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) intends to issues a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the development of a radar sensor that is highly integrated with a high altitude airship platform.  The system will operate unattended at an altitude of 70,000 feet, track airborne targets to the radar horizon and ground based targets (including dismount troops) halfway to the horizon.  The major challenges to be addressed are reducing the sensor, power system, and airship structural mass.  These challenges will not be met by developing an airship with a conventional sensor payload bay.  Meeting the sensor performance goals within mass limitations requires that the airship and sensor be an integrated unit.  It is anticipated that an extremely low power density active electronically scanned array, possibly conformal, will be employed to achieve requisite power-aperture requirements with projected apertures approaching the physical cross-section of the airship.  The BAA will be for a one year conceptual design study with options for proof-of-principal demonstrations of critical technologies.  Due to the multi-disciplinarily nature of this program, teaming is strongly encouraged.  

When the BAA is issued, further details will be announced in FedBizOpps.  For further information, contact baa03-36@darpa.mil via email or call Dr. Larry Corey at 703-248-1513.

<DESC>FAA conducted a market survey in 2001 and released FAA Specification FAA-E-2772A in October 2002 for Runway Visual Range (RVR) equipment.  A competitive procurement for RVR is scheduled for release during CY 2003.  Meanwhile, however, the FAA has requirements for components for integration and installation with other Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) in order to meet RVR delivery requirements until such time when the FAA completes the competitive procurement. The GFE consists of data processing units and software, sensor interface electronic units, site spares kits, manuals, and other components that remain in FAA inventory because of varied airport site-specific requirements.  To fulfill current requirements, FAA plans to negotiate a contract with Teledyne Controls, Los Angeles, CA, for data processing units, sensors and sensor assemblies, sensor interface cards, vs filter cables, calibration plates, and controller displays.  Teledyne will also assist the FAA with integration testing and airport installations. The period of performance for the contract is three years.  Teledyne Controls, Inc. is the designer and manufacturer of the RVR FA-10268.  They own the proprietary data and are the only source of a certified visibility sensor necessary for providing RVR data in the National Airspace System.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to award a sole source purchase order to Duke University Medical Center, Department of Pathology,  pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  These studies are collaborative efforts between NIEHS and Duke University.  This procurement is to provide detailed microscopic examination of the aortic valve in the heart in order for the National Toxicology Program to examine murine models of atherosclerosis following environmental exposure.  The procedure for identifying the atherosclerosis lesion is extremely complex and precision orientated.  It involves transversely cutting away the ventricles, mounting the part of the heart of interest so that tissue sections can be prepared towards the aortic valve.  Once one can view the aortic valve, then serial sections are cut through the area of interest and the atherosclerosis is evaluated.  The area of interest is extremely small, and if the researcher is not superbly skilled in the procedure he/she can section through the heart and miss the area of critical interest.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 10 days of date of notice to Elaine Shoaf at the above address or email shoaf1@niehs.nih.gov for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with the Duke University Medical Center, Department of Pathology.  The NAICS Code/Size is 541690/$6.0M.  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Elaine Shoaf via email shoaf1@niehs.nih.gov.*****

OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications ñ Commercial Items. The government reserves the right to make either a single or split award for the above noted structures.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and non-price-related factors. (non-price-related factors are technical capability, past performance, delivery etc.) 52.212-2  EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS--OCT 1995 (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming  to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.   (I)    TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE  REQUIREMENT (ii)   PAST PERFORMANCE (iii)  PRICE Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below. Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) t o be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is approximately equal  to Factor (iii), PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.    (b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' techni cal information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.  (c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.  Relevant Past Performance in this instance is defined as prior experience with the Department of Defense and more specifically but not limited to the U.S. Navy, where similar structures have been provided. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No ri sk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the opti on(s). (e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. QUOTES MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN 3:00 PM, LOCAL TIME  12 SEP 2003. Offers will be accepted  via fax (619-532-1088) or via e-mail (glenn.e.brown@navy.mil ).

OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications ñ Commercial Items. The government reserves the right to make either a single or  split award for the above noted structures.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and non-price-related factors. (non-price-related factors are technical capability, past performance, delivery etc.) 52.212-2  EVALUATION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS--OCT 1995 (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.   (I)    TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE  REQUIREMENT (ii)   PAST PERFORMANCE (iii)  PRICE Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered w ill be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below. Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is approximately equal  to Factor (iii), PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.    (b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT , Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.  (c)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfact ory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.  Relevant Past Performance in this instance is defined as prior experience  with the Department of Defense and more specifically but not limited to the U.S. Navy, where similar structures have been provided. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with de livery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a wri tten notice of withdrawal is received before award. QUOTES MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN 3:00 PM, LOCAL TIME  12 SEP 2003. Offers will be accepted  via fax (619-532-1088) or via e-mail (glenn.e.brown@navy.mil ).

Initial proposals (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by a panel of government experts using the following criteria: (1) understanding the problem, including the ability to plan and implement the program and formulate pertinent objectives; (2) soundness of technical approach, including ability to integrate the proposed technology, adequacy of analysis and degree of technology advancement; (3) allocation of resources, experience and management, including facilities, personnel and (4) past performance in similar efforts, specific areas to be evaluated are quality of product or services, timeliness of performance, and cost control; and (5) the proposed cost and cost realism.  No further criteria will be used in the evaluation.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds.  Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated.   Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Since many aspects of the IHPTET/VAATE initiative are classified, the offerors and their personnel may need to possess security clearances up to and including the secret level for contracts associated with IHPTET/VAATE, contemplated under this announcement.  Specific reporting (DD1423) requirements shall be specified within each contract award.   At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report.  Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals (IPs) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate.  BRIEFNESS IS DESIRABLE - IPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM.  Cost estimates in IPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged.  Offerors of those IPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal.  An invitation does not assure an offeror of a subsequent contract award.  One original and three copies of each IP, and later, if invited, of each formal cost and technical proposal are to be submitted.  IPs and Proposals shall be submitted to the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, AIR 4.4T, Bldg 106, Unit ID 4, 22195 Elmer Road, Patuxent River, Maryland 20670-1534.  There will be no formal Request For Proposal (RFP) or other Solicitation issued with regards to this requirement.  The Navy reserves the right to select for award any, all, part of, or none of the responses received and intends to incrementally fund any resultant contract(s), depending on available funding. The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs for responding to this BAA. Responses should be forwarded at no cost to the Government.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Educational institutions, Small Business concerns, Small Dis-Advantaged Business concerns, Women Owned Small Business Concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions are especially encouraged to submit proposals for consideration under this BAA.  Note:  Only the Contracting Officer is authorized to award government contracts.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends on entering into a sole source collaborative agreement with the American Cancer Society (ACS), Center for Tobacco Cessation (CTC), 1599 Clifton Road, NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30329 for the building infrastructure: Secretariat for Adult and Youth Blueprints efforts. The services and supplies herein are being procured using the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The purpose of this initiative is to build on the work, completed to date by NCI and its collaborators, for both the adult and youth blueprints and to support implementation and evaluation through ongoing multi-organization collaborations. The collaborative efforts are described in a National Blueprint for Disseminating and Implementing evidence-Based Clinical and Community strategies to Promote Tobacco Use Cessation, September 2002 ("adult blueprint") and the National Blueprint for Action on Youth and Young Adult Tobacco Use Cessation, Spring 2000 ('youth blueprint").  The objective of the adult blueprint is to disseminate and implement effective methods of tobacco cessation among adults and the purpose of the youth blueprint is to develop the science base on effective methods of tobacco cessation interventions for youth.   In addition, Healthy People 2010 has identified that reducing tobacco use for the nation with a goal to improve the health of the U.S. population by reducing cigarette smoking by adults from 24 percent to 12 percent.   The 10-year goal of the youth blueprint is to ensure that every young tobacco user (age 12 - 24) has access to appropriate and effective cessation interventions by the year 2010.  In accomplishing the goals of this project, the contractor shall work with the Youth Tobacco Cessation Collaborative (YTCC) in the coordination of various meetings, workgroup activities, and to establish an executive committee to coordinate collaboration efforts for linkage to adult blueprint activities. The American Cancer Society is the only known source to the NCI with the resources for this effort.  CTC is uniquely qualified to facilitate the implementation process and dissemination of the blueprint recommendations, because of its exclusive focus on the issue of tobacco cessation, its depth of expertise on the many aspects of the issue, and its demonstrated leadership in these areas.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Statistical Research and Applications Branch (SRAB) intends on contracting with Istituto Superiore di Sanit‡Lab. Epidemiologia e Biostatistica, Reparto Indicatori Sorveglianza Sanitaria, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Roma for:  Projection of breast cancer incidence and prevalence in US at state level using Prevalence Incidence Analysis MODel.  The services and supplies herein are being procured using the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M. The objectives are to investigate the performance of the methodology in estimating prevalence at smaller areas than nationally and to provide breast cancer prevalence at the state level. This is a pilot study to estimate Breast Cancer Prevalence at state level. Based the NCI's knowledge there are no estimates of Cancer Prevalence at state level in the US.  Following are the three (3) areas which are essential to success of this agreement:  1) The statistical method denoted by PIAMOD (Prevalence Incidence Analysis MODel) estimates prevalence from incidence and patient survival data has been developed by researchers from the Istituto Superiore di Sanit‡ in Rome, Italy, 2) Age and period cancer incidence at state level can be estimated from ecological regression on socio economic variables, and 3) Breast cancer survival can also be obtained at state level by applying state specific relative risk to SEER breast cancer survival. The state specific relative risks were estimated using ecological regression analysis on survival. Thus, the inputs for the application of the methodology are available (state specific incidence and survival). The effect of hypotheses and approximations involved in the combined estimation procedure of modeling incidence, survival and prevalence needs to be validated in a pre-step using the SEER data.  The Istituto Superiore di Sanita along with Dr. Arduino Verdecchia will be responsible for managing and conducting the research.  Dr. Arduino Verdecchia has developed the methodology and is a leading expert in the development of the methods and application for estimating chronic diseases incidence and prevalence.   He and his group have developed the software, which has been extensively applied to cancer data from Italy, Europe and SEER. This is the only source known to NCI with its unique capabilities to successfully complete this project. .  This is not a request for competitive quotation.

<DESC>T The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on the basis of sole source from Roche Molecular Systems, 1145 Atlantic Avenue, Alameda, California, 94501 Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Linear Array Tests.  The services and supplies herein are being procured using the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  A Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants (SUCCEED) is being conducted to identify biomarkers that would molecularly distinguish women "at risk" of progressive cervical neoplasia.  At present, we are unable to predict with any accuracy, which HPV infections will progress and which will be among the majority that regresses.  The purpose of SUCCEED is to therefore identify biomarkers that would distinguish those women who will process to cervical neoplasia from the majority that will not.  As part of the enrollment criteria, women will be categorized according to their HPV status.  Roche Molecular Systems produces a HPV genotyping assay, the HPV Linear Array Tests, that are crucial to the main objectives for SUCCEED.  Women enrolled in SUCCEED will be categorized by their HPV status, which will determine the success of enrollment goals as well as serve as a critical definition for long-term analyses.  Roche Molecular system is the only source known to the NCI offering high-throughput HPV testing kits that will allow, by a PCR amplification-based assay), the simultaneous distinction of 37 specific HPV types (including 6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 84).  This ability is essential to the goals of SUCCEED.  The HPV Linear Array Tests are the only array tests known that are proprietary to Roche Molecular Systems.   This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on the basis of sole source from Cytyc Corp., 85 Swanson Road, Boxhorough, Massachusetts, Thin Prep Pap Test and Thin Prep Pap Laboratory Packages.  The services and supplies herein are being procured using the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 423450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants (SUCCEED) is being conducted to identify biomarkers that would molecularly distinguish women "at risk" of progressive cervical neoplasia.  The purpose of SUCCEED is to therefore identify biomarkers that would distinguish those women who will process to cervical neoplasia from the majority that will not.  Collection of cervical cells using the ThinPrep Packages will allow sufficient amount of cervical cells to be collected for both HPV testing and the preparation of two liquid based cytologic slides.   A consistent and systematic method is required for HPV testing and cytologic screening throughout the study. The method will be used in concert with histologic diagnosis to identify women by HPV status with progressive diagnoses (cancer, precancer, low-grade lesions to normal).  The comparison of molecular and genetic characteristics in tissue specimens (and other biospecimens) between women by diagnostic category and HPV status is the basis for SUCCEED.  The ThinPrep Pap Test Package and Laboratory Packages are essential for the conduct of SUCCEED.  A total of 2000 ThinPrep Pap Test Packages and 2000 ThinPrep Pap Test Laboratory Packages are needed to allow the collection, storage, and development of cytologic slides and specimens for HPV testing for SUCCEED goals.  Cytyc Corporation is the source only known to the NCI with the capabilities to produce and distribute the ThinPrep Pap test packages for this study.   These are the only known collection kits that will allow the collection of a large enough quantity of cells to make two liquid-based Pap slides needed for research purposes and use a gentle enough collection tool for further procedures.  In addition, it is only known kit that will also simultaneously allow NCI to take two aliquots for HPV testing by the method we have indicated for the study.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if he party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1 PM, EST, on September 22, 2003.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Cancer Prevention Studies Branch (CPSB) plans to procure supplies and services for Extraction of DNA, quantitation and aliquoting  from BioServe Biotechnologies, 1050 West Street, Laurel, Maryland 20707.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  CPSB conducted the Cytology Sampling Study 2 (CSS2), a large, population-based screening study in Linxian, China, which enrolled approximately 750 subjects.  During this study, subjects underwent balloon cytology screening, exams, provided a number of biological samples and then underwent endoscopy with biopsy so that the worst histologic diagnosis could be determined for each subject.   As a result, valuable biologic samples that can be used in the testing of molecular markers that can be developed into a primary screening tools for esophageal cancer were produced.  The purpose of this procurement is to obtain DNA from specially frozen cytology cells from the CSS2 study.  This service will aid the CPSB in the development of screening assays for esophageal cancer.  BioServe Biotechnologies has previously provided DNA extraction services for sensitive samples that had been corrupted during acquisition in the field and these samples required special handling.  DNA was successfully extracted from these samples and has been put to use in a number of subsequent studies.  The current study uses cells collected under unusual conditions and are from a large, complex, field study that required extensive planning, and a large labor commitment.  These samples are very precious and could not be recollected.  Therefore, we require the services of a contractor with previously demonstrated capacity to handle delicate samples and produce DNA of good quality.  BioServe Biotechnologies is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned service above.  This is not a notice for competitive quotations.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a three (3) month extension to the current Aircraft Operation and Maintenance Contract.  This extension will provide MSFC the required Acquisition Lead Time to complete the recompetition of its Aircraft Operation and Maintenance requirement.  The recompetition is being conducted under FAR Part 8.4 using the GSA's Federal Supply Schedule No. 874V, Logistics Worldwide.  The extension is needed because the recompetition was delayed due to the additional time required to gather and validate information regarding the operation of a later model aircraft being used by MSFC (a Gulfstream II versus the Gulfstream I).  Given the safety and operational requirements surrounding the day-to-day operation of a passenger-carrying aircraft, the issuance of a competitive procurement to cover the 3-month period is considered impractical.  As such, MSFC intends to purhase the services from the Bionetics Corporation, Newport News, Virginia, under the authority of a Justification pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1). The Aircraft Operation and Maintenance contract furnishes the necessary management, personnel, equipment, and materials (not otherwise provided by the Government) which provides safe, efficient operation, and maintenance of the MSFC aircraft.  The work can be broken down into the following elements: Operation in accordance with NASA and Federal Standards (to include the provision of federally-qualified flight crews) and Maintenance (compliant with all applicable Federal standards for the aircraft being maintained). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) plans to procure on a sole source basis with the British Columbia Cancer Agency and the Children Cancer Foundation of Ohio to obtain access of data to create the required tissue microarrays for research on ovarian cancer for the evaluation of prognostic and predictive markers.  The Cancer Diagnosis Program has overall responsibility for planning, evaluation and coordination of NCI research related to cancer diagnostics.  This program is charged with facilitating research using human specimens and patient data to advance cancer diagnostics.  One way to accomplish this is to create sets of reference tissues that can be used by researchers to evaluate specific cancer biomarkers.  Ovarian Cancer accounts for 4 percent of all cancers in women and expected to result in 25,400 new cases and 14,300 deaths in 2003.  The availability of ovarian cancer tissue microarrays will faciliate research on markers.  The work to be performed requires access to appropriate specimens to create the required tissue microarrays.  The British Columbia Cancer Agency has access to specimens with extensive associated data from more than 3,500 patients with various stages of ovarian cancer and the expertise to create high quality tissue microarrays.  Additionally, this agency has access to another unique collection of more than 400 cases (patents) with matched specimens from the same patients taken before and after chemotherapy.  Tissue Microarrays made from the data for different treatement regimens would be most usefull for studies of prevalence and efficacy of markers for predicting response to treatment.  The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) is supported by the NCI to conduct phase III clinical trials of gynecologic cancer.  The GOG repository located at the Children's Research Institute, 7000 Children's Drive, Columbus, Ohio provides a set of archival clinical trials specimens with extensive data.  The bank includes more than 3,000 cases (patients) to provide high quality specimens for a variety of disease sub-types.  Tissue microarrays made from this material would be extremely useful for studies of unique markers related to subtypes of disease, stage progression and prognosis.  The above two specific groups have been identified as having the complimentary sets of ovarian tissue blocks, patients data and the ability to construct tissue mircroarrays.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capaiblites.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statments must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 P.M., EDT, on September 22, 2003. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or e-mailed to Cynthia Brown(brownc@rcb.nci.nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code:541990.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Data Procurement Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Ukrainian State Air Traffic Service Enterprise, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: CNS/ATM Transition Planñ Eurasia Regional  :  The Ukrainian State Air Traffic Service Enterprise (UkSATSE) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for a regional Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) Transition Plan in Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova.

The aviation sectors of these five countries are in need of planning assistance to design and implement modern air traffic services systems that will correspond to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices and EUROCONTROL regional requirements.  All five countries have identified this as a key priority for the region.  The upgrade will allow for the more efficient utilization of the air transportation network in the five countries, as well as allow them to upgrade to satellite-based systems, in accordance with industry trends.

To achieve this goal, the Air Navigation Service Providers of the five countries have already established the Regional Air Navigation Services Development Association and are planning to work together to modernize their communications and navigations systems, as well as design and implement modern ATM systems that are compliant with ICAO and EUROCONTROL requirements.  

In September 2002, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funded a Definitional Mission (DM) to Ukraine, which is acting as coordinator of the project, to assess the upgrades that all five countries have made or are planning to implement and concluded that pooled efforts in this sector would be beneficial to each country in achieving its national goals in the field.  The aim of this feasibility study is to assist Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova in addressing one of the non-technical problems that will be encountered in the adoption of the new CNS/ATM system, namely, the establishment of a regional plan of cooperation that will facilitate an efficient and cost-effective transition from the old to the new system of ATM.  

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this feasibility study will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $666,830 grant to UkSATSE from USTDA.  
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firmís name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host countries (Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Moldova).   The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host countries for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to UkSATSE c/o USTDA by 4:00 P.M. September 30, 2003, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  UkSATSE reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  UkSATSE also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  UkSATSE is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) requests submission of SF 254s and 255s by architectural-engineering firms desiring to be considered for government contracts not to exceed $100,000.  A permanent Architect-Engineer Selection Board shall maintain an A-E qualifications data file.  Each firm will be classified with respect to: (1) Location; (2) Specialized Experience; (3) Professional Capabilities; (4) Capacity; and, (5) Past Performance.  The file shall be reviewed and updated annually with additional firms and with revised information from firms already in the file.  Projects may consist of broad based architect-engineering services to include, but not limited to: site analysis, evaluation and development; CADD services; sound system design; audio visual system design; courtroom technologies; mechanical, electrical, and architectural design; and historical preservation studies.  Potential projects may be geographically located in the 50 United States and the U.S. Territories.  Individual projects will be awarded to firms based on the following criteria:     (1) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3)  Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; and (5) Past performance on contracts with the judiciary, other government entities, and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.   In making the award determination the Architect-Engineer Selection Board will rank the firms most qualified to perform the work and provide its list to the Contracting Officer (CO) who will review it, make the final selection list, attempt to negotiate a fair and reasonable price with the firm ranked first and, if successful, award to that firm.  If unsuccessful, the CO will attempt to negotiate with the next firm on the list and so forth, until award is made or it is necessary to request an additional listing from the selection board.  This process will continue until award is accomplished.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR Mechanism Analysis Software System. Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to respond the questions and provide clarification. On the Specifications attachment, section 2.0 Scope, 7th bullet.  A training program is no longer apart of this requirement.  Prospective quoters may disregard the 7th bullet in its entirety. Questions and Answers: Question 1. Under Section 3.1 fourth bullet, the phrase "All defined stiffness and strength information shall be maintained.", please provide clarification of this requirement.   Answer 1:	Information defined in Pro/Engineer with the geometry such as material properties that contain stiffness and/or strength values shall be maintained with the geometry in the translation. A simple geometry translation that loses pre-defined properties is not adequate. Question 2.  Under Section 3.2 third bullet, the phrase "The software shall be capable of follower force analysis.", please provide clarification of this requirement.    Answer 2:	The software shall be capable of analysis in which the force is dynamically updated to accommodate the deflection in the structure.  For example, a tip load on a wing can either be constant in direction (eg. gravity), or it can "follow" the deflection of the tip and remain normal to the surface.  The due date for receipt of offers is extended to September 10, 2003. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on September 10, 2003. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on the World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

PURPOSE:  

BWXT Y-12, L.L.C. (BWXT Y-12), acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22800 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE) at the Y-12 National Security Complex, is soliciting Statements of Qualification (SOQ) for the construction of a new building/facility known as, ì9720-82î, at the Y-12 National Security Complex located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The value of the facility construction is estimated to be in the range of $40 to $60 million dollars.  It is the intent of BWXT Y-12 to secure a construction firm capable of performing the required construction activities for this project.
 
This notice to solicit Statements of Qualification does not constitute an invitation for sealed bids or a request for proposal.  This request is for the purpose of determining interested and qualified firms.  Responses received will be evaluated to determine the shortlist of firms to receive the Request for Proposals (RFP). Technical documents for this project will contain Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information and Official Use Only information which requires special information security preparations on the part of the shortlisted firms prior to receiving the RFP. All subcontractor personnel working on this project must be United States citizens. Offerors must be able to obtain a favorable Foreign Ownership, Control, or Interest (FOCI) determination from the Government in order to be eligible for subcontract award.

If you do not respond to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ), you will not be eligible for the subsequent procurement actions. The forecast for issuing the Request for Proposals is January 2004.

DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT & SCOPE OF WORK:   
  
The planned building footprint is approximately 450 feet by 300 feet with a height of approximately 40 feet. See Attachment 1 for artistës rendering. The construction site is approximately 7 acres and is at the Y-12 National Security Complex. Physical access to the site will be from Tennessee State Route 95 and Bear Creek Road West. The work location does not require Q-Cleared workers, but all construction personnel must be United States citizens with assigned identification badges and vehicle passes. Construction work at the Y-12 National Security Complex requires the successful firm to become signatory to the Construction Labor Agreement with the Knoxville Building and Construction Trades Council. 

Work scope consists of procurement of materials and installation of the following:  

Site Work--Excavation and backfill for underground utilities, grading, underground and above ground utility installation, trenches, access roads, erosion control, and site restoration.

Civil/StructuralóAdministrative offices, mechanical/electrical and storage areas consisting of seismically qualified, cast in place, reinforced concrete building foundations, walls, and columns, structural steel racks/supports, roofing, and loading docks.

PROCUREMENT PROCESS:  

BWXT Y-12 intends to award an evaluated competitive firm-fixed price subcontract to the successful offeror that best meets the projectís goals and objectives.  Selection will be based on best-value using a two-phased approach of a Request for Qualifications and a Request for Proposals. Phase 1 (Request for Qualifications) will request that firms respond to evaluation factors regarding Past Performance & Experience, Technical Capabilities, and Organization & Personnel Qualifications. From the responses received, BWXT Y-12 will evaluate and score the Statements of Qualification against the RFQ evaluation criteria to down-select to a shortlist of firms to receive the Request for Proposals.  No pricing is to be included in Phase 1. Notices will be forwarded to offerors upon completion of the SOQ evaluations to inform them if they made the shortlist to receive the RFP. 

Offerors selected to receive the RFP must comply with BWXT Y-12 information security requirements prior to receiving the design documents. Phase 2 (Request for Proposals) will request that firms respond to technical evaluation factors such as, but not limited to, Project Management Plan & Business Management, Organization & Personnel, and Socioeconomic and Affirmative Action Plans and provide Pricing. The basis for award will be the firm offering the best overall value, considering price, the technical RFP submittals, and the SOQs evaluated under the Request for Qualification. Subcontract award is anticipated in September 2004, but will ultimately depend on the availability of funding.

<DESC>**Minor changes**The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) plans to procure on a sole source basis with the British Columbia Cancer Agency and the Children Cancer Foundation of Ohio to create the required tissue microarrays for research on ovarian cancer for the evaluation of prognostic and predictive markers.  The Cancer Diagnosis Program has overall responsibility for planning, evaluation and coordination of NCI research related to cancer diagnostics.  This program is charged with facilitating research using human specimens and patient data to advance cancer diagnostics.  One way to accomplish this is to create sets of reference tissues that can be used by researchers to evaluate specific cancer biomarkers.  Ovarian Cancer accounts for 4 percent of all cancers in women and expected to result in 25,400 new cases and 14,300 deaths in 2003.  The availability of ovarian cancer tissue microarrays will faciliate research on markers.  The work to be performed requires access to appropriate specimens to create the required tissue microarrays.  The British Columbia Cancer Agency has access to specimens with extensive associated data from more than 3,500 patients with various stages of ovarian cancer and the expertise to create high quality tissue microarrays.  Additionally, this agency has access to another unique collection of more than 400 cases (patents) with matched specimens from the same patients taken before and after chemotherapy.  Tissue Microarrays made from the data for different treatement regimens would be most usefull for studies of prevalence and efficacy of markers for predicting response to treatment.  The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) is supported by the NCI to conduct phase III clinical trials of gynecologic cancer.  The GOG repository located at the Children's Research Institute, 700 Children's Drive, Columbus, Ohio provides a set of archival clinical trials specimens with extensive data.  The bank includes more than 3,000 cases (patients) to provide high quality specimens for a variety of disease sub-types.  Tissue microarrays made from this material would be extremely useful for studies of unique markers related to subtypes of disease, stage progression and prognosis.  The above two specific groups have been identified as having the complimentary sets of ovarian tissue blocks, patients data and the ability to construct tissue mircroarrays.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement and the noted features, it may submit a statement of capaiblites.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statments must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 P.M., EDT, on September 22, 2003. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or e-mailed to Cynthia Brown(brownc@rcb.nci.nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code:541990.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION


The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) seeks information related to its Corporate Financial System Modernization initiative. This is a Request For Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP). USDA intends to assess the capabilities and then issue an RFP at a later date to those GSA contractors it determines to be the most capable. Acquisition is currently planned to begin in FY2005.  Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such. 


BACKGROUND
USDA maintains a diverse and complex portfolio of over twenty-five financial and associated administrative systems. The Corporate Financial Management Sys-tems (CFMS) portfolio represents a corporate-wide solution for financial man-agement reform mandated by various statutes and regulations and establishes a basis for sound financial management at USDA.  In addition, the CFMS portfolio helps to ensure and produce complete, reliable, timely, and consistent financial information that lead to clean audited financial statements.  The key goal is to provide tools for program and financial managers to effectively manage and evaluate federal programs.  
At the core of the CFMS is the the Foundation Financial Information System (FFIS), the USDA corporate administrative financial information system imple-mented by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), Associate Chief Fi-nancial Officer for Financial Systems (ACFO-FS). The FFIS system includes a USDA-configured version of the commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Federal Fi-nancial System (FFS).  The FFS vendor has already developed and is marketing its new generation of core accounting system software, and will eventually dis-continue support of the old version of FFS. Consequently, USDA must replace FFIS with a system that complies with a contemporary "open system architec-ture". The CFMS also includes the Financial Data Warehouse (FDW) and the Fi-nancial Statements Data Warehouse (FSDW), the USDA financial reporting solutions, and the two data marts, the Automated Cash Reconciliation Worksheet System (ACRWS), the FFIS Customer Service Center (CSC), and more than 15 financial and administrative ìfeederî systems. The FDW and FSDW address the financial management reporting requirements in USDA. ACRWS provides criti-cal cash management and reconciliation capabilities to resolve the USDA's long-standing cash reconciliation issues. The CSC is the customer outreach to the fi-nancial management and technical communities and maintains a database of all trouble reports. 
The COTS software for FFIS was chosen in 1994 from the mandatory Financial Management System Software (FMSS) Multiple Award Schedule. COTS soft-ware is required as specified in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circu-lar, A-130, "Management of Federal Information Resources". The implementation of FFIS serves as the corporate financial systems initiative for the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to achieve compliance with the CFO Act of 1990 and provides the functionality to implement the U.S. Standard General Ledger. It also addressed the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) sys-tem requirements and the consolidated reporting requirements for financial state-ments stated in OMB Circular A-127, "Financial Management Systems."
To further improve program performance and ensure that it can meet future needs, the USDA OCF) has determined that USDA needs to obtain a new core financial management system that can meet OMB circulars A-127 and A-130 for sensitive but unclassified standard general ledger. . In particular, the OCFO is seeking to replace FFIS with a JFMIP-certified commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) package, with minimal customizations, that will provide online, real-time transaction and information capability and will be accessible to the central office and all bureaus. The Corporate Financial Management System initiative to be implemented is made up of the following functional areas:
General ledger
Cash Management
Grants
Loans
Accounts receivable
Accounts payable
Lockboxes
Funds management
Budget formulation
Salary Projections
Budget and performance integration
Budget planning
Budget execution
Cost management
Reporting
Treasury and Financial Management Service (FACTS 33/2108s)
OMB reporting
Agency reporting
Program reports
IRS reporting (e.g., 1099s, W02s)
Interfaces
Compliance with eGovernment initiatives (e.g., eTravel, Federal Asset Sales, Integrated Acquisition Environment, etc.)

The Corporate Financial System Modernization initiative is a complex, large-scale financial management system acquisition and implementation effort. Among other things, it will require integration with financial and administrative feeder systems, realignment of affected business processes, and clear communication to stakeholders. A successful Corporate Financial Systems Modernization will result in improved financial management reporting, accountability, and decision making throughout USDA and its agencies. It will also further USDAís implementation of key provisions in the Presidentís Management Agenda, eGov requirements, and other regulatory mandates
USDA is pursuing an efficient and integrated approach that builds on government, industry, and project management best practices for acquiring a COTS financial management package and the system integration expertise to implement it. 
At its core, this approach will use a performance-based acquisition strategy that is based on effective planning and requirements gathering consistent with USDA IT policy and system development lifecycle (SDLC) guidance, and Capability Maturity Model (CMM) level 2 or higher processes. USDA plans to manage the Corporate Financial Systems Modernization using critical components of earned-value management methods for program planning, reporting, and management.


USDA Goals
Among the specific goals established for this initiative are the following:
Acquire a new core financial management system that is qualified by the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP)
Provide real-time interfaces to eGovernment initiatives such as eTravel.
Ensure accuracy of reported financial data (as evidenced by unqualified audit opinions by the Office of the Inspector General for all USDA pub-lished financial statements) through the systems that prepare the state-ments
Meet EAL3 security requirements.
Satisfy the requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improve-ment Act
Satisfy the requirements of the Government Management Reform Act
Proactively implement the challenges identified in the Presidentís Man-agement Agenda for improving overall financial management of all fed-eral agencies
Integration of financial, budget, and performance information to support decision making
Satisfy other applicable external (outside USDA) reporting requirements such as OMB circulars A127, A123 and A130
Satisfy the Secretaryís 21st Century and Competitive Workforce priorities
Provide increased analytical reporting capabilities to system users
Centralize and standardize financial management information to ensure that USDA complies with federally mandated requirements for core ac-counting and financial management and meets its business information needs.

Tires are to be tested to the specifications in SAEJ2014.  Testing will be done IAW Mission Profile of the HMMWV, 30% Secondary, 30% Primary and 40% Off Road to include 10,000 Miles Durability Test and Compatibility test to Base Line Tires.  The Government will not charge the manufacturers for this testing, but we are requesting that each manufacturer provide 20 tires to the test location free of charge.  The test site will need to receive these tires within 10 days after notifica tion that the tire(s) will be tested. Due to funding limitation for these tests and time constraints, based on responses to this synopsis, the Government may determine that it is not economically feasible to test all candidate tires.

GENERAL REQUIREMENT.  Familiarity and previous direct participation in the varied and complex environmental, technical and management issues associated with the Channel Improvement Project is required. Review the existing conceptual models that describ e the relationship between estuarine condition and salmon population structure and resilience (e.g., Table S6-1, USACOE 2003). The review will focus on the relevance and potential application of the conceptual models to designing a framework for adaptive e nvironmental management (AEM).  The contractor will review and evaluate the content of the Final Supplemental Integrated Feasibility Report and Environmental Impact Statement (USACOE 2003) for contents directly applicable to the design of a framework for P roject AEM.  Meetings with representatives of the Services and other stakeholders will discuss and identify mutual issues and concerns in the development of an AEM process for the Project.

<SUBJECT>B -- Air Refueling Receiver Aircraft Automatic Identification
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-ARRAAI-090803
<RESPDATE>092203
<ARCHDATE>10072003
<CONTACT>Michael Corson, Air Mobility Warfare Center - Senior Operations Analyst, Phone (609)754-7609, Fax (609)754-7651, Email michael.corson@mcguire.af.mil
<DESC>The US Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to automatic identification of receiver aircraft during in-flight refueling.  The technology, with minimal adaptation, must automatically capture information from the receiver aircraft, as required by the tanker aircraft refueling operator, to process in-flight refueling transactions.  The in-flight refueling operator will use the information to complete the Department of Defense Form 791, DoD IN-FLIGHT ISSUE LOG.  The information required from the receiver aircraft includes customer organization/squadron code and home station, Major Command, aircraft type, aircraft identifying tail or bureau number, and Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC).  U.S. Air Force tanker aircraft dispense fuel while in-flight to receiver aircraft, including other US military service and foreign government military aircraft.  For electromagnetic and radio frequency (RF) technologies, the data transmission distance is estimated to be 150 feet, however, the signal strength must not pass beyond 1,000 feet.  For infrared (IR) TV or lowlight TV camera recording technologies, some receiver aircraft have no external markings, i.e.; tail number, home station, etc.  If data or images are stored and downloaded for each mission, then total memory must permit storage of 20 transactions.  Other requirements:  the equipment used must be able to operate with high reliability in the in-flight refueling environment involving speeds in excess of 400 knots; at 20,000 ft. and above; at temperatures ranging from -60 degrees to +130 degrees centigrade; and with minimal light.  The technology must permit the independent identification of two aircraft receiving fuel simultaneously while other receiver aircraft in the immediate vicinity await refueling service.  Since the technology must be compatible with both refueling boom and probe and drogue refueling methods, contact data transfer technologies may not be feasible.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration.  The primary selection criteria for all submissions will be the most practical system available to support the requirements.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  Currently, there is only limited Battlelab funding identified for this program, however, if research indicates that the technology is available and transferable to the USAF, funding may be sought for prototype demonstration and recommended to Headquarters, Air Mobility Command. NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 22 September 2003.  White papers should not exceed five pages plus cover letter.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to Mr. Tim Dabbs of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at dabbst@ctc.com or by mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  The single point of contact concerning this Sources Sought Notice is Mr. Dabbs.  You may contact Mr. Dabbs with any questions you may have at (814) 269-2828.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL BAA INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated.  This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.  For copyright purposes, offerors are also advised that submitting a proposal implies express permission for Concurrent Technologies Corporation personnel to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the received proposals for the report back to the client.

<SUBJECT>10 -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/INITIAL COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, AND COMPUTER (C4) CONCEPT CALL FOR THE NEXT GENERATION LAND BASED STATEGIC DETERRENT (LBSD)  ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES (AoA)
<DESC>Land Based Strategic Deterrent (LBSD) Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) Systems Request for Information (RFI).  Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is investigating potential concepts to support the LBSD Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Study for the next generation deterrent system.  This RFI initiates a concept call for transformational Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) Systems concepts meeting the Land Based Strategic Nuclear Deterrent Mission Need Statement (MNS) and LBSD Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  Concepts should address enhanced performance, decreased manpower, and reduced maintenance and operations footprint.  Commensurate with this concept call, this RFI requests an assessment of the feasibility, technical maturity, and growth potential of the enabling technologies for each concept.  This is one of multiple RFIs that will address the entire next generation deterrent system.  The Air Force (AF) anticipates a future competitive evolutionary acquisition program starting in 2005 or 2006 to begin replacing the existing system in 2018. 

This RFI includes Command, Control, Communications, and Computer (C4) Systems that operate in and between the following areas:  primary launch center(s), launcher location(s), alternate launch system(s) and in-flight.  The next generation deterrent system may be based in existing Minuteman III (MM III) silos, with new or significantly updated supporting C4 infrastructure, where necessary.  The system may also use innovative deployment and basing strategies in addition to or in place of existing MM III silos, including but not limited to, mobile basing, fixed basing with mobile elements, new silo schema, etc.  

LBSD C4 infrastructure will enable the highest technically feasible data transfer rates to facilitate unbroken, survivable (e.g., hardened, redundant), high quality communications for the next generation deterrent system (both on ground and in flight).  Communications availability, reliability and bandwidth capacity should be commensurate with missions, threats and hostile events in order to provide real-time retargeting, automated report back transmission, and remote status monitoring.  Existing C4 infrastructure may be leveraged where life cycle support, interfaces, and information exchange capabilities are feasible.  Operations, maintenance and logistics concepts should be addressed.  A description of how the conceptual LBSD C4 infrastructure interoperates with the overarching national C4, Global Information Grid, and Transformational Communications infrastructures should be addressed.  The proposed LBSD C4 technical infrastructure should comply with the DoD Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) and the AF Infostructure Technical Reference Model (i-TRM).  All concepts should comply with the DoD Architecture Framework and the AF Enterprise Architecture Framework.   

AFSPC is soliciting Concepts from Industry, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, AF Labs and Product Centers.  Any on-going C4 studies (e.g., Advanced Technology Concept Demonstrations) should be examined.  The AoA study may construct Government alternatives from concepts submitted in response to this RFI.  Alternatives will be evaluated based on cost and effectiveness. Effectiveness is assessed against the Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) and Measures of Performance (MOPs) in the AoA Study Plan.  Results of the AoA will be provided to key decision makers in anticipation of a future acquisition, but the government does not anticipate releasing the results.  

Interested parties should visit the LBSD website at www.hill.af.mil/icbm/lm4 to register and obtain additional information.  The website contains the MNS, MOEs and MOPs, unclassified background information, desired system characteristics, acronyms, list of registered interested parties, industry day information, as well as other information related to this effort.  Access to classified weapon system information and Department of Defense Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information will only be available to registered parties with appropriate security clearances on site at the ICBM SPO at Hill AFB, UT.  

RFI submissions should include:  1) A concept overview with description, diagrams, and interfaces; 2) Capabilities of the concept, mapped to the key attributes and the enabling technology with associated maturity needed to implement; 3) To the extent possible, life cycle costs/schedule associated with RDT&E, Procurement, Sustainment and Disposal; 4) Key performance characteristics to enable effective modeling and assessment; 5)  Additional information or recommendations.  Respondents are required to submit concepts via the format found at the website.  Please limit company overviews associated with the submissions to two (2) pages, classified information up to Top Secret may be submitted in separate appendices and marked accordingly.  Total submissions should not exceed 50 pages for each concept.  Provide five hard copies and four electronic copies (on compact discs).  The evaluation team will use Microsoft Office 2000 or Adobe Acrobat Reader for evaluating electronic submissions.  Proprietary RFI submissions will be protected consistent with markings.  Responses are due by 5:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, 21 November 2003.  

The Government anticipates an AoA Industry Day (ID) prior to submittal of the concepts.  This ID will further describe the Governmentís AoA activities and vision for the future, and provide the opportunity for questions and answers.  Details for this ID will be provided at the website.  Questions may be addressed via the website.  After the submission of the concepts, additional opportunities for questions/answers with registered individual respondents are anticipated. 

THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Governmentís use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractorís input resulting from this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI may be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the AoA.  The information provided may be utilized by the Air Force in developing its acquisition strategy and in its Statement of Objective and Performance Specifications.  The information resulting from this RFI may be included/combined with other submissions in one or more alternatives considered in the AoA study.  Any proprietary information that is submitted may be used in establishing requirements of the future system but specific information will be safeguarded as proprietary.   

Please note:  Submissions may be viewed by non-Government personnel.  Under separate action the Air Force may contract to provide services such as technical, evaluation, and acquisition management support.  Any such service contracts will contain an organizational conflict of interest clause that requires service contractors to protect the data and prohibits the service contractors from using the data for any purpose other than that for which the data was presented.  Such contractor(s) may be precluded from proposing on LBSD.
