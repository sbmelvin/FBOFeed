Approximately 140,000 of these vehicles are light-duty carrier route vehicles (CRVs) manufactured between 1987 anad 1994 from the Grumman Corp.  These vehicles, known as Long Life Vehicles (LLVs), are rear drive, 4 cylinder, aluminum body-on-frame vehicles with a payload capacity of approximately 1,400 lbs.  The LLVs are nearing the end of their useful life and the USPS intends to retire this fleet over the next 12 to 14 years and replace them with new, similarly sized vehicles.  The new vehicles will be referred to as Generation 3 (G3) Carrier Route Vehicles, and this procurement is termed the "G3" procurement.  USPS intends to make an award for up to 200,000 CRVs, awarding a "base-level" contract of 4 years with 3 option provisions.  Any resulting contract is contingent upon approval of funding by the USPS Board of Governors.  Solicitation package for 1DVPLE-05-A-3001 can be downloaded by accessing either the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov or via the USPS G3 Procurement Program website www.uspsg3.com (login:  industry; password:  questions).  No telephone inquiries will be entertained.  All questions or requests for clarification must be via the website at www.uspsg3.com.  Proposals are due May 2, 2005.

<DESC>Contractor will implement electronic Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) in labs within NCID in order to satisfy the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) need for specimen tracking and collaboration (sharing of results and other information).  Approximately 15% of applicable CDC labs now have the StarLIMS system in place.  StarLIMS was previously chosen to begin the implementation process.  It would not be in the best interest of CDC to enter into another contract with a contractor other that StarLIMS to complete the LIMS project.  Consequently, it is believed that StarLIMS is the sole source having the capabilities which will meet the above mentioned requirements of CDC.  It is the intent of CDC to award a purchase order with StarLIMS if this is found to be true.

In addition to the normal development and humanitarian efforts, a large reconstruction program was begun in the fall of 2005 in response to the disastrous results of Tropical Storm Jeanne.  The normal strategic plan end date would have been 2004.  Due to the extraordinary situation in the country, the strategic plan end date has been extended to 2006.

<DESC>The U.S. assistance program in Haiti supports United States’ national security interests.  The development landscape is one of the most challenging in the world.   While other countries in the region with similar development profiles thirty-five years ago have achieved middle-income status, Haiti remains the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.  With a turbulent political history, frequent changes of governments, an extraordinarily high concentration of economic wealth, and a citizenry that lacks both confidence and trust in its public institutions, Haiti faces challenges that few nations of the 21st century know.  Consequently, the U.S. Government has made substantial financial investments for many years in the country’s development, particularly in the areas of economic growth, democratic institutions, health (including the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS), food security, disaster mitigation, and humanitarian assistance.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation to acquire leadership and organization development consulting and services for employees of NGA.  All contractor personnel shall have a Top Secret Clearance/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access.  The anticipated contract will be firm-fixed price and will include a base year plus four (4) one-year option periods. The period of performance will be from date of contract award (estimated to be March 2006) through March 2011, including options.   This acquisition will be solicitated and awarded utilizing FAR subpart 12, Commercial Acquisitions, procedures.  Leadership and organization development consulting and services provide assistance to NGA leaders throughout the organization by helping them address a multiplicity of challenges including: downsizing; outsourcing; facility closures; office realignments; new business processes; and production integration.  These challenges come at a time when NGA is focused on coping with a smaller workforce; recruiting and retaining top talent; keeping abreast of leading edge technology; and working with a workforce diverse in culture and learning styles.  Current Agency leadership and organization development consulting and services include:  Change Management, Organizational Restructuring, Leadership Development, Strategic Planning, Creative Problem Solving, Interpersonal Communication, Team Building, Workforce Diversity and Group Facilitation.  This requirement is a 100 % small business set-aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification code is 611430, size standard is $6,000,000.  Proposals received from other than small business concerns will not be accepted.  The Government intends to award without discussion but reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary in making the award decision. Offerors are highly encouraged to submit their best proposals, ensuring full compliance with solicitation requirements (e.g., required fill-ins, Reps & Certs, instructions to offerors, etc).  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror determined the most advantageous to the government considering past performance, price and price-related factors.  Techniques utilizing past performance information and price will be evaluated; therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror. Solicitation HM1576-06-R-0006 is scheduled for release on or about 25 January 2006, with a closing date of 24 February 2006. No telephone, fax, email or mailed requests for the RFP will be honored. The solicitation (and any amendments) will be available for downloading on the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS), website at https://www.fedteds.gov for all interested parties. It is the responsibility of each offeror to review web pages at Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), (http://www.fbo.gov) and FedTeDS (https://www.fedteds.gov) for notice of amendments, updates or changes to current information.  Any prospective offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.   Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) now requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, whether before or after RFP closing, with no obligations. Proposal preparation cost will be borne by offerors submitting proposals in response to the solicitation. Solicitation will include Statement of Work (SOW).

<DESC>The Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is competing a new contract for support services for interdisciplinary studies in clinical cancer genetics targeting families with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, a model for familial cancer. The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of family studies and field (case-control and cohort) studies. Although the scientific design and oversight of the activities are the responsibility of the Clinical Genetics Branch professional staff, the major activities of the contract provide:  1) nursing support including contacting family members, explaining the studies, enrolling family members, obtaining clinical information and records, requesting pathology slides for diagnosis confirmation, arranging for family members to be evaluated by CGB investigators in the Cancer Genetics Clinic at the NIH Clinical Center, performing phlebotomy, obtaining other biologic specimens as necessary, arranging and conducting field trips to evaluate family members, verifying information for the family registry database, maintaining tracking systems for data and biologic specimens, developing and providing educational materials for participants, and participating in genetic counseling and risk notification; 2) maintenance of a locked medical record room to which CGB investigators have immediate access; 3) development of coordination and liaison at a local or international level with collaborating investigators or institutions whose cooperation is needed for the conduct of a study; 4) assistance in the design and pilot testing of forms required for field investigations (e.g., questionnaires, abstracting forms, coding forms, manuals for field procedures and other documents); 5) hiring, training and supervision of field personnel (interviewers, abstractors, and others); 6) identification of study subjects, including locating persons at risk of cancer and/or their relatives, selection of controls through such methods as random digit dialing and acquisition of appropriate study population rosters or files; 7) supervision and management of field operations; 8) collecting data (interviewing/record abstraction, biologic specimen collection and processing); 9) data reduction activities (coding, keying, and editing) of data collected into a format suitable for computer analysis; 10) quality control and standardization so that appropriate and valid data result.  The maintenance of a secure record room which allows CGB investigators access to the medical records within 15 minutes is a mandatory requirement. There is also a mandatory requirement of the capability of nearly daily face to face meetings with the CGB staff. It is anticipated that one incrementally funded, cost-reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded for a period of five years, with a required total level of effort of 53,000 direct labor hours. It is anticipated that the Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be available on or about May 31, 2005 with responses due within 30 calendar days following the actual date of issuance of the RFP. The RFP may be accessed via the NCI Research Contract Branch (RCB) website: http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/ under “Current Requests for Proposals”. Award of this project is anticipated by January 17, 2005. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the NCI.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Odim Spectrum Services, 597 The Queensway, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada K9J7J-6, for the acquisition of qualification testing of the gearbox for the Carriage, Stream, and Recovery System (CSTRS) system in flight as well as for resolution of known deficiencies and deficiencies found during testing.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  The winch and custom gearbox were designed and built by ODIM Spectrum.  The custom gearbox used by the winch is a highly modified planetary gearbox with unique operating characteristics.  The ODIM Spectrum design team also designed the rest of the winch system and the winch has many other specialized characteristics including a composite drum with unique grooving.  Being the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), ODIM is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced pers!  onnel necessary to successfully provide the required qualification testing.  The costs associated with having another contractor reverse engineer any parts of the winch system would be excessive and would negate any benefits associated with a competitive procurement.  Therefore it is imperative that this effort is awarded to ODIM Spectrum.  FSC Code:  AD24, NAICS Code:  541330.  Size Standard:  $4.0M

<SUBJECT>F--Contractor Run Wild Horse Adoption Events in the State of Nevada
<SOLNBR>NAR060048
<RESPDATE>022206
<ARCHDATE>01102007
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for contractor run adoption events within the state of Nevada for a base year plus four one year option periods. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for contractor run adoption events. Background - Wild horses and burros on public lands are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of December 15, 1971 (as amended) by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and United States Forest Service (USFS). Excess wild horses and burros are removed from the public lands, as resource conditions and other factors warrant. Once gathered, excess animals are placed in facilities where they are prepared for placement in private maintenance by private citizens within the United States through the Adopt a Horse and Burro program. Generally, a ready adoption market exists for burros; however, adoptions of wild horses have lagged behind in recent years, resulting in a backlog of wild horses available for adoption. This has also led to escalating costs to feed and care for the animals. By increasing the number of successful adoptions through incentive-based private contract adoptions, the number of wild horses held and the cost to care for these animals will decrease. General Services - The objective of this contract is to procure services to conduct competitive-bid wild horse adoption events within the State of Nevada which result in successful placement of 50-100 wild horses in private homes on a yearly basis. The contractor shall provide all the necessary facilities, personnel, equipment and supplies to perform the following general tasks: Develop and execute a plan for marketing and advance promotion of all adoption events, including identifying potential markets and adopters, determining adoption event type/method and selecting event locations within the State of Nevada; Conduct adoption events including arranging for event locations, showcasing offered animals and/or providing/arranging wild horse training demonstrations and providing transportation of offered animals to/from adoption events; Provide necessary corrals, chutes, loading, unloading and handling facilities, delivery, set up and take down of loading, unloading and handling facilities and humane handling and care of animals during transportation to/from and throughout the adoption event; Make a good faith effort to ensure the public and potential adopters are fully aware of BLM's laws, regulations and qualifications to adopt a wild horse; Provide a record keeping system which documents the number and type of animals offered at each event, as well as the number of offered animals adopted or not adopted.  The record system will also track the marketing tool/method identified by the adopter and document the degree of customer (adopter) satisfaction; Coordinate closely with BLM to ensure qualified BLM representative(s) are on-site during all adoption events, place adoption event information on the National Wild Horse and Burro web site calendar of events, coordinate selection, shipping and transportation of offered animals from the designated BLM facility to/from adoption events, etc. Specific Services - The Contractor will: Identify potential markets and adopters within the State of Nevada and develop/implement a marketing and advance promotion plan aimed at the target market/potential adopter pool; Select and execute the marketing tools/methods to promote and market specific adoption events; Identify the adoption event type/method, selected location(s) for each event, and dates of event(s); Market the animals, assuring all marketing products identify the animals as available for adoption under the Bureau of Land Management's Adopt A Horse Program and positively portray BLMs adoption program and the trainability/versatility of the animals; Tailor marketing and advance promotion to promote successful adoptions of wild horses; emphasizing the laws and requirements a potential adopter must meet to qualify to adopt a wild horse; The plan will also outline how offered animals will be showcased and/or demonstrated to the potential market/adopter pool. If the contractor plans to videotape or photograph offered animals for promotional purposes, the contractor will closely coordinate a mutually convenient time with BLM staff at the BLM facility where the offered animals are being held; Any printed or electronic marketing or promotional material or pre-event media contacts or material will prominently display the BLM and Adopt-A- Horse and Burro names and logos and will fairly and objectively represent the goals of the Bureau's Adopt-A-Horse Program. Select the event location (city/town/state) and arrange for a location to hold the event (i.e. Fairgrounds, Rodeo Grounds, etc.); Select the tools/methods to be used to showcase and/or demonstrate the animals to be offered at specific adoption events; Provide transportation of offered animals to/from adoption events. This is not a complete list of the specifications, but a general overview to help prospective offerors decide whether or not to download a copy of the solicitation, which will be available on or about January 24, 2006. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided.  Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Ms. Suzanne McGarity, Washington, DC, to obtain specific intake information to specific units within the hospital, recruitment, guidance and referral services for people in crisis, assessment and research coordination of patients selected for NIMH Family Study of Affective and Anxiety Spectrum Disorders, Protocol 03-M-0211.  

Ms. McGarity has worked at NIH the last two years and has been an asset to the section.  Her background is in clinical psychology and was involved in the development and implementation of the semi-structured diagnostic interview that is being used in the study.  She piloted the interview with research participants, prepared reports and gave feedback to the investigators based on the cases that she piloted.  She participated in the training and supervision of new interviewers, reviewed completed interviews, and provided feedback to those being trained.  

The sole source determination is based upon Ms McGarity thorough training in all of the procedures used in the Family Study including medical history, interviews about headaches (migraines), sleep disorders, and family histories about mood and anxiety disorders in first and second degree relatives of the research participants.  She has excellent interpersonal skills that contribute to her ability to recruit, screen, and interview and retain research participants in addition to working with other staff members.   

Ms. McGarity’s knowledge and experience is essential to the continuation of the research that is ongoing in the Section on Developmental Genetic Psychopathology.  The time-limited nature of this project requires that we have someone trained in the recruitment and screening of study participants and the administration of interviews.  Continuity among staff members is essential to the longitudinal nature of the study and to the completion of the project on schedule. 



The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.

<CONTACT>NATALIA FISHER-JACKSON, Contract Specialist, Phone: (919) 541-3564 , E-Mail: fisher-jackson.natalia@epa.gov
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to provide support for NATA and Risk Assessment Activities within the Integrated Air Program.  The EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  This component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA?s Persistent Bioaccumulative Toxics initiative. The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales, ranging from national-scale to local-scale assessments.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach.   One of the purposes of this contract is to provide support for risk assessment activities associated with the first component of EPA?s air toxics program.  Within the context of this component, EPA evaluates the effects of hazardous and potentially hazardous air pollutants and develops appropriate regulatory strategies. In this role, EPA:  (1) identifies, screens, and characterizes air pollutants to determine which should be evaluated further as candidates for being listed as hazardous;  (2) reviews and evaluates health and/or ecological assessment documents on hazardous air pollutants; (3) performs risk assessments using EPA methods and models, or other methods and/or models if more appropriate to help guide reasoned decision-making; (4) identifies and evaluates alternative control options; (5) gathers information on production, use, emissions, control technology, control cost, and regulatory status to establish appropriate regulatory development priorities; (6) assesses the effectiveness of EPA and State/local programs in controlling hazardous and criteria pollutants; and (7) coordinates with other EPA offices and Federal and State/local programs to develop appropriate single or multimedia (e.g.,  air, water, solid waste, and/or other media) regulations. 	Another purpose of this contract is to provide support for the second, third, and fourth components of EPA?s air toxics program.  This will be accomplished by developing assessment tools, conducting assessments, communicating the results of assessments, and educating the public.  In addition, as EPA moves forward with its air program, the EPA will be examining the air pollution problem in a more integrated fashion (i.e., considering the cumulative effects of air toxics and criteria pollutants across media rather than conducting separate assessments).  This contract will also provide support for these integrated assessments.  EPA anticipates the award of two cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contract with a base period of performance of twelve (12) months, with four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.   The total duration of the proposed contracts is sixty (60) months.  The first contract, will be awarded on the basis of full and open competition which will consist of 5,100 base quantity labor hours and 15,300 optional quantity labor hours for each of the five (5) periods, for a total contract maximum of 102,000 labor hours.  The second contract, will be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside which will consist of 5,100 base quantity labor hours and 15,300 optional quantity labor hours for each of the five (5) periods, for a total contract maximum of 102,000 labor hours.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620  with a size standard of 6.5 million.  This is an invitation to participate in a pre-solicitation conference.    The purpose of the conference is to provide background information concerning the Statement of Work (SOW) to potential offerors and to create an open forum for discussions concerning the objectives of the project.  Any and all questions submitted should be directly related to the DRAFT SOW and technical evaluation criteria.  There will be no discussion of budget at the conference or any other subject matter that does not directly pertain to the DRAFT SOW or technical evaluation criteria.  Both the draft statement of work and evaluation factors are available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  The conference will be held on January 31, 2006 from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM in the Raleigh/Durham area.  Specific location information will be provided upon your confirmation of attendance to the conference, which must occur by 12:00 P.M. (EST) on Jan 24, 2006 via email to Natalia Fisher-Jackson at fisher-jackson.natalia@epa.gov.  Telephone confirmations are not acceptable for this procurement.   Pre-solicitation conference attendance is limited to two (2) individuals that best represent the prospective offeror's company.  Any questions and/or comments that you would prefer not to discuss in a group format due to proprietary reasons should be submitted in writing to Natalia Fisher Jackson via email no later than January 23, 2006 and explicitly labeled ?proprietary?.   EPA handling of such questions/comments and subsequent responses will be handled in accordance with normal agency procedures for protection of proprietary data.  There will be NO reimbursement for travel expenses related to the participation in the pre-solicitation conference.  All responses to questions/comments concerning the DRAFT SOW and technical evaluation criteria discussed at the pre-solicitation conference and not deemed proprietary will be compiled and distributed to all interested parties.  The RFP will be issued approximately March 6, 2006 and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date.  The solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.   If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments. The Government is not obligated or committed to award any contract as a result of this notice.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for two (2) new Miniature Inertial Measurement Units (MIMUs), and the refurbishment of a previously purchased MIMU under the Triana program. NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to Honeywell Incorporated, Space Systems Group.  Honeywell shall deliver two (2) new MIMUs and refurbish a previously purchased Honeywell MIMU, which was purchased under the Triana program.  Honeywell shall provide spacecraft attitude rate measurements to the Attitude Control System, for science grade, fine guidance and emergency Sun Acquisition mode support.  The LRO is required to possess redundant MIMUs and the MIMU Flight Spare units must have identical form, fit and function as the new MIMU flight unit.  Honeywell, as the original vendor of the Triana MIMU, is the only source that can upgrade the existing unit, and build identical Flight Units.  The refurbishment of the MIMU requires the detailed knowledge of Honeywell’s specific proprietary design.	Further, Honeywell is uniquely qualified for this contract because of their extensive expertise and experience with the prior Triana MIMU effort.  This combined with the adherence to the existing project schedule is paramount for us to meet our launch schedule as requested in the President’s Vision for U.S. Space Exploration.	To ensure we meet our October 2008 launch date with acceptable technical and schedule risk, the MIMU procurement must be awarded by early 2006.  The estimated period of performance of this firm-fixed-price (FFP) effort is approximately 14 months.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See Notes 22, 26, and B. Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work, should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations have 15 days from the publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their qualifications/capabilities. Such qualifications/capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Responses received after the 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>Full and Open Competition for a subcontracting opportunity to Clinical Trials & Surveys Corp. (C-TASC),  the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) is currently seeking Offerors for a Radiographic Core Laboratory. The BMDCS is an ongoing 5-year, NICHD-funded study to obtain longitudinal reference bone mineral density measures with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 1554 healthy children (6-16 years old). Total body, spine, hip and forearm DXA scans were performed using Hologic instruments and software at four annual visits.  Additionally, in a small subset of patients QCT and PQCT measures have been obtained.  Furthermore, bone age, height, weight and sexual maturation measures have been obtained annually on each protocol subject annually.  Also, in a small subset of patients, QCT and PQCT measures have been obtained.  Quality assurance (QA) was performed using pediatric phantoms.  The Radiographic Core Laboratory reads each DXA and QA measurement, insures that it is of adequate quality, analyzes each scan using “Discovery” software and transmits all bone density data to the DCC.   The data provided by this longitudinal study will be used to build a greatly needed reference database that may be used in the future to identify children at risk for developing osteoporosis as adults.  The subcontractor will  continue the study stated above for the purpose of obtaining an additional three annual data pointsyears on the same 1,554 children. This will provide important data information needed on bone acquisition in the late teenage years and into the early twenties. C-TASC is now soliciting proposals from qualified offerors to serve as  the Radiographic Core Laboratory. Specifically, the successful subcontractor will possess hologic software used for DXA acquisition and analysis.  Core Laboratory staff shall possess strong scientific qualifications and experience relating to multicenter quality control and interpretation of bone density measurements in children. The subcontractor is expected to have experience with the use of a pediatric quality control phantom. Additionally, the subcontractor should provide details on their expertise in pQCT QA and analysis.  The Radiographic Core Laboratory shall work with the five established Clinical Centers to perform the following tasks:  (1) Adhere to established standardized methods used to obtain DXA scans across all five Clinical Centers; (2) Provide standardized methods for daily calibration of densitometers at the Clinical Centers and for cross-calibration of densitometers at all Clinical Centers on a regular basis; (3) Provide a plan for machine maintenance and how to address issues related to machine breakdowns at the Clinical Centers; (4) Adhere to an established system of data logging and initial validation of quality of scans in a timely fashion; (5) Communicate with Clinical Centers in cases of file transfer problems, incomplete data, etc.; (6) Interpret all DXA scans for bone and, where appropriate, soft tissue; (7) Create/maintain database of all analyzed parameters; (8) Transmit reports of scans to the DCC; (9) Circulate a pediatric phantom among the five Clinical Centers.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), and the C-TASC is not committed to award a subcontract pursuant to this announcement.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about January 27, 2006, on the FedBizOpps website (http://www.fedbizopps.com).  This competition is designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541710.  All inquiries concerning the subcontracting opportunity, Ref. #C-TASC-2006-00, shall be directed to Virginia Milne, Administrator, C-TASC, Phone (410) 464-4187, Fax (410) 433-6751, E-mail vmilne@c-tasc.com.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Imaging Program (CIP), plans to procure on a sole source basis, service maintenance of the ClinArc, PACS hardware maintenance, and Cedara Licenses from Imaging Archive International LLC., 5966 Exeter Circle, Norcross, Georgia 30071.   The supplies and services are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 and the business size standard is $6M.  The NCI, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) procured a ClinArc system with Cedara software from Imaging Archive International, LLC (IAI) in 2004. IAI ClinArc is the archive system that serves as the back bone for the CIP PACS system through the NCI Center for Bio-Informatics. The experience of IAI networking their ClinArc data archive management system with Cedara is critical for assuring the successful implementation and full functionality of these two products in the CIP PACS system. CIP has verified the functionality of this combined configuration of the ClinArc archive system and Cedara software and the performance of IAI using the Cedara product during the past twelve months. The Cedara software is a crucial part of the integrated image archive and display system that allows us to download, visualize, manipulate, and return images to the archive system (ClinArc) using the open source architecture and the DICOM standard for image formats which is unique to both the ClinArc Archive and Cedara image display/viewing software.  The procurement of the support and licenses is an extension of the service that Imaging Archive International (IAI) has been providing over the past year for an essentially combined proprietary image archive system (hardware and software [Cedara]).   Image Archive International (IAI) is one of the leading PACS archive vendors for open architecture that provides the infrastructure for “best of breed” systems.  For diagnostic workstation display software IAI has partnered with Cedara. While Cedara is a widely distributed and well-known display software platform for diagnostic PACS workstations, it is not sold directly but only provided through third parties such as IAI. The Cedara product was designed in close cooperation with clinical imagers to provide optimum viewing and work flow functionality. To this end, Cedara has developed and implemented unique functions with the Image Archive International (IAI) ClinArc archive system including bi-directional communication of such features as read status, etc. The experience of IAI networking their ClinArc data archive management system with Cedara is critical for assuring the successful implementation and full functionality of these two products in the CIP PACS system. CIP has verified the functionality of this configuration and the performance of IAI using the Cedara product over the last twelve months.  Imaging Archive International is the only source known that can provide the unique functions developed through the on-going collaboration between IAI ClinArc and Cedara, it cannot be provided by another third party vendor.  IAI was the originator of the system and is the only company that can maintain it appropriately.   This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:00 PM EST, January 24, 2006.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist, at gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NCI-60027-NE.

<DESC>The INL/A single engine eradication aircraft perform a variety of missions.  At times the aircraft operate from forward operating base locations under primitive conditions and at other times from international airports with instrument only approaches.  The primary mission is to locate and eradicate illicit narcotic producing plants.  This mission requires that the aircraft have (relative to standard production agricultural spray aircraft) exceptional range and endurance, as well as the capability to fly aerial application operations at altitudes up to 12,000 feet MSL.  Operations are often flown in very rugged mountainous terrain that requires optimum climb and turn performance at high-density altitudes.  Illicit crops are usually grown in remote areas with few bases from which to operate aircraft.  For this reason, the aircraft is required to have much greater range than standard agricultural spray aircraft.   Reconnaissance missions flown by this airframe are in the same rugged environment as the aerial eradication, but generally require even greater endurance to cover large areas of remote territory.  Further, the aircraft and crews are frequently targeted by hostile fire.  Most hits received have been from NATO ball 7.62mm (sometimes steel core armor piercing) and smaller arms.  A swath guidance system is currently installed on the fleet and is used primarily as a spray guidance system and a spray area organizational tool, but also has a secondary function as a mission recorder providing a vital database for spray analysis and mission evaluation.

INL/A is soliciting industry comments on the draft solicitation for the procurement of additional aerial eradication aircraft. Written comments may be sent to Mr. Patrick Murphy at murphypj@state.gov.  Comments are due on or before 17 Jan 06.

GN2 is FOB origin from the contractor’s facility. The resultant contract will be a five-year, fixed price requirements-type contract.  The contract ordering period will be from 1 May 2006 through 30 Apr 2011. The estimated yearly GN2 Pipeline requirements are 350,000 MC (Thousand Cubic Feet) for the first year; 400,000 MC for the second year; 350,000 MC for the third year; 300,000 MC for the fourth year; and 300,000 MC for the fifth year. The estimated yearly quantities for GN2 product for the tube bank trailers are 3,000 MC for the first year; 3,500 MC for the second year; 3,000 MC for the third year; 2,750 MC for the fourth year; and 2,750 MC for the fifth year.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking to identify sources that can provide clinical assessment software to support the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR), which is both a database and a set of tools for autism researchers – a national resource for collaboration in autism research and clinical practice.  This RFI is being issued by the Office of Acquisitions Management, National Library of Medicine (NLM), NIH, which provides acquisition support services to CIT.

NDAR will support clinical and translational research within the autism research community and will build on existing work within the autism community and in related research domains.  Its goal is to shorten the time of discovery of causes and treatments for autism by giving researchers access to more data than they can collect on their own. 

 

NDAR will include: 

·        a database that will give researchers access to relevant data, seamlessly, from federated (linked) databases 

·        a data-entry function for researchers 

·        tools to collect, analyze, and publish research data

 

Some researchers will utilize NDAR to access data, some will utilize NDAR to contribute data, and some researchers will both contribute and access shared data through NDAR.

NIH is interested in investigating the availability of both COTS and open source software tools that can be installed at NIH sites and non-NIH sites that would support and/or access the NDAR database.  NIH is NOT seeking responses from service providers or for ASP solutions.

 

In order to identify sources that can provide clinical assessment software to support the NDAR database, NIH seeks information on available technologies, specifically software tools for data management of behavioral, clinical and medical data from clinical studies.  This includes both standardized and non-standardized psychological/psychiatric interviews, direct observation assessments, physical/neurological exam data, medical/family history, and clinical assessments.  These tools are typically a component of a Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS).  For the purpose of this RFI, the NIH defines the scope of this technical domain as “clinical assessments”.  NIH has identified a preliminary set of NDAR database software features that it has categorized in descending order of importance as (1) required (mandatory), (2) highly desirable, and (3) desirable.  Interested sources choosing to respond to this RFI must complete and submit the Table of Software Features that can be downloaded under this announcement.  For each software feature listed in the Table, the respondent must check if the feature is currently (1) in production, (2) in development (available within 6 months), or (3) is a future feature.  Paper copies of the Table will NOT be issued.

 

The information gathered through this market research, combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies, will assist NIH in its preparation of specifications for any future solicitation for the acquisition of clinical assessment software for the NDAR database.

 

This Sources Sought/RFI is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be constructed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.

<SUBJECT>99--Development of a TDWR Target Simulation System
<SOLNBR>4545
<RESPDATE>022206
<CONTACT>Phyllis Townsley, 405-954-7816
<DESC>MARKET SURVEY REVISED 1/10/06 TO REMOVE THE WORD "FIGURE" FROM "NOISE FIGURE" ON ITEM NUMBER 8 AS THIS TECHNICALLY HAS A DIFFERENT MEANING. The FAA has a requirement for a Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) Target Simulation System.  The intent of this market survey is to initiate industry involvement, develop and refine the procurement strategy, obtain price information, determine whether commercial items exist, determine the level of competition, identify market practices, and obtain comments on requirements. TDWR Background: The TDWR is a C-Band weather radar that puts runway specific weather products on an air traffic controller's situation displays, such as: windshear alerts, microburst alerts, gust fronts and heavy precipitation.  It is a 3-D radar with 0.5 degree beam width that processes range cells (range gates) of 150 meters.  Unlike point target detection, the TDWR must be optimized for weather targets so the receiver, signal processor and radar computer always generate scientifically reproducible weather products. Some TDWR Operating Parameters:  1.	Frequency: C-Band 5600 MHz to 5650 MHz  2.	Pulse modulated signal with a pulse width of 1 microsecond and rise/fall time 110-200 nanoseconds.  3.	PRF of 325 Hz to 2000 Hz that varies in a 6 minute volume scan of the radar.  4.	The radar return waveform has a lower level typically -120 dBm.  5.	The radar completes one volume scan in 6 minutes.  We would like to save 5-6 volume scans of waveform data.  6.	There are 23 "tilts" (i.e. Twenty three 360-degree tilts) during a volume scan. Each tilt varies in time, but the fastest is 12 seconds .  7.	Each tilt varies in time, but all are completed in one 6 minute volume scan.  8.	The noise of the radar return waveform is reduced by approximately 70 dB using a band pass filter outside the 10 MHz window. TDWR Receiver Specifications: 1.	Frequency Range:  5600 MHz to 5650 MHz (However, only a single frequency is used, receiver input is filtered to only accept 5 MHz around this single frequency for a 10MHz pass band.) 2.	Bandwidth:  910 kHz at 3 dB 3.	C-Band LO:  5630 MHz to 5680 MHz 4.	IF:  30 MHz 5.	System Clock:  10 MHz 6.	Image Rejection:  >50 dB at downconverter input 7.	Dynamic Range:  127.5 dB (total) 101.5 dB (instantaneous) 8.	Sensitivity Time Control:  26 dB 9.	Automatic Gain Control:  42 dB 10.	Receiver Sensitivity:  -110.8 dBm 11.	Pulse Width:  1.0 us +/- 0.1 us 12.	Pulse Repetition Frequency:  326.2 Hz to 1930.5 Hz 13.	Range Sample:  150 m 14.	Azimuth Sample:  1 deg 15.	Stability:  -60.7 dBc System Requirements: There is a need to develop a TDWR target simulation system that can capture the radar return waveform from a 10 dB directional coupler before the signal enters the receiver downconverter and to save the waveform on a hard drive.   The length of time to capture is 25-30 minutes and the FAA would like to manipulate the waveform using various software tools.  While capturing the waveform, there is a need to trigger the capturing tool for external analog interrupts and place markers in time for them. Once the waveform data has been saved, the FAA would like to playback the waveform (pump the RF signal) through the radar receiver that is cued by the recorded interrupt markers and by matching external analog interrupts.  This means the waveform will be played back when it receives an external cue that matches the recorded marker.  This will enable the FAA to truth test our radar receiver and signal processor to determine the changes made to it.  The goal is to get repeatable targets on the radar situation display with the saved waveforms.   The return waveform has a 10 MHz span at C-Band frequency and it would be ideal to save this waveform in a 32-bit word format. There are two analog interrupts that must be captured and played back. The first is the Antenna Control Pulse (ACP).  There is 1 ACP per 0.05 degrees of antenna motion. This results in 7200 ACPs per tilt. The other analog interrupt is the Antenna Reference Pulse (ARP) indicating the end of a tilt. Therefore, there are 23 ARPs in a volume scan.  Total analog interrupts needed in one 6-minute volume scan: 165,600 + 23 = 165,623. Attached for reference are three drawings that contain: TDWR Receiver Exciter (REX) block diagram, the exciter unit of the REX and receiver portion of the REX.  Interested vendors that may have capabilities to develop a TDWR target simulation system should respond with their proposed documentation (2 copies) to demonstrate their ability to the Contracting Officer.  Responses are due March 1, 2006.  The documentation must clearly demonstrate the ability to capture radar return data that is between the frequencies of 5600 MHz and 5650 MHz, and play it back through a radar receiver. If radar data captured is less than 25 minutes, then the playback system should be able to "stitch" together pieces of data that are at least 5 minutes of recording.  Questions may be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer.  Facsimile responses are not permitted.   The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this announcement.  Any information received as a result of this market survey will not be for use outside the Government but solely for the purpose of determining whether sources exist for this requirement.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable.  This market survey shall not be construed as a request for proposal or an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Responders to this market survey may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.

<CONTACT>John Manouelian, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 435-3813, Fax (301) 402-6699, Email jm486p@nih.gov
<DESC>The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) has a continuing requirement for a Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU).  Beginning in September 1999, the NCI created via contract the CTSU; the intent was to facilitate access by investigators to a broader menu of clinical trials led by Cooperative Groups or other investigators and to centralize and make more efficient a number of administrative tasks common to all the Cooperative Group Operations and Statistical/Data Management Centers.  The CTSU has, in fact, facilitated the conduct of trials by allowing a participating physician to perform registration and data management of patients on the trials of all Groups irrespective of the Group in which he/she is a member.  To further facilitate these cross-Group enrollments, the CTSU developed auditing, financial payment, and education/training systems that complement and interdigitate with the existing Cooperative Group systems.  In addition to Group members, the CTSU has also provided a mechanism for unaffiliated sites to participate in trials on the CTSU menu.

The CTSU systems are primarily web-based (www.ctsu.org) and there is a public and private website.  Only registered investigators have access to the private site where they can access materials and tools for enrolling patients on clinical trials. Presently the CTSU menu of over 60 trials consists primarily of phase 3 treatment trials in breast, lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, head and neck, hematologic and other less common tumors.  In addition, a more limited menu of phase 2 multi-center treatment trials is also available.  Investigators who are members of a Cooperative Group automatically have access to all CTSU trials, and some sites unaffiliated with Groups, have also been granted access, after undergoing a credentialing and review process conducted by the CTSU.

The purpose of this acquisition is to build upon the progress made over the last 6 years and expand the CTSU’s primary tasks, which include:  1) Operation of the CTSU comprehensive system for clinical trials management with state-of-the-art, web-based, registration, randomization and data collection/query systems; 2) Operation of the CTSU Regulatory Support System (RSS) to consolidate IRB approvals along with site and investigator credentialing for all Adult Group trials, phases 1-3; 3) Operation of the CTSU web site for accessing protocols, forms, and education/training materials; 4) Conduct education and training (generic and study-specific) for the CTSU systems and its menu of protocols; 5) Operation of the CTSU quality assurance system, including on-site auditing and real-time monitoring of data collection delinquencies and errors; 6) Operation of the CTSU financial management system for distribution of per case payments, leadership funds, investigator travel and technical expertise reimbursements; and 7) Operation of the CICRS (Clinical Independent Cancer Research Sites) program to permit unaffiliated sites to join the CTSU.

This is a recompetition of a previous requirement and the Government anticipates that one (1) contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a base period of three years with the opportunity for the contractor to earn up to four additional contract years (Award Terms).  RFP No. N02-CM-67001-48 will be issued on or about January 10, 2006.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Office of Acquisitions (OA), NCI, at the following url:  http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/ .  The NAICS Code is 541690.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  No Collect Calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is competing a new contract for support services for interdisciplinary studies in clinical cancer genetics targeting families with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, a model for familial cancer. The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of family studies and field (case-control and cohort) studies. Although the scientific design and oversight of the activities are the responsibility of the Clinical Genetics Branch professional staff, the major activities of the contract provide:  1) nursing support including contacting family members, explaining the studies, enrolling family members, obtaining clinical information and records, requesting pathology slides for diagnosis confirmation, arranging for family members to be evaluated by CGB investigators in the Cancer Genetics Clinic at the NIH Clinical Center, performing phlebotomy, obtaining other biologic specimens as necessary, arranging and conducting field trips to evaluate family members, verifying information for the family registry database, maintaining tracking systems for data and biologic specimens, developing and providing educational materials for participants, and participating in genetic counseling and risk notification; 2) maintenance of a locked medical record room to which CGB investigators have immediate access; 3) development of coordination and liaison at a local or international level with collaborating investigators or institutions whose cooperation is needed for the conduct of a study; 4) assistance in the design and pilot testing of forms required for field investigations (e.g., questionnaires, abstracting forms, coding forms, manuals for field procedures and other documents); 5) hiring, training and supervision of field personnel (interviewers, abstractors, and others); 6) identification of study subjects, including locating persons at risk of cancer and/or their relatives, selection of controls through such methods as random digit dialing and acquisition of appropriate study population rosters or files; 7) supervision and management of field operations; 8) collecting data (interviewing/record abstraction, biologic specimen collection and processing); 9) data reduction activities (coding, keying, and editing) of data collected into a format suitable for computer analysis; 10) quality control and standardization so that appropriate and valid data result.  The maintenance of a secure record room which allows CGB investigators access to the medical records within 15 minutes is a mandatory requirement. There is also a mandatory requirement of the capability of nearly daily face to face meetings with the CGB staff. It is anticipated that one incrementally funded, cost-reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded for a period of five years, with a required total level of effort of 53,000 direct labor hours. It is anticipated that the Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be available on or about May 31, 2005 with responses due within 30 calendar days following the actual date of issuance of the RFP. The RFP may be accessed via the NCI Research Contract Branch (RCB) website: http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/ under “Current Requests for Proposals”. Award of this project is anticipated by January 17, 2005. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the NCI.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This Market Survey/Sources Sought notice is amended to clarify that this is  NOT a developmental contract.  This is a production contract.  The design is  finalized for this requirement, so the market survey has been redrafted to  read as follows: The U.S. Army, ARDEC at Picatinny Arsenal, N.J. is conducting a market survey  to identify sources that are capable of manufacturing a lightweight composite  cylindrical container via compression molding.  The container is used for  storing and transporting a single 120mm mortar cartridge.  The container is  made out of Quantum QC-8800 composite material capable of withstanding storage  and transportation scenarios within a temperature range of -65 deg F to +160  deg F. The container contains two pieces, a tube and cap held securely by a  latching mechanism that allows quick access to the cartridge. Fitting of the  cap on the tube provides the ability to maintain a 3PSIG seal throughout the  use of the container.  The weight of the container is approximately 7.6 lbs.  Potential candidates must possess the production line manufacturing tooling,  inspection fixtures, automated acceptance test equipment, technical knowledge  and expertise required to fulfill this requirement within a delivery timeframe  which is expected to be 15 months after contract award.  All responding  sources shall provide a summary of their company's capabilities including  organizations, name/address/point of contact identification, a description of  facilities/equipment, manufacturing process, inspection capability, personnel,  past experience, proven monthly production capacity, possible  partnering/teaming arrangements; and whether the company is a small or large  business.  The market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be  construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the  government.  The Government will utilize the information provided for planning  purposes only.  All information submitted will be provided at no cost to the  government and will be held in a confidential status.  The contractor shall  provide all information requested in this notification within fifteen days of  this publication by electronic mail to mgomez@pica.army.mil

Detailed questions on format and minor  issues are not the purpose of the VID. Questions that address omissions  and significant issues or areas of confusion are desired.

Note: New buyer Theresa  Hay replaces Michelle Hendricks on all future correspondence. ************************************************************************ Update 30 Sep 2005 - Re-Send to Fed Biz Opps - Organizational Conflict of  Interest The Fed Business Opportunities site can not handle the  Description in excess of 24000 characters so the original Sources Sought  announcement of 17 May has been saved as a WORD file and loaded to the  XR-SIMAF PIXS library below as  "ORIGINAL_SOURCES_SOUGHT_ANNOUNCEMENT_17MAY05". NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new  attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort.  ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has  been added to the library (scroll below). Questions were received during  one on one interview sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update: Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and  current contractors working in SIMAF. A request was also received for  contact information of companies participating in Industry Days. Both have  been added to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions  received during Industry Day and anticipate posting answers by 6 July  2005.  ************************************************************* Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14  Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS library. ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun  05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the  submittal of the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday  June 17th will be extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions  were asked about the SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following  infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple  Functions QUESTION: Because the standard business practices, company past  performance and responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR  requirements/restrictions will be the same for all functional areas, would  it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a cover letter with separate  attachments; one containing the common company data and then attachments  that address each functional area separately? ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is  providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions being proposed may be  grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a package. Common  or repeated information may be referred to from another function area SOC,  however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will  be acceptable, however. Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one  page cover page that may contain business information and details like  business size and CAGE code, etc. The cover page does not count towards  the 5 pages per function. Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be  acceptable to submit the SOC via email? ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is  acceptable. Please allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low  band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC submittals to Patricia  Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO will confirm receipt  of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14  June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to industry via  PIXS, or via a CD and when? ANSWER: The 14 June Industry Day briefings  will be loaded to PIXS and will available for download by COB 15 Jun 05.  ******************************************************************************Update: Posting of Improved Labor-Hour Estimate -- 7 June 2005 Thefollowing sentences have been modified in the following synopsis toreflect an improved estimate of labor hours for this effort: FROM...

<DESC>This invention covers a way to use nuclear or other power sources to displace the use of natural gas in producing ammonia and ammonium fertilizers. Avoiding the use of natural gas eliminates unpredictable large swings in feedstock prices and has the future benefit of not discharging carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Not requiring a nearby natural gas pipeline would allow these plants to locate near their primary customers in farming areas. 
Contact Mr. David Anderson.  A potential licensing opportunity exists with BEA, the prime operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL).

<DESC>The Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking to identify sources that can provide clinical assessment software to support the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR), which is both a database and a set of tools for autism researchers – a national resource for collaboration in autism research and clinical practice.  This RFI is being issued by the Office of Acquisitions Management, National Library of Medicine (NLM), NIH, which provides acquisition support services to CIT.

NDAR will support clinical and translational research within the autism research community and will build on existing work within the autism community and in related research domains.  Its goal is to shorten the time of discovery of causes and treatments for autism by giving researchers access to more data than they can collect on their own. 

 

NDAR will include: 

·        a database that will give researchers access to relevant data, seamlessly, from federated (linked) databases 

·        a data-entry function for researchers 

·        tools to collect, analyze, and publish research data

 

Some researchers will utilize NDAR to access data, some will utilize NDAR to contribute data, and some researchers will both contribute and access shared data through NDAR.

NIH is interested in investigating the availability of both COTS and open source software tools that can be installed at NIH sites and non-NIH sites that would support and/or access the NDAR database.  NIH is NOT seeking responses from service providers or for ASP solutions.

 

In order to identify sources that can provide clinical assessment software to support the NDAR database, NIH seeks information on available technologies, specifically software tools for data management of behavioral, clinical and medical data from clinical studies.  This includes both standardized and non-standardized psychological/psychiatric interviews, direct observation assessments, physical/neurological exam data, medical/family history, and clinical assessments.  These tools are typically a component of a Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS).  For the purpose of this RFI, the NIH defines the scope of this technical domain as “clinical assessments”.  NIH has identified a preliminary set of NDAR database software features that it has categorized in descending order of importance as (1) required (mandatory), (2) highly desirable, and (3) desirable.  Interested sources choosing to respond to this RFI must complete and submit the Table of Software Features that can be downloaded under this announcement.  For each software feature listed in the Table, the respondent must check if the feature is currently (1) in production, (2) in development (available within 6 months), or (3) is a future feature.  Paper copies of the Table will NOT be issued.

 

The information gathered through this market research, combined with information gathered through other research and analysis methodologies, will assist NIH in its preparation of specifications for any future solicitation for the acquisition of clinical assessment software for the NDAR database.

 

This Sources Sought/RFI is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be constructed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government may or may not solicit a requirement on the basis of responses, nor will it pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government’s use of such information.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.  Should a solicitation materialize as a result of this Sources Sought/RFI, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or the Government’s use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.  Respondents will be notified of the results of NIH’s review of the information received in response to this Sources Sought/RFI.  Any proprietary information submitted with any response to this RFI should be so marked and it will be kept confidential. 

Responses should be identified with NIH-CIT-SOURCES SOUGHT/RFI-06-056, and are welcome until February 20, 2006.  Please submit your response electronically to both John White, Center for Information Technology, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, at whitej@mail.nih.gov and Rico Batte, Contracting Officer, Office of Acquisitions Management, National Library of Medicine, at rb468p@nih.gov.

However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The procurement involves pumps and parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacture or its actual supplier, and others proposing to manufacture the parts must either: 1) Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufacturer; or 2) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e., salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics). The submission of technical data package for review shall not impede the award of this requirements type contract, but will qualify the proposer for follow on acquisitions of the specific part numbers offered.  It is the Government belief that only Gould Pump, Inc., the manufacture of the parts, or/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities in duplicate within 15 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing data is required.  This is not a RFP.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  Responses must be concise and specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above. Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capability should be sent to the attention of Patricia Dobbins at the address indicated above.  See Numbered Note 22*****

<SUBJECT>25 -- Real-Time Recognition of Automotive Driving Contexts
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, New Mexico) has developed technology to allow the recognition of physical driving contexts in real time.  This technology consists of a computational cognitive model of the mechanisms whereby humans apply their knowledge and experience to interpret and identify contexts that occur during the operation of a vehicle, such as entering a high-speed roadway or approaching a slow-moving vehicle.  This technology also consists of methods for automatically identifying driving contexts from unstructured and unlabeled vehicle and physiological data.  Furthermore, context classifiers can be automatically tailored to the driving style of new users.  In validation studies, this technology has shown itself to identify the correct driving context over 90% of the time, in both on-road and off-road conditions.

This technology has been used to identify driving situations that were predetermined to be potentially dangerous.  Also, this technology has been used to identify those situations that cause driving situations to become difficult.  In the former case, a human provides exemplars of the potentially dangerous situations and the system learns to identify similar situations based on those exemplars.  In the latter case, the system automatically determines the important situations from the driving data, and the human then indicates which situations are difficult.  This is useful when it is not clear which driving contexts are important to identify in advance.  Since this approach automatically determines contexts directly from data, the system can determine how the driving style of a particular user differs from other users, and the system can tailor its response accordingly.  Both types of systems have shown themselves able to predict the human recognition of driving situations over 90% of the time.

Sandia is making this Real-Time Recognition of Automotive Driving Contexts technology available to companies interested in partnering with Sandia to develop near-term and/or future applications via licensing or cooperative development agreements.  Sandia will consider negotiating up to and including exclusive field of use licensing when business conditions are appropriate.

<SUBJECT>FORCEnet TECHNICAL DIRECTOR PLANNING AND ANALYSIS
<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSYCEN), San Diego intends to solicit and award a Firm Fixed Price type, one year base with two one-year options, IDIQ contract to Kros-wise, Inc. (a Service-disabled Veteran Owned Small Business) at 5346 Grandridge Rd, El Cajon, CA 92020-7727 on a sole source basis.  Authority for Other-Than-Full and Open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(5) (FAR 6.302-5), authorized or required by statute, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, and FAR 19.1406(a), Sole Source Awards to Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Business Concerns. The contractor will provide technical, analytical and other support including strategic planning, analysis, process improvements, organizational development strategies, knowledge management, and comprehensive support for large FORCEnet Engineering conferences.  Strategy planning and analysis support will be provided in the development of documentation required to track the execution of technical and management process activities. Standard process methodologies will be used for analysis to ensure value-added improvements. Knowledge Management Tools will be evaluated and deployed for use in tracking Plan of Action and Milestones (POAM), tasking, calendaring and document storage and management. This effort will involve various multi-media support capabilities, especially web based solutions for surveys and collaborative workspaces. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Based on previous efforts performed for SSC SD and years of experience supporting the Navy enterprise, the government has determined that Kros-wise is the only concern that can perform the services with the rapid and efficient manner required by the Government.  Kros-wise has developed and maintained web-based IT collaboration tools used by SPAWAR to support FORCEnet Alignment across the SPAWAR enterprise and the FORCEnet Engineering Conference Planning and development.   These tools, FnAlign Repository, FORCEnet Engineering Conference Planning Portal, and Web-based surveys provide the digital environment to enable the automation of the core processes required by this effort.  Kros-wise has specific knowledge and experience with digital tools including PMToolbox, eRoom, TopVue and Oracle Collaboration Suite which are being used or considered for potential employment by the FORCEnet Alignment Caucus. This included the development and use of the aforementioned FORCEnet Engineering Conference Planning web tool and all related visualizations, links, and applications. Reuse of this tool will expedite planning and allow same user interface.  The use of any other source for this acquisition would result in the duplication of cost and time to develop the technical capability within another contractor's workforce, which would result in substantial added cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330; the size standard is $21 Million. The anticipated award date is 31 March 2006, with a total estimated value of less than $2.3 Million dollars including options. Questions concerning this sole source contract action may be directed to John McIvers, at john.mcivers@navy.mil. See numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>A--ESMD ROBOTIC LUNAR EXPLORATION PROGRAM SECONDARY PAYLOAD RFI
<DESC>ESMD ROBOTIC LUNAR EXPLORATION PROGRAM SECONDARY PAYLOAD REQUEST FOR INFORMATION The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) has an opportunity to include a small secondary payload with the launch of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) scheduled for October 2008.  NASA will solicit proposals internally from the NASA field centers for existing or reasonably matured concepts that offer a cost-effective contribution to the Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP).  If an internal proposal demonstrates a concept beneficial to RLEP, then NASA may select it for further development and eventual launch.   The NASA internal selection is scheduled to occur in February 2006. While NASA will serve as the prime entity for these internally-developed proposals, NASA is encouraging teaming between the field centers and industry.	This Request for Information is intended to allow interested industry respondents to supply secondary payload concepts consistent with the instructions provided below.  All concepts, as received by the RLEP Program Office, will be made available to the NASA field centers prior to their proposal due date.  Each center, upon reviewing the concepts, will determine if it is competitive value to develop a teaming arrangement with individual respondents.  NASA is not planning any acquisition as a result of this RFI.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  The successful NASA field center is responsible for determining and conducting any procurement action(s) relating to its individual concept proposal. The instructions to be given to the NASA field centers to guide their proposal preparation include the following: 1.  The concept must advance the Vision for Space Exploration.     a.	Missions that advance lunar science by providing data or knowledge.     b.	Missions that characterize the lunar environment.     c.	Missions that support identification of sites for future human missions as well as the potential utility of those sites.     d.	Missions that test or demonstrate technology that could enhance future exploration.     e.	Missions that demonstrate operational concepts in support of exploration activities.     f.	Missions that develop or emplace infrastructure in support of exploration activities.     g.	Missions that advance commercial opportunities—either in terms of incentivizing new commercial approaches to doing NASA’s business or by developing long-term commercial opportunities at the Moon.     h.	Missions that collect engineering data to support development activities of the Constellation elements. 2.  The concept must be affordable.  NASA is seeking mission candidates with total costs in the $50 million range.  Lower cost missions will be more attractive than higher cost ones.  NASA will consider missions with total costs above $50M, but such missions must demonstrate extraordinarily increased benefit for the additional expense.  In no case will NASA consider missions with a total cost exceeding $80 million. 3.  The mission cost estimate must be credible.  Cost estimates must be validated through methods to include (but are not limited to) reconciliation with accepted cost estimation models, analogy to similar systems, or extensive heritage and evidence that the heritage is extensible to the instant mission.   4.  The schedule estimate must be credible.  NASA will expect analyses analogous to those useful for validating cost in order to validate schedule estimates. 5.  The total secondary payload mass at launch must not exceed 1000 kg, including any required payload adapter. 6.  Given schedule and cost constraints, NASA encourages concepts that have history and heritage.  While this is not a limitation, concepts that leverage existing hardware, have high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) components or that are well studied and documented will be more attractive than concepts that do not. Industry respondents' payload concepts are due, via email, to rlep2nd@nx.arc.nasa.gov, no later than 5pm EST, Wednesday, January 25, 2006.  Submissions may be in any format, but should be no more than 10 pages in length, including figures.  Submissions must also be less than 7 Mbytes in file size.  Please do not submit any proprietary information you do not wish all NASA field centers to view.  Questions about this Request for Information should be directed to: Dr. Butler Hine, RLEP Deputy Program Manager, at Butler.P.Hine@nasa.gov.

1.	Acceptability.  To be considered for award, a vendor must agree to, and conform to, all the terms and conditions of the solicitation.  If a quote is not initially acceptable, it may be removed from consideration, and the other evaluation factors not evaluated. Acceptability will be scored on a “pass/fail” basis.

2.	Suitability.  Suitability encompasses all factors that contribute to the conference attendee's comfort and safety and to the overall success of the conference held at the hotel.  Evaluation of suitability will be a subjective assessment of the features offered by the hotel. 

The suitability assessment will focus on, but not be limited to, the condition of the hotel facility (new, old, remodeled); condition of the guest rooms (designated non-smoking rooms; soft goods clean and in good condition, etc.); condition of the meeting rooms (size and shape, obstructions such as pillars, soundproofing, security, proximity of rooms to each other, etc.); hotel services; availability of on-premise outlets, such as restaurants, convenience store and fitness facility; accessibility to airport; characteristics of the neighborhood in which the hotel is located.  

The NIH may base its rating of these features solely on the information provided in each quote and/or, at NIH’s option, on the findings gathered during a SITE VISIT.  Suitability is a scored evaluation factor.

3.	Past Performance.   Past performance is considered to be the hotel’s relevant work history and the NIH's assessment, with respect to such work history, of how well the hotel performed.  Especially relevant are a hotel's record of conforming to contract requirements; a hotel's commitment to customer satisfaction; and, generally, a hotel's reputation for demonstrating a business-like concern for the interests of its customers. 

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on NIH’s experience, if any, with the hotel; the experience of references with the hotel; and a consideration of other relevant facts and circumstances that are obtained by NIH from any source.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.   Past performance will be given a verbal rating – Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor.
4.	Price.  Price is the total evaluated cost of a quotation.  NIH will base total evaluated cost on the prices quoted for all CLINs listed in Part I.  The total evaluated cost will be based on the “estimated maximum” quantities shown for each CLIN multiplied by the unit prices quoted.  NIH will not consider prices that are contingent, unreasonable or unbalanced.  Price is not a scored evaluation factor.  NIH will use total evaluated cost as part of its best value analysis.
5.	Technical Requirements

6.	The Summary of Deviations and Exceptions

Description

TITLE:  Trawl-resistant acoustic doppler current profiler platform with gimbal

General Description of Requirements

The United Stated Environmental Protection Agency’s National Health and Environmental Effect Research Laboratory – Gulf Ecology Division is engaged research projects in Gulf of Mexico estuaries and on the continental shelf of the Gulf of Mexico which require deployment of an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) on the seafloor.   The instrument to be deployed is an RDI Instruments, Inc. Workhorse Monitor ADCP equipped with an external battery back.  A gimbal is needed to ensure that the ADCP will be pointed directly upward.  We plan to deploy at times and locations that will minimize exposure to trawling, but moderate trawling resistance is needed.  The ADCP platform will be deployed from small vessels (e.g., 25' outboard), and therefore its weight in air must be low enough to be handled by several people.  It may be lowered and retrieved by a lifting harness, or deployed by divers.

Specifications
The ADCP platform shall:
•	accommodate and securely mount an RSI Instruments, Inc. Workhorse Monitor ADCP and accompanying RDI Instruments external battery pack.
•	be equipped with a 2-axis gimbal to ensure vertical orientation of the ADCP.
•	have a shape and dimension that ensures the platform is stable on soft-sediments in potentially strong tidal currents.
•	have a shape, dimension and level of strength that affords moderate trawl-over resistance. 
•	have a closed or grated bottom to facilitate in deployment on very soft bottoms.
•	shall weigh less than 150 pounds in air, but may include removable ballast that, when installed, would increase the weight in air.
•	weigh at least 100 pounds when deployed in the water (including ballast, if included).
•	be constructed of marine-grade materials resistant to corrosion in a warm-, salt-water environment.
•	not include ferrous metal components that would interfere with the internal compass of an ADCP.

The following provisions apply:

52.212-1 -  Instruction to Offerors – Commercial –
52.212-2  - Evaluation of Commercial items
                   The evaluation for this procurement will be based on technical, price and past 
	        performance.
52.212-3  - Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items (offer must 
                   include a completed copy of this provision.)
The following clause applies:
52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items

For copies of the provisions, clauses or standard form 18, please contact the Contracting Officer listed below.  The closing date for this is procurement is January 25, 2006at 10:00 a.m. EST For additional information: Bernice McCorvey, (850) 934-9225, Fax (850) 934-2400.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Background:  This program will explore promising technologies and concepts in support of the command's mission to our nation's Defense Strategy and identified customer needs.   It will identify emerging technologies that could support the command's distrib ution and transportation systems through a process, which prioritizes those needs for funding while exploring, leveraging, and shaping government, commercial & academic community efforts to provide global mobility support, integrated transportation deploym ent solutions and connection of its customers to the high-tech, high-speed global market place.  This program will complement established DOD and USTRANSCOM processes involving basic research, applied research, and technology transfer vehicles such as Adva nced Concept Technology demonstrations (ACTDs) and Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs).  -  Deliverables will be a process for the command to identify and resolve technology gaps in the execution of our mission (materiel, hardware, and software).  The process will identify our technology and capability gaps and adjudicate the spectrum of possi bilities and determine feasible solutions.   -  The framework will provide a concise identification of the technologies to be explored / developed, the Defense Transportation System (DTS) or Distribution Process Owner (DPO) systems with which they will be integrated, and expected results of the work.  Specifically id entifying the user of the technology, a description of how the technology can enhance the existing systems and / or concepts of operation, and describe potential for return on investment (personnel, time, funding) to the user.   -  USTRANSCOM Instruction 61-1 establishes policy and procedures necessary to develop, implement, and manage the USTRANSCOM S&T Program. SDDCTEA is designated as the command's lead to the Executive Oversight Group (EOG) and Management Team, which will ensu re the development of a fiscally responsible, executable S&T plan for USTRANSCOM and its components.   The S&T EOG and Management Team will recommend and promote command efforts for projects that have merit, appear technically feasible, and include a trans ition / acquisition strategy, as required by DOD regulations, in order to minimize program risk. -  This program will provide a structured approach to providing input into TRANSCOM's R&D Program.
