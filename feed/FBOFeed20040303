<DESC>The US Army Research Development Engineering Command Simulation Technology Training Center (RDECOM-STTC), in conjunction with the U. S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) and the Army Research Institute for Behavioral and Social Sciences  (ARI), through the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division  (NAVAIR-Orlando TSD) issued Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), N61339-01-R-0023 in the CBD on 1 March 2001.  The purpose of this notice is a call for technical and cost proposals.  The US Army Research Development Engineering Command Simulation Technology Training Center (RDECOM-STTC), 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3276 calls for technical and cost proposals to be submitted in response to this announcement that address the goals for the research effort entitled, ìStand Alone Patient Simulatorî.   To facilitate this effort, RDECOM-STTC is soliciting full technical and cost proposals from qualified contractors in reference to the research effort entitled, ìStand Alone Patient Simulator.î   THE RESEARCH GOALS FOR STAND ALONE PATIENT SIMULATORS are the result of several discussions between RDECOM, MRMC, and the trainers at AMEDD C&S.  The research goals detailed below are a compilation of the needs expressed by the user community and comprise the primary research topic for mannequin based patient simulator technology under BAA N61339-01-R-0023; Paragraph 1-K entitled ìMedical Modeling and Simulation.î

The goals stated below are not hard requirements and we realize that no vendor can address them all, especially in the first year.  Those that can be addressed should be addressed and research should be considered on the remaining items. 

PRIMARY ATTRIBUTES:  Stand Alone.  The simulator should be free of external racks, equipment, gas bottles, or network connections.  A single power connection is allowable;  Power.  The simulator should be capable of operating for at least 30 minutes without being plugged in.  Longer run times are desirable. The simulator should minimally be powered by 110v AC with additional power options desirable.  The concept of operation is for the simulator to be plugged in when power is available.  However, there is a need for the simulator to be disconnected from power and transported without disrupting the applied scenario;  Network.  The simulator should be capable of being controlled from either a central control station or from a local laptop or PDA via wireless networking technologies.  This network interface should be documented and should allow for external systems to input control data to the system.  Multiple simulators should be controllable from a single point; Clinically Accurate. The simulator should react automatically and clinically accurately to changes in its physiologic condition.  The capability should exist to introduce a complication without interrupting the scenario.  (i.e. a spontaneous pneumothorax);  There is a hard STO requirement for these simulators to cost less than $30,000 a copy.  PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES:  Weight.  The weight of the simulator should approximate the weight of a similar sized human.  Weight distribution should also be similar to that of a human.  The STO requirement is between 75% and 110% of the weight of a similar sized human.  Flexibility.  The simulator should bend in the same places a human bends, and it should be possible to carry it in a firemanís carry position;  Must be rugged enough to survive training in the field.  MEDICAL ATTRIBUTES:  Airway.  The airway should be an accurate representation of the human anatomy. It should react in a clinically accurate way to improper airway management (i.e. jaw thrust and head tilt-chin lift).  The airway should also allow realistic training in the use of at least, but not limited to, the following airways:  Naso-Gastric tube  J-tube; Combi-tube; ET Tube; Laryngeal Mask Airway; Breathing.  Breathing should be realistic enough to gauge the rate and quality.  Breathing sounds should at a minimum allow the trainee to hear the following sounds bilateral x4: Clear; Rales; Wheezes; Stridor; Circulation.  Pulses should be tied to the patient condition and should react in a clinically accurate way to changes in heart rate, and blood pressure.  The pulses should be realistic enough to gauge the rate and quality.  Bleeding and Fluids.  Bleeding and fluid loss should be tied to patient condition so that excessive loss causes a clinically accurate reaction. The blood should be accessible so that individual moulaged injuries can be placed anywhere on the body.  Mucus and clear fluid secretions should be available from the eyes, nose, ears and mouth.  Eyes.  At a minimum the eyes should blink and allow for setting the pupil dilation to simulate head trauma and other conditions.   Sounds. Heart sounds should be realistic and clinically relevant to the scenario being run.  The simulator should mimic realistic speech and such speech is clear and understandable.  Medical Procedures.  At a minimum, the simulator should train the basic psychomotor skills required to perform the following procedures: Chest tube insertion; Needle decompression of a tension pneumothorax on both sides; Chrichothyroidotomy Sternal Interosseous Infusion device; IV insertion; Orthopedic Injuries.  The simulator should be capable of simulating orthopedic injuries to the legs and arms.  These conditions can be simulated with additional part.  It is desirable to simulate the look and feel of a flail chest.  Cervical Spine Immobilization.  The simulator should detect if the C-Spine immobilization has failed and should simulate a clinically accurate response in the patient.
Body Tremors.  Tremors are a desirable feature in certain scenarios; Drug Intervention.  Since most drugs on the battlefield are pre-measured, a complicated drug recognition system is not necessary.  There is, however, a need to recognize the introduction of the drug with a clinically accurate response.  Surrogate drug injection devices are desirable.  These surrogates should simulate the look, feel and function of the actual device.  At a minimum, the following drugs should be simulated: IV fluids; Morphine; Atropine; Epinephrine; HSD; 2PAM-chloride; Diazepam
Hemoglobin based oxygen carrier (HBOC) s; Realism.  Core research should be performed to increase the realism (look, feel, and smell) of the simulation.  The following areas should be evaluated for increasing the realism.
Traumatic injuries. Skin. Color change due to condition; Sweating; Chem/bio effects; Medical landmarks and underlying structure.  Surgical incisions. (chest tube); The listed research goals define the minimum training requirements that need to be met at the end of the project. 

PROPOSAL PREPARATION:  Detailed Technical and Cost Proposals are due NLT 3:00pm EST 19 Apr 2004.  No extensions will be granted.  No classified proposal will be accepted. Proposals submitted shall be in accordance with this notice and the more detailed information/requirements provided at http://www.peostri.army.mil/BAA/home.jsp. (See Part II of BAA N61339-01-R-0023).    Proposals that do not satisfy the following form and format requirements will be rejected without review and returned to the offeror.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Copies of the solicitation may be requested from the Peace Corps Point of Contact. The U.S. Peace Corps (PC) has a requirement to obtain a qualified independent, software development vendor to customize and implement an internet based application system that would allow users to fill out a Peace Corps Volunteer Application online and submit the information contained within the application electronically to the agency. The purpose of this online application system is to continue to fulfill the agencyís goal of providing Peace Corps applicants a high level of customer service and convenience, while also capturing and disseminating applicant data more efficiently and accurately. The Government will award a firm fixed- price Purchase Order (using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 13.5) resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforming to this solicitation is the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors
considered. Although price is substantially less important than the technical factors combined, it will not be ignored.

Tentatively, this requirement will be awarded as a single, firm fixed-price contract with a period of performance of a one (1) year base period, and four (4) one-year option periods. Currently, over 70 percent of all Peace Corps applications (and
over 75% of all Health Status Review (HSR) forms, which is part of the application) are completed online, but separately. In 2003, these numbers amounted to 8,333 applications and 12,491 HSRís that were completed through the use of the online application. In the past five years, the completion of Peace Corps applications online has become a major part of the Peace Corps business process. The contractor will ensure that there is no disruption in Peace Corpsí current ability to process online applications. The contractor shall survey and assess technology opportunities that will enhance Peace Corps application system performance and identify advance concepts that should be explored to meet emerging needs. While the Peace Corps will retain the use of its printed application for those applicants who do not have access to the internet, the agency seeks to continue the use of an online application form which provides the same functionality as the current application.  Peace Corps want to achieve the following goals: 1. Make the application process less expensive for the Peace Corps by saving time and the expense of printing and postage. Encourage more applicants to use the online application processes, by making it easier and more convenient than the paper process. 2. Further reduce the need for Peace Corps staff to manually enter the application data from paper applications. 3. Speed the receipt and dissemination of applicant information to Peace Corps headquarters and to Regional Recruiting Offices (RROís) across the country.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Egypt intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP), to implement the program described below. The new Financial Services Project (FSP) is designed to address five key economic problems in Egyptís financial sector: 1)absence of real estate financing institutions, 2)excessive reliance on seller finance from builders, 3)limited access to real estate backed credit, 4)lack of an adequate credit information system accessible to lenders, and 5)the narrow range of effective financial instruments to mobilize funds for investment. The goal of the FSP is to promote legal and procedural reforms that will allow banks and non-bank financial institutions to effectively use the most important types of ësecured lendingí ñ mortgages and other forms of secure collateral - that are the basis for the bulk of safe, low-cost lending within banking systems around the world. Interventions under the FSP will assist the Government of Egypt to address the following constraints: 1)underdevelopment of real estate finance institutions and limited real estate finance; 2)limited access to real estate finance and other collateralized finance by households and small business due in part to property not being properly registered or titled; 3)absence on credit information on potential borrowers, including their credit histories, to lower the cost of credit; and 4)the narrow range of efficient financial instruments to channel financial resources into domestic investments including real estate. 

The goals and purpose of the FSP will be achieved through four activities:  Activity 1: Technical assistance for the development of real estate finance channels including a sound legal framework, consistently applied credit underwriting procedures, access to long-term funding for real estate activities and support to financial institutions; Activity 2: Technical support for improving the legal and institutional process for collateralized financing which includes modernization of the system of registration of real property and introducing improved procedures for recording liens and repossessing collateral;  Activity 3: Support for an improved credit information system which will produce a state-of-the art low-cost collection, retrieval and management of information system; and Activity 4: Assistance with development of innovations in financial instruments which will seek to broaden the range of financial instruments that mobilize resources for productive investment. This RFP pertains specifically to all four activities of the FSP listed above. One direct contract will be awarded for implementation of these four activities. Information technology equipment will be procured as part of this project. Prospective offerors are encouraged to include qualified Egyptian sub-contractors.  Implementation under the contract will occur over four years with an option period of one year. The work conducted under the Contract awarded through this RFP will be integrated with implementation mechanisms for other activities under the Financial Sector Modernization Program.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541990. The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued. In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data error resulting from this transmission. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. No phone requests will be accepted, no solicitation will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed. Questions must be directed to Mr. Hani Takla, Sr. Contract Specialist, U.S. Agency for International Development, email: htakla@usaid.gov, fax no. (2-20)516-4739. We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a March 31, 2004. A pre-proposal conference will be held shortly thereafter, with specifics to be addressed in the RFP.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Jackson, Mississippi, New Construction, Design Phase, United States District Courthouse, Industry Day.

On Thursday, March 11, 2004, the United States General Services Administration (GSA) will conduct an Industry Day for prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants for the construction phase of a new United States District Courthouse.  The Industry Day will be conducted from 2:15 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in Room 501B of The McCoy Federal Building, 100 West Capitol Street, Jackson, Mississippi.

The facility to be constructed will be occupied by the U.S. District Court, U. S. Court of Appeals, U.S. Magistrate Court, U.S.Bankruptcy Court, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshal Service, Circuit Library, U.S. Probation Service, U.S. Trustee, Congressional Offices, and GSA.  The Estimated Total Project Cost (ETPC) is $88,000,000 and most perspective General Contractors (GC's) are expected to be represented.

The Industry Day is intended to affirm GSAís recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the firms that have expressed interest as the prospective GC's for this project.

Prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants will be given an opportunity to network with the prespective GC's to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors/consultants.  Elements of the RFP will also be addressed for the perspective GC's at 1:00 pm.  Because GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between Primes and Subcontractor/Consultants, any contracts that may develop between potential Primes and Subcontractors/Consultants as a result of the Industry Day will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Industry Day may be directed to either David Gibson, GSAís Small Business Outreach Specialist, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV; or Rebecca Vanover, GSAís Small Business Technical Advisor, Telephone (404) 331-3031, E-Mail Rebecca.Vanover@GSA.GOV.

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote E08210 and will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation that will be issued.  A written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-18.  The Food and Drug Administration, Office of the Commissioner, OER-IO intends to award a purchase order to use a public relations firm to develop and implement a plan for using the media to educate and inform FDAs constituents for the 2006 Centennial Commemoration.   Contract line items include the following: Item 1 ñ Develop a plan for commemorating the FDA centennial through broadcast and other media over a three year time span from 2004-2006 in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.1;  Item 2 - Develop the media project ideas and implementation ideas for constituents in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.2;  Item 3 -Define roles and responsibilities for implementation in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.3;   Item 4 - Use the media to achieve broad constituent recognition of the FDAís vital role in protecting and promoting the health and safety of the public in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.4.   

1.  Objective
 
On June 30, 2006, the Food and Drug Administration will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1906 Food and Drugs Act, legislation that established our nation's oldest federal consumer protection agency.  The agency wants to celebrate this historic milestone by promoting activities throughout the nation.  
 
In 2002, the agency contracted with a public relations firm to develop a theme and plan for commemorating FDA's 100th anniversary.  The theme is PROTECTING AND ADVANCING AMERICAíS HEALTH.  FDA envisions the implementation of a national public education program to recognize the scientific advances that have led to the safety and effectiveness of FDA regulated products.  As a result of this effort, the public consciousness of the FDA should be heightened so that both the consumer and policymakers see the agency as a pioneer and leader in the field of health protection and emerging scientific advances as we seek to recruit young scientists. 
 
The objective of this contract is to use a public relations firm to develop and implement, in the next year, a plan to use the media as the channel for educating and informing FDA's constituents over a three-year timeframe culminating with the 2006 centennial commemoration.   
 
2.  Goals
 The goals for the FDA Centennial are as follows:
 
Goal 1     Use broadcast and other media to observe and celebrate FDA's first 100 years of contributions to America's public health and the world community and further FDA's mission to promote and protect the public health for future generations.
 
Goal 2     Use broadcast and other media to commemorate contributions of dedicated FDA employees, legislators, academicians, industry, advocacy groups and public health leaders who have supported the consumer protection mission of the Agency.
 
Goal 3     Use broadcast and other media to broaden public awareness of the considerable breath of the FDA's authorities and programs and instill a fuller appreciation of the Agency's impact on the public health and safety of our Nation.
 
Goal 4     Use broadcast and other media to stimulate interest and increase awareness of FDA regulatory science and public health through education.

 
3.  Specific Tasks

3. 1. Develop a media plan and timetable for commemorating FDA's 100th anniversary of the 1906 
Food and Drugs Act.  The media messages will convey the importance of FDA in consumer's lives and how the FDA plays a role in 25 cents of every dollar consumers spend. 

The plan must be presented in writing. This plan will be reviewed through the FDA Office of External Relations and approved prior to implementation of the tasks specified in the contract.

3. 2. The plan should include specific activities to be carried-out throughout the three-year timetable culminating in the 2006 centennial year.  The plan must include all FDA centers and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (headquarters and field).  For example, a list of inventive elements such as televised town hall meetings, a Smithsonian lecture/exhibit/traveling exhibit, or the development of high school and college curriculum. 
Develop a strategy for extending FDA coverage through the media partnerships that will be mutually beneficial to the news organization and the FDA.  Partnerships may include, but is not limited to, business and industry, academia, consumer organizations, health professional associations, disease oriented advocacy groups, and faith-based and community-based programs.  Examples of activities may include  FDA information in regular programming, periodic special programming with commentary from the Commissioner or other senior FDA officials, and/or weekly specials to highlight FDA issues that affects its constituents, website recognition of FDA's centennial, exhibits at meetings, and development of educational modules for school use.
3.3.  Define the roles and responsibilities and the parts they will play throughout the three-years of celebration for the Commissioner, Center Directors, field staff and FDA Alumni Association members as well as involvement at the Department level and perhaps Cabinet level. 
3.4.   The media plan will need to communicate with all levels of FDAs constituents by translating complex themes to messages that are direct and easily understood.  These messages should speak to consumers about issues that affect their lives and offer strong visual and human interest components using real life examples whenever feasible.  The messages must cover a broad spectrum of constituents such as other governmental and public health entities, national institutions such as the Smithsonian Institute and the National Academy of Sciences, and media such as television (PBS), radio (NPR) and print (newspapers and magazines) to promote the centennial. 
As part of this effort, it will be important to have performance goals and measurements to be able to document the increase in constituent recognition and knowledge of FDA and its mission and accomplishments.

<DESC>Sources are sought to identify firms capable of providing management, technical expertise, supervision, tools, equipment, supplies, labor and quality control necessary to provide data evaluation support services to the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), Reactor Products Program (RPP).   AFTAC/RPP provides national authorities with quality data analysis and technical evaluations on nuclear treaty compliance. The anticipated contract requires proficiency in nuclear engineering/physics, statistics, atmospheric modeling/analysis, and computer software design and maintenance.  Nuclear expertise supports data collection, analysis, quality assurance, and evaluation requirements. Atmospheric modeling expertise supports operation and maintenance of a suite of government owned and commercial off-the-shelf atmospheric models. The majority of work is done off-site but some on-site support at Patrick AFB, FL will be required. Contractor presence in the local area is required to provide a responsive framework for adapting or modifying technologies to enhance mission effectiveness.

Nuclear data analysis begins with quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) throughout a radionuclide laboratory network. This includes checking data for trends and biases within and between laboratories and reporting findings via reports and meetings. The contractor will be required to employ industry accepted quality control techniques to analyze data from standard laboratory analysis of pay samples to include statistical analysis of mass spectrometry blind standards in order to provide an evaluation of laboratory performance and analytical studies to diagnose QA problems associated with laboratory processes or measurement techniques. Meteorological data support includes processing, preprocessing, visualization and other analysis techniques. Oracle database technology is used for both nuclear and meteorological databases. All models and analysis tools function in an integrated environment.

It is anticipated that the effort will only involve elements of operational support.  The contractor will be required to maintain a configuration management (CM) program for effective operation and maintenance of the RPP Data Evaluation System (DES). The CM will include the integration and updating of meteorological, statistical, data management, and other analytical tools in the RPP analysis and evaluation process. In addition, the contractor must identify, evaluate, test, implement, and document approved changes for operational systems. 

Operational support will involve: The operation and maintenance of numerous in-house systems developed for AFTAC's unique mission (see attachment 1 to this notice).  The complexity of supporting these systems requires the contractor to have, at a minimum, expertise in hardware and software CM and systems integration experience on SUN, SGI, NT, and LINUX Cluster architectures. Software expertise in Fortran (family), C (family), ADA, and Java languages is mandatory.  .

SOURCES SOUGHT- NIMH-04-SS-01  ìPUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF NEUROCOGNITIVE ASSESSMENT IN SCHIZOPHRENIA (NANS)î

Introduction: 

This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).  The purpose of this SS is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  The NIMH does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NIMHís  use of such information.   Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the NIMH's evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this SS, the NIMH may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  In the event a RFP will be issued, NAICS code 511 ñ Publishing Industries (except Internet) will apply.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the NIMH shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the NIMH's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. 

Sources Sought: 

The NIMH through UCLA , itís contractor is finalizing an assessment battery for use in clinical trials of new medications targeting the improvement of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.  The battery will consist of individual neuropsychological tests selected by experts to reflect 7 key domains of cognition impaired in schizophrenia. Some of the individual tests included in the battery are likely to be in the public domain, while others are owned by third parties who have expressed a willingness to license their use in the NIMH Battery.

NIMH wishes to make the test battery available for use in clinical trials to the widest group of academic and industry investigators possible in a rapid and cost-effective manner. Consequently NIMH seeks a contractor, with a well established national and international distribution network, to rapidly publish the NIMH Assessment of Neuropsychology in Schizophrenia (NANS) Battery, develop high quality and standardized test materials, and make the battery available for purchase at a reasonable cost to Federal grantees and at market cost to others.  Contractor will be expected to recover test material development and production costs from exclusive marketing and sales of the battery.

Since NIMH will initiate a clinical trial network no later than March 2005 that will use the test battery, expedited production of the final version of the test materials is a priority. In advance of selection of the final measures for NIMH battery (estimated October, 2004), the contractor shall negotiate licensing agreements and payment of royalties to owners of privately held test components that may be included in the final battery. A list of candidate measures will be provided by NIMH. Within three weeks of the final selection of tests, the contractor will commence creation of standardized test materials for both paper and pencil and computerized test components, and commence creation of battery administration instruction manual.  Creation and production of the battery should be completed within a rapid time frame (within four to six months) to be agreed upon by NIMH and the contractor.  The contractor will be expected to make the battery available to customers for a period of five years and to provide customer support to purchasers. A pricing schedule should be developed to offset development and dissemination costs, payments of royalties, etc. related to the instrument. The pricing schedule shall address how costs will be established to be reasonable to NIMH grantees, while allowing the contactor to maintain sufficient revenue to support the production and distribution of the test. The content of the final battery and order of administration of the specific tests in the battery is to be determined by the NIMH MATRICS Neurocognition Committee (www.matrics.ucla.edu).

Specific Tasks to be accomplished include:

1.	Negotiate licensing fees, if any, for potential battery components and secure agreements from component owners to allow use in final battery.
2.	With NIMH Project Officer, agree on final form and content of neurocognitive battery.
3.	Commence mass production and distribution of final instrument, including ensuring availability of customer support for at least five years.
4.	Create and copyright user manual describing standardized procedures for administration and scoring of Test Battery.
5.	Create high quality standardized version of all paper and pencil and computer based battery modules.
6.	Create and copyright computer program to enter test data and generate reports for export into clinical trial databases. Provide NIMH with access to computer codes supporting computerized modules.
7.	Deliver report describing marketing plan for final battery including use of extant distribution networks and sales strategies.
8.	By March 2005 deliver 200 copies of test materials to the NIMH Project Officer to support the TURNS clinical trial network.
9.	Maintain battery in inventory for purchase by NIMH grantees and other customers for five years.

Instructions for Submission: 

Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 10 pages that details the ability to perform the aspects of the effort described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business organization, e.g., Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit hospital, or other nonprofit organization, in their response.  

Responses should be identified with NIMH-04-SS-01, and are due by March 15, 2004.  E-mail responses are preferred.  Please send to pgibbons@mail.nih.gov.  Facsimile responses will also be accepted at 301-443-0501.

The United States Army Reserve Complex Vancouver Barracks is located in Vancouver, Washington, on the banks of the Columbia River, across the river from Portland, Oregon.  
 
INSTALLATION DESCRIPTION: 
 
Vancouver Barracks consists of the Administrative Training Area, the Maintenance Activities Area, and the Post Cemetery.  The complex, which once extended north from the Columbia River to Fourth Plain Boulevard, east to East Reserve Street, just west of todayís Interstate 5 and on the border of Vancouver downtown area, is now confined to 64 acres south of Officers Row.  The western half of the complex, separated by Fort Vancouver Way, is currently in the process of being acquired by the City of Vancouver.  Only the utilities east of Fort Vancouver Way (the Administrative Training Area) and south of Fifth Street (the Maintenance Activities Area) are included in this solicitation.
 The Vancouver Barracks reservation was formerly the location of the Hudson Bay Companyís principal depot in the Pacific Northwest (1825-1846) until 1849 when it became a U.S. Reservation. Since that time, it has been under continuous Federal ownership.  In the early 1850ís the post was known as Camp Vancouver, then Columbia Barracks, and was renamed Fort Vancouver in 1853.  The name Vancouver Barracks dates from 1879. In 1947, the post was turned over to the National Guard and Reserves.  The complex is now home to the 104th Infantry Division Headquarters, 1st and 3rd Brigades, and the 396th Combat Support Hospital.

Description of Facilities:  The utility systems consists of the following Capital assets:

Vancouver Barracks, WA 
 
A. Electrical Distribution System Description:
Primary power enters the complex at 12.3 kV from Clark Public Utilities, an agency of surrounding Clark County.  There is a single point of entry located at the corner of 5th Street and Fort Vancouver Way.  There are no substations or switching stations on the complex.

Specific requirements under the contract will be: (1) the ability to service all areas within Vancouver Barracks and all Federal service premises currently served by Government owned systems that are the subject of this requirement; (2) the ability to provide access to two [2] independent potable water sources to provide redundant supply linkage.  Independent potable water sources are two separate sources of supply from two separate treatment facilities.  One area of consideration [as a source] may be the existing Vancouver Barracks plant.  
 
PROCESS:  This request is to gather information from interested parties and is an essential step in determining market interest for the privatization of the electric, water, wastewater, and stormwater systems at Vancouver Barracks. In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is issued to determine market interest and feasibility as well as determining marketing strategies for privatizing the utility systems.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead.  The statement of interest must not exceed a total length of 15 pages. The statement shall include as a minimum, the following information:  (1) Capability and experience in the ownership, operation and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial Capability to purchase, upgrade, expand, operate and maintain utility systems; (3) conceptual rate plan (i.e., will charges for utility service be made from existing rates or from rates developed specifically for service at the individual installation(s); (4) discussion of your conceptual basis for a proposed purchase price (Capitalized earnings value, replacement cost new less depreciation, original cost less depreciation, or other); (5) understanding of the federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for the State of Washington and US Environmental Protection Agency Regions; (6) Company point of contact, phone no. and e-mail address.

 
SITE VISIT AND DATA:  Neither a site visit nor the provision of additional data on the utility systems is considered necessary for the preparation and submittal of statement of interest.  If a site visit and the provision of additional data are later determined necessary, notification will be provided by way of an amendment to this announcement.  
 
DUE DATE:  Statements of interest must be submitted to Defense Energy Support Center (DESC-EC) by 3:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time on Friday, March 19, 2004.

<SUBJECT>R -- Robins AFB May Fitness Month Sponsorship Opportunity
<DESC>For the entire month of May 2004 the Robins Air Force Base 78th Services Division Fitness Center will host May Fitness Month.  This is a great program to entice our community to exercise regularly.  During the month of May the Fitness Center hands out fitness bingo cards.  The bingo spaces are filled with certain classes and seminars that are offered throughout the month with the Fitness Center.  As an individual participates in these programs they get their card punched.  When they do enough programs to get a bingo they fill out their contact information on the back of the card and drop it into an entry box where they win small prizes such as a water bottle or a T-shirt depending on how many bingos they have.  The participant is then handed another bingo card to fill up with programs they attend.  At the end of the month a drawing is done out of the bingo card box and a fitness related item is given away.  For example, last year we gave away a fitness bike that was donated to us.  In order to enhance this program we would like to partner with companies and individuals who are interested in providing cash and/or in-kind for sandwiches, snacks, and drinks to nourish our participants during the classes and seminars, water bottles, T-shirts, etc. to give away to our participants when they turn in a bingo card and a fitness item to be given away as the grand prize.

Typical clerical and administrative functions to be performed include correspondence preparation, data entry, typing/filing, copying, reception, forms preparation, supply requisition, meeting coordination, mail handling, and appointment/calendar coordination. Approximately 18 Full Time Equivalent positions and four Contract Equivalent Man- years (CEM) are affected by this competition. These services are currently provided by a mix of Government and contractor personnel in Rockville, MD, serving across all nine AHRQ Offices and Centers.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesterís concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencyís goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
