This acquisition will be solicited in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. The Government will select the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment of Technical Capability, Past Performance and Price. This is a competitive best value Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) source selection solicitation. First, each proposal will be evaluated for technical acceptability on a pass/fail basis. After a proposal is determined technically acceptable, price/cost and past performance will be evaluated utilizing a PPT process. The Government will make an integrated PPT assessment and award to the technically acceptable offer considered to be the offeror who will provide the best value to the Government. The successful Contractor will be selected using performance price tradeoff procedures resulting in the best value to the Government. Past performance is significantly more important than price. Price will be evaluated for realism, completeness, and reasonableness. Offerors are cautioned that award may not be made to the Offeror submitting the lowest cost. Offerors are also advised that award may be made without discussions or any contact concerning the proposal received. Therefore, proposals should be submitted in the most favorable terms from all evaluation factors. Request for Proposals will be tentatively issued on or about 1 December 2009 with receipt of proposals tentatively scheduled on or about 31 December 2009 at 2:00 P.M. MST.

<DESC>Maurice Stephens is a 19th century (1816) masonry farmhouse with attached kitchen ell.  The main, five-bay wide, original structure was finished with exposed field stone and ridge pointing. The kitchen ell, on the east elevation of the main structure, was constructed in ca. 1840-41. The ell is field stone with rough cast mortar and whitewashed. The structure is located on the 1777-78 Winter Encampment Grand Parade and has a strong visible presence in the cultural landscape.  Although unrelated to the 1777-78 Winter Encampment, the structure represents the character of the masonry farmhouses prevalent in southeastern Pennsylvania and in the cultural landscape of Valley Forge during the late 18th and early 19th century.
Maurice Stephen's House is a contributing structure to Valley Forge NHP's National Register Nomination.
A one story, three sided bay was added to the south faade of the structure sometime prior to 1902. A portion of the exterior, masonry wall was removed at that time to incorporate the newly created interior bay space with the corresponding room.  The basement window directly beneath the bay was in-filled. The bay was later removed and the masonry wall rebuilt and the interior wall re-plastered.  Unfortunately, care was not taken to support the second floor masonry wall when the bay was removed and the second floor exterior wall settled.  This, in turn, caused the two second floor window frames to rack and the roof rafter plate to deflect.  In order to re-roof the structure effectively it was necessary to install a series of temporary screw jacks, on all floors, that effectively lifted the rafter plate and rafters into alignment with the rest of the roof.  In order to correct the window problem and the settled wall, that section of the exterior wall needs to be rebuilt from the top of the basement wall up through the second floor so that the wall once again structurally supports the rafters allowing the current screw jack supports to be removed. 
All windows are late 19th or early 20th century replacements and do not relate to the period of original construction.  Furthermore, they are not energy efficient due to deterioration of sashes that are no longer tightly fit within their frames.  The original exterior, masonry pointing has been replaced with several different campaigns of inappropriate Portland cement based, ribbon pointing in non-contiguous locations.  The original exterior doors are not weatherized and contribute to loss of heat and air infiltration.
The elevations, particularly on the north and south faade of the main, five-bay block, have been raised from their original level.  Ideally, they should be lowered to permit the new pointing to be extended to near the original ground elevation and to permit the window wells to be rebuilt and three of the four windows replaced.  Lower grade to the height of the existing retaining wall on the entire south side. (Note: existing retaining wall will NOT be demolished and a new one as noted on drawings will NOT be built.)  Remove stone foundation of the demolished three sided bay. Carefully remove the settled section of the masonry wall, from the foundation through to the rafter plate.

The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is announcing a project under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  NRCS is seeking proposal for A&E Services under Contract Number AG-3A75-C-09-0021.  A Task Order will be issued to URS Group Inc. for independent design review of an ARRA Watershed Rehabilitation project in the state of Missouri: Lost Creek Watershed, Structure B-2.  The NAICS Code for this Task Order is 541330, and the size standard is $4.5 million.  Design review with detail cost proposal from URS Group Inc. is due no later than close of business on October 29, 2009.  Negotiation procedures will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6.

The Contractor shall furnish the personnel, equipment, labor, materials, transportation, and facilities required to perform the services described herein:

The Contractor shall perform an independent review as required by the policy of the USDANatural Resources Conservation Service as stated in the National Engineering Manual (NEM) Part 501.05(a), Part 520.26 and Part 511.05(b).  The NEM defines independent review as an examination and evaluation of procedures used and decisions made during the design of a dam by peers from outside NRCS or from an organizational unit other than the one responsible for the design. The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard.  The Contractor shall assume responsibility, along with the designer, for the functional adequacy and structural soundness of the design, except in those instances where the contractors recommendations are not incorporated into the final design.  The Contractors capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to ensure that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall ensure that the design:  1) addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies, 2) safely and effectively meets the stated objectives, 3) addresses unique site conditions, 4) Is consistent with industry practice for similar structures, and 5) Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has a requirement for a bridge contract to continue professional support services in support of the Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) 3BC MK 15 CIWS Program.  As such, NAVSEA intends to award a sole source contract to EG&G Technical Services, Inc. (EG&G), 20501 Seneca Meadows Parkway, Suite 300 Germantown, MD 20876.  The Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract will be for their continuing professional support services while a separate competition for these requirements is taking place.  The intended sole source effort includes senior level, quality, acquisition management, financial management, program management, and FMS Support for the MK 15 CIWS Program.  The Contractor will provide senior level professional services and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in support of the Department of Defense and FMS requirements.  This effort includes:
.	Support for all acquisition processes associated with procurement, contracting, and equipment deliveries concerning all elements of the MK 15 CIWS Program. Acquisition, contractual and technical data support including direct support to the CIWS Program Office.
.	On-site program management support to the MK 15 CIWS Program Office.
.	Assistance in preparing budget exhibits for all appropriations in response to the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Navy (DoN) budget cycle process.  This includes assisting in the development, coordination, and tracking of execution of a DoD/DoN Program budget and providing detailed execution plans and reports on fiscal year appropriations.
.	Coordination, management and administrative support in the planning, organizing, scheduling and conduct of Program Management Reviews, Technical Management Teams, Executive Retreats, and other programmatic/engineering technical meetings, conferences and/or working groups.  Efforts also include investigation and closure of program/engineering action items.
.	Development of annual business plans and task planning sheets.  Review and analysis of available funding and field activity/contractor business plans to identify and balance yearly budget activity requirements.  .	SME in international disclosure issues, export/International Traffic in Arms compliance, and interacting with international Military and Government Representatives.  
The contract consists of a 6 month base with two 3 month options and will provide required services only until completion of the full and open competition for contractor support services to PEO IWS 3BC, under the NAVSEA SEAPORT contracting initiative.   The contract will be awarded pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  No other firm possesses the technical expertise, engineering background, or specific IWS 3BC program expertise required to perform the effort in a cost effective manner and meet the required Fleet requirements and schedule.  Any interruption in service will result in unacceptable risk to the United States Navy missile and could cause delays in responsiveness and therefore impact the procurement of the MK 15 CIWS and impact USN, Army, and international relations with FMS customers.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only and for the benefit of potential subcontractors.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact EG&G directly.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a Sole-Source contract to Thermo Environmental Instruments, Inc. (Thermo Fisher), 27 Forge Parkway, Franklin, MA, for a Partisol Plus 2025D Sequential Dichotomous Air Sampler.  The associated North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The required items are a highly specialized analytical system that will be used for a pilot study.  The study requires the use of federal equivalent methods (FEMs) for PM10-2.5. Currently the only FEM approved PM10-2.5 is the Thermo Partisol 2025D sequential dichotomous sampler.  The Thermo 2025D sequential dichotomous sampler has been used previously by the Office of Research and Development (ORD) in several field studies of PM10-2.5 mass and speciation, and procurement of the same sampler type for
the study provides the necessary consistency.  The EPA believes Thermo Environmental Instruments, Inc. is the only vendor capable of satisfying the Agency's requirements. The circumstances permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.302, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements."  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any other source(s) exists and, therefore, no Request for Proposal (RFP) is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide a capability statement but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will not be honored.  All interested parties must respond within 15 days (November 23, 2009) of the date of this announcement to William A. Newby, at 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 (Mail Code: E105).  Interested vendors shall:  1) include information on the proposed services which clearly supports the requirements outlined above; 2) fully explain your capabilities and qualifications and; 3) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  Response to this synopsis must be made in writing.  No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.

<DESC>&nbsp; In August 2005, the Social Security Administration (SSA) competitively awarded a contract to Nero Inc. for CD/DVD burning software to support SSA's new intelligent workstation and LAN environment. The product is included as part of the software image for all SSA workstations. Through the Nero contract, SSA acquired 126,390 licenses for Nero 6x Ultra Edition software. The contract also included maintenance/support services and the ability to purchase additional copies of the software. The current contract is due to expire in November 2009. The intent of this notification is to advise industry that SSA intends to continue the use of this product as part of it's workstation image, to purchase an upgrade from version 6x to version 9x for our existing licenses and plans to issue a solicitation to provide continued service and support for SSA's inventory of Nero software. The Nero product is the only known product capable of satisfying SSA's requirement. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. SSA's investment shall be assessed when accomplishing a comparison to determine if it is in the Government's best interest to switch to a different CD/DVD burning software.<br />This document does not constitute a solicitation for offers. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Pricing data is not requested or required. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be assessed before a final determination is made. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any Government evaluation of submitted information. Any responses to this notice should be submitted electronically within 7 calendar days to Dennis.Failing@ssa.gov and refer to SSA Nero CD/DVD Burning Software. <br />

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Notice HSFLGL-10-I-00001
<p>Title: Manpower Analysis and Assessment Support Services</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC).

<p>Interested parties are expected to review this Notice and the Draft Statement of Work to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>

<p>Purpose and Objectives:<br />The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.

A-76 Streamlined Competition - The Contractor shall perform Preliminary Planning tasks in preparation for an A-76 Competition, as well as participate in the conduct of the competition itself.</p>
<p>4. Business Case Analysis/Feasibility Review (BCA) - The Contractor shall conduct a BCA in order to determine whether savings and/or efficiencies could be gained by subjecting an identified activity to further analytical scrutiny, such as a Business Process Reengineering (BPR) effort or an OMB Circular A-76 Competition.</p>
<p>5. Business Process Reengineering Study (BPR) - The Contractor shall employ a systematic, disciplined improvement approach that critically analyzes an organization's mission, core functions, and delivery processes in order to achieve a more efficient and effective organization.</p>
<p>6. High Performing Organization Study - The Contractor shall validate and document an MEO's performance and expected continued savings in order to be considered by DHS and OMB to be recognized as a High Performing Organization.</p>
<p>7. Miscellaneous-The Contractor shall perform, as needed, additional taskings to include but not limited to: Post Competition Compliance Reviews, Annual COMPARE costing updates, assisting in the development of guidance and processes.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance:<br />The period of performance for this requirement is five (5) years, consisting of a one-year base period plus four (4) one-year options. The anticipated start date is July 1, 2010.</p>

<CONTACT>Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>RECOVERY  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for market research purposes.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS/QUOTES.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.

RECOVERY - The National Institute of Standards and Technology seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Small Bore Magnetic Resonance Imaging System for the NIST Advanced Technology Lab in Boulder, CO.

If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, the resulting procurement would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This potential procurement is anticipated to utilize Recovery Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.

Background 

NIST  requires a small bore (30 cm) high field (7T) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) System to aid in the development of MRI standards, phantoms (imaging artifacts), and quantitative imaging protocols.  The MRI system, to be installed in newly built lab space in Boulders B1E, will provide a core facility for the NIST BioMagnetic Imaging Program, which is tasked to provide standards and support to improve the quality, reliability, and functionality of electromagnetic-based biomedical imaging.  The system is similar to research systems that are commercially available with the exception of a few custom modifications.  These modifications include hardware and software to allow the system to operate at variable magnetic fields to match the clinical MRI scanners presently deployed at 0.5 T, 1.5 T, and 3.0 T, as well as next generation scanners at 7.0 T.  The system will be predominantly used as a metrology scanner for quantitative mapping of parameters such T1, T2, proton density, susceptibility, flow fields, and anisotropic diffusion constants.

System Specifications 

NIST requires a horizontal small-bore MRI system customized for metrology application.  The system must be able to image phantom components at 7.0 T, 3.0 T, 1.5 T and 0.5T with a resolution higher than that found in commercial clinical scanners.  The system specifications are listed:

1.  Magnet/cryogenic system

BACKGROUND.  The National Toxicology Program (NTP) within the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is an interagency program whose mission is to evaluate agents of public health concern by developing and applying tools of modern toxicology and molecular biology. The program maintains an objective, science-based approach in dealing with critical issues in toxicology and is committed to using the best science available to prioritize, design, conduct, and interpret its studies.  The evaluation of chemicals and other agents is generally conducted through a sequence of studies, which involve the exposure of laboratory rodents to these agents.  Rats and mice are appropriate models for evaluating the toxicologic and carcinogenic potential of these compounds.  The NTP utilizes the B6C3F1 hybrid mouse and various rat stocks/strains to evaluate this potential.  

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.  The NIEHS seeks capability statements from qualified small businesses to establish, operate and maintain rodent production colonies under strict barrier conditions in order to produce approximately 150 per sex of B6C3F1 mice at weekly intervals.   Additionally the contractor shall be able to produce up to 350 per sex of B6C3F1 mice at four to eight intervals as requested for a total of up to approximately 14,000 B6C3F1 mice per year for the NTP research and testing program.  To ensure continued production in the event of contamination, environmental systems failure, or natural disaster, geographically separate backup production colonies that can quickly be brought into production are required.  

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS.  Specifically, the contractor shall (1) maintain, operate and dedicate to the performance of this contract the necessary number of isolators and maximum barrier units or rooms.  Operational parameters require that all bedding, diet, cage units, and ancillary equipment be sterile; (2) rederive the C57BL/6N (e84) and C3H/HeN MTV- (e84) mice by embryo transfer or Cesarean section and establish defined micro-flora associated (modified Schaedler) foundation colonies to ensure an adequate and continuous supply of quality animals for the NTP testing program.  Offspring from these foundation colonies shall be used to establish expansion and/or production colonies to produce approximately 150 - 350 per sex of B6C3F1 mice; (3) demonstrate the capability to save embryos and sperm by cryopreservation; (4) assure nation-wide delivery of litters weaned by 21 days of age from the production colonies to the current, nine NTP end-user labs within 30 hours of having been shipped from the contractors facilities; (5) assure mice are free of viruses (PVM, Sendai, Parvo virus, (MMV, MPV), MHV, REO-3, LCMV, Hantaan, MaD, Polyoma, Ectromelia, EDIM, MNV), mycoplasma (Mycoplasma pulmonis, M. arthritidis, M. neurolyticum, M. muris), bacteria (Bordetella bronchiseptica, Corynebacterium kutscheri, Streptococcus pneumoniae, CAR Bacillus, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Citrobacter rodentium, Clostridium piliforme,  Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group D, Salmonella, , pathogenic Escherichia coli. pathogenic Helicobacter sp. such as H. hepaticus and H. bilis), protozoa (Hemobartonella, Eperythrozoon, Coccidia, Spironucleus, Giardia, Entamoeba, Trichomonas, Encephalitozoon, Toxoplasma), mycotic organisms (Microsporum, Trichophyton, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Cryptococcus, Candida, Sporotrichium, Aspergillus, Pneumocystis), helminth parasites (Heterakis, Aspicularis, Syphacia, Trichinella, Capillaria, Trichosomoides, Nippostrongylus, Angiostronqylus, Gongylonema, Moniliformis, Rodentolepis, Hymenolepis, Oochoristica, Cysticercus, Coenurus), ectoparasites (Radfordia, Psorergates, Ornithonyssus, Myocoptes, Myobia, Notoedres, Polyplax); (6) evaluate 5 per sex of the retired breeders and weanlings of the foundation, expansion, and production colonies for microbial status and health status at 4-week intervals; (7) provide total support for genetic monitoring of the foundation and expansion colonies and monitor the genetic status of the retired breeders and/or weanlings.  Documented breeding schemes used to produce genetically defined animals shall be designed to assure the homogeneity of the hybrid B6C3F1 mouse and the integral structure of the colony; (8) review the management of the colonies at least once per year by a qualified animal geneticist.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

<DESC><p>HQ FEMA's Acquisition Management Division has a requirement to provide emergency fuel distribution at forward sites for first responders during hurricane season.</p>
<p>The requirement is to deliver diesel fuel and gasoline on a regional/statewide basis to support disaster mobilization and emergency response activities including mobilization, fuel delivery, and detailed record keeping. This requirement is located at forward support sites and near by vicinities to support the national Urban Search and Rescue (US&amp;R) program, Incident Management teams, and other first responder activities in the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Emergency fuel distributors will be mobilized for a Category 3 or higher hurricane, but are activated only if the fuel infrastructure is not functioning in the impacted area.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will determine that the anticipated prices are fair and reasonable based on price analysis of the four components: cost of commercial fuel, travel (lodging, per diem), and personnel (salaries, benefits), and inherent price competition among the sources.</p>
<p>This requirement is being solicited under full and open competition to establish nation-wide coverage for all types of disasters. Contract terms and conditions will provide coverage for a base year with four one-year options. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 624230. This solicitation will account for the only solicitation for this requirement. Prospective Offerors will be given an opportunity to submit questions prior to submission of proposals. The solicitation and any amendments to the solicitation will be posted on the FedBizOpps web-page. The internet address for downloading the solicitation is http://fedbizopps.gov.

DESCRIPTION: THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-37.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 for a 100% small business set-aside.  

Background

The Food and Drug Administration regulates animal feed to ensure that the feed is safe for animals and that meat, milk and eggs from animals are safe for human consumption.  The health of humans and animals can be compromised if animal feeds contain hazardous contaminants such as pesticides, dioxins, mycotoxins, E. coli 0157:H7, Salmonella, heavy metals and other toxic elements.

Statement of Work

The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), in FDA, has initiated an animal feed surveillance program called the Feed Contaminants Compliance Program (FCCP) to monitor the presence and level of contaminants in animal feeds.  Data from feed samples collected under the FCCP by FDA district offices are recorded and stored in a FDA restricted access database, called Field Accomplishment and Compliance Tracking Systems (FACTS) database.  Under the FCCP, CVM is working to extract microbiological and mycotoxin data of the feed samples stored in the FACTS database, to reenter the microbiological and mycotoxin data in a format for further analyses, to summarize and analyze the microbiological and mycotoxin data, and to prepare draft reports for distribution to offices within FDA.  The availability of the summarized data and the draft reports will facilitate the development of a more effective surveillance program and help CVM in the determination of feed safety issues related to feed contaminants.  The subject matter expert needs to work with the Contracting Office Technical Representative to develop the report format that meets CVM needs.
    
The following are the major aspects of this project: 

1.  Extraction of microbiological and mycotoxin data on feed samples that are stored in the FDAs restricted access database  
2.  Verification of the microbiological and mycotoxin data extracted the FDAs restricted access database.
3.  Identification of feed and feed ingredients based on information in the feed sample collection report from the FDAs restricted access database
4.  Presentation of microbiological and mycotoxin data in a format that could be used to used to verify information extracted and could be used in further analyses..
5.  Preparation of semi- annual and annual reports that could be distributed to FDA Offices.

Government Furnished Properties
The contractor will work at his/her office and at Rockville, MD 20855, as appropriate.  No equipment will be provided for the contractor at his/her office.  When the contractor works at CVM, he/she will have access to a computer and printer owned by the Division of Animal Feeds (HFV-220). There is no cost to the agency associated with providing the contractor access to this computer because it is also used by other employees in the Division of Animal Feeds.  There are no specific hours during which the contractor needs to work; instead, work hours depend on the availability of information in the FACTS database and specific requests made to the contractor by the Project Manager.

<RESPDATE>112009
<CONTACT>Russell T. Reeves, Phone 3014354381, Email reevesru@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis.
<p>It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Frances Plyler, 8037 W. Hilton Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85043, to acquire continued ethics program support for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Enterprise Ethics System (NEES). The period of performance will be for a Base Period of Date of Award through 11-15-10 with two (2) successive 12-month Option Periods.</p>
<p>NEES is a secure web-based workflow management and information technology system in support of the NIH Ethics Program that assists NIH staff with meeting the required statutes and regulations governing the ethical behavior of Executive Branch employees of the Federal Government. The objective of NEES is the comprehensive automation of the NIH Ethics Program that takes into account various business policies and processes at NIH through the utilization of numerous related applications and data stores. Specifically, NEES will provide the means to electronically (1) submit all ethics-related reports and requests along with supporting documentation; (2) review and approve all ethics-related reports and requests, along with supporting documentation; and (3) track and report on all ethics-related reports and requests, submissions, reviews, and approvals as well as other related activities associated with the NIH Ethics Program.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following professional services: (1) Provide support and coordination to the NEES Working Group, whose membership consists of the ethics officials from a number of NIH Institutes/Centers (ICs) who are responsible for defining and validating the NEES business processes, workflow, and requirements; (2) Review of NEES documentation which includes a System Requirements Specification (SRS) and User-Interface prototype for each module during the Requirements Phase, and Test Cases and Scenarios during the Acceptance Test Phase; (3) Develop instructional content for each module which requires screen-specific content in the form of instructions to NEES users; and (4) Assist with user training during the implementation of each new release of NEES, including the development of training materials.</p>
<p>Ms. Plyler has been providing similar professional services to NIH for the past 3 years to the Office of the Director, NIH, and CIT.</p>
<p>CIT has determined that Frances Plyler has a unique combination of experience and expertise that makes her the only commercially available source that can provide the required continued ethics program support to NEES. She is the only source who has the required combination of senior-level subject matter expertise and extensive knowledge of all the following: (1) Federal ethics laws, policies, and programs; (2) the scientific and research mission of the NIH; and (3) the application of ethics rules at NIH which is recognized as a premier Federal biomedical research agency. She is the only source who has a combination of all of the following: (1) required knowledge and expertise of the NIH Ethics Program, (2) specialized experience working with NIH IC ethics staff members in describing the underlying goals and rationale behind the NEES business rules, and (3) the ability to gain consensus among the members of the NEES Working Group. She is the only source who has the required extensive knowledge and experience to review NEES system documentation, and an extensive working knowledge of the most current version of NEES that is critical to ensuring consistency and identifying areas of deviation from previous NEES modules. She has been uniquely involved in the development and maintenance of NEES since its inception, which includes knowledge and expertise in designing and maintaining an ethics website and a computerized tracking database for ethics actions in a Federal agency having a biomedical research mission. Having the unique combination of senior level expertise of Federal ethics laws, policies, and programs, along with the development and maintenance of NEES, Ms. Plyler is the only source who can provide ethics training tailored to the needs of NIH staff.</p>

However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their experience and expertise which will be considered by the agency. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide convincing evidence that they can fulfill all of the requirements specified above.

1.	Past Performance; (40%)
                Evaluation will be performed for existing and prior contracts for work similar in nature and complexity to                 that required by the solicitation and will include the following:
                A.    Quality of Products and Services.  Demonstrated ability to fabricate panels in accordance with                                 required specifications. Conformance to good standards of workmanship and quality control.                                   (0-10)
                B.    Customer Satisfaction.  Satisfaction of end users with the completed products and/or                                                services. (0-10)
                C.    Timeliness of Performance.  Compliance with required performance time and/or delivery                                             schedules. (0-10)
                D.    Business Relations.  Effective management, ability to manage projects involving subcontracts,                                  working relationship with the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Representatives,                                     reasonable/cooperative behavior, flexibility, effective contractor recommended solutions,                                          businesslike concern for government interests, and provides current, accurate, and complete                                  billings. (0-10)
               If there is no information on past performance available for an offeror, then that offeror will not be                evaluated favorably or unfavorably with respect to past performance. In other words, past performance                will be treated as neutral. This will be accomplished by deleting the past performance evaluation factor                and evaluating the individual offeror on the remaining criteria. 
2.	Key Personnel, including subcontractors. (30%)
                Evaluation will be based on the ability of the proposed personnel to perform work similar in nature and                 complexity to that required by the solicitation and will include the following:
                A.    Knowledge of the material culture of the mid-20th century domestic interiors;
                B.    Experience in researching and writing reports dealing with domestic, farming, and/or ranching                        structures;
                C.    Experience in conducting primary source work; and
                D.    Knowledge of the history of the settlement of the desert southwest.
3.	Samples of Work. (20%)
                Evaluation will be based on the ability of the offeror, as demonstrated by the provided samples,  to                 prepare historic furnishings reports or similar technical reports requiring primary source research.
4.	Proposed level of effort by labor category; (10%)
                Evaluation will be based on the reasonableness of the time allocated to the phases of work and the                 project as a whole.

Price will be a factor in the award decision, although the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest price. Likewise, award will not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. A thorough examination will be made to determine an offeror's adequate understanding of the Scope of Work related to proposal presentation, price (including materials) and other factors considered. The question to be decided in making the final selection will be whether proposals scoring better are worth the dollar difference (if any).As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important. As the technical merit and the evaluated cost or price become essentially equal, other factors may become the determining factor.The government will consider other factors, as listed below in descending order of importance, secondary to technical, geographical disbursement, and cost or price;
A.	HubZone small business concerns;B.	Small business concerns which are also minority owned and operated; C.	Women-owned firms; andD.	Service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms.
In addition to the evaluation of technical merit, the cost, or price, and other factors, the standards for determining an offeror's responsibility as set forth in FAR 9.104-1, will be examined and considered. Additional factors which are not specifically set forth in this solicitation, but which are prerequisites for award as implied by law, regulation or public policy will be considered in the determination of an offeror's acceptability.
All proposal information and quotation shall be submitted in an original and two copies for receipt no later than 4:30 p.m., EST, November 23, 2009 and be clearly marked with Request for Quotation Number Q1106100018.

<SUBJECT>Development of Wind Turbine/Radar Modeling Tool for Assessing the Effect of Wind Turbines on Radars
<SOLNBR>BAA10-03
<RESPDATE>010510
<CONTACT>Susan Eicher, Contracting Officer, Email susan.eicher@dhs.gov
<DESC>The mission needs of DHS, Department of Defense (DoD), and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) dictate that the nations radar systems remain uninhibited, to the maximum extent possible, by man-made obstructions.  DHS and DoD have been charged with securing and defending the nation and part of that undertaking is accomplished through the ability to monitor non-cooperative aircraft within the nations airspace.  NOAA is charged with, keeping citizens informed of the changing environment to include weather forecasts, severe storm warnings, and climate monitoring.  All agencies rely heavily on surveillance and weather radars to accomplish their respective missions.  Unfortunately, studies conducted both within the United States and within the United Kingdom reveal that wind turbines do indeed have an adverse effect on our radars.  

The stakeholders intent is not to impede the propagation of wind turbines but to discover a means to co-exist.  To that end, it is imperative that the necessary tools are developed to accurately portray the impact that the turbines will have on the nations radar systems.   The current process, although somewhat effective, lacks the capability to allow a determination of the actual extent and degree of the impact on radars, thus lending itself to a great deal of subjectivity.  The overall goal with this effort is to develop a sound, unimpeachable impact assessment methodology that eliminates the subjectivity inherent in current procedures.

The main users of this system will be management personnel, engineers, technical analysts, and operations personnel from DHS, DoD, and NOAA. Other users may include engineers from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and representatives from the Wind Industry.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled COMPOSITE CURING OVEN,NNC10312726Q   which was posted on Nov 05, 2009. You are notified that the followingchanges are made: Below are all the technical questions that were submitted in regards to the originalposing.  After each question is the corresponding technical answer from the requester/enduser.  Also please note that the closing date for this posing has been extended.  Pleasesee the new date at conclusion of this modification.What is the source Power. i.e. 110Volts, 220V, 440V ?	   220V or 440V Either will workIs the awardee responsible for hook up and final certification or is that an internalfunction?   Oven should be shipped assembled, but we can hook it up and certifyinternally.Is there a maximum temperature?  NoMax weight?  No- within reason. Does the chamber need to be vented to outdoors?  No, but there should be a ventRisk of explosion?   YesOperating Voltage 480V 3 ph 60 Hz?   That will workAir flow volume and velocity?	Not specified, only require both vertical and horizontalflowDo you have a preference for the oven interior?   Does this refer to the dimensions? 2 ftwide by 2 ft long by 2 ft high.   Or does it refer to the material?  Able to withstand1000F processing tempWhat will be the normal operating temperature?	In our experience composite curing ovenstypically operate in the range of 350F to 450F.  Why the rating for up to 1000F?   Normal operating temp will be between 350 to 450F.  We would like to be able to go higherif the need arises for BMI and/or polyimide composites.What is the size and weight of the load?    Size is approx. 1ft by 1ft composite panel,an accompanying vacuum bag assembly.  ~ 50 lbsYou have specified the rate of heat up.  At what rate do you wish to cool, and to whattemperature?   Not sure but would like something like 5F per minute to control residualstressesThis is a small chamber, at only 8 cubic ft.  Can we assume that outside height includesa floor stand?	Yes.Our normal practice would be to have an external vacuum header, with legs projecting intothe chamber, terminating in barb type connections or quick disconnect fittings.  Acustomer-supplied line connects the port to the bagged part, and a line from the baggedpart then leads out to a second port, where we have a vacuum transducer.  This allows usto read the actual vacuum on the bagged parts.	Your specs seem to call for twotransducers for each location, and we would assume one would be mounted on each legprojecting into the oven from the external header, in addition to those mounted"downstream" of the bagged parts.  Is this correct?  If so, what sort of connections andlines would you plan to use on the interior that could stand up to 1000F?     The normaloperation will be 350  450.	This wasnt specified.	Maybe quick disconnects couldwork.What sort of digital recording unit do you prefer?  In composite curing ovens we wouldnormally provide an Allen Bradley PLC and Panel View interface.  All signals from thevacuum transducers would be fed into the PLC, which can be connected via Ethernet to thecustomer's computer system for data acquisition, archiving and printout.     What youvedescribed is what we are looking for.What electrical service do you have that would be used for this unit - 230V/3 phase/60Hz, 440-480V/3 phase/60 Hz., etc.?    Either can workAre we building a vacuum chamber oven or is the customer pulling a vacuum on a bag thatis put over their product inside of the oven chamber?  Pulling a vacuum on a bagWhat make and model are specification from?   Combined feedback from several vendorsAre you looking for a specific brand of Oven?  NoConclusion:  Please remember that all responses, bids and/or all questions are to be via e-mail (Dorothy.E.Viancourt@nasa.gov ),  fax:	216-433-2480 (attn: DE Viancourt), or the 1449form (see below or refer back to original posting).

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information (RFI):<br />MILSATCOM Commercial Acquisition Options</strong></p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICITATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.</p>
<p><strong>Background &amp; Description</strong><br />This Request for Information (RFI) by the USAF Space and Missile Center (SMC) seeks to determine commercial acquisition options for satisfying future Military Satellite Communication (MILSATCOM) needs.</p>
<p>SMC is interested in determining the extent to which emerging commercial capabilities can be leveraged for the acquisition of MILSATCOM capabilities either through the hosting of payloads or tailored procurement of Commercial SATCOM systems. SMC is also interested in suggested changes to acquisition and business approaches (e.g. specifications, contracting, policy, legal, ITU).</p>
<p>No telephone inquiries will be accepted. All inquiries (technical, contractual, administrative), questions, or clarifications of any kind must be submitted via email to the (POC) listed below. Regarding this RFI, direct contact or one-on-one meetings with a contracting officer, program manager, or technical parties, is not allowed, apart from the Government Exchange Meetings described later in the RFI.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong><br />This RFI supports the following specific objectives:</p>
<p>&bull; Gathering information on current and future Commercial SATCOM systems and business models that may be tailorable and affordable to meet DoD SATCOM needs. The spectrum of current business models under consideration includes. <br />&bull; (1) FAR Part 12 Modified Commercial Payload (firm fixed price) acquisition to meet DoD requirements for hosting on a commercial satellite<br />&bull; (2) Military payload acquisition for hosting on a commercial satellite (Government Furnished Equipment)<br />&bull; (3) DoD payload functions designed into commercial satellite (DoD payload drives satellite design) <br />&bull; (4) Purchase tailored Commercial Satellite (FAR Part 12) <br />&bull; (5) DoD funding technology/capability development/maturation of desired capabilities/interfaces that could be integrated into commercial satellites (Payloads or Bus) <br />&bull; Gathering information on current and future Commercial SATCOM technical capabilities that could be tailored to provide dedicated DoD payload capabilities for separate hosting<br />&bull; Gathering information on acquisition constraints associated with application of military requirements <br />&bull; Gathering holistic business case information (approach, schedule, life cycle cost, risk) relevant to DoD commercial SATCOM acquisitions including terminal, teleport, network and ground interfaces, to support comparative analyses to inform go forward planning<br />&bull; Gathering information on the compatibility/sensitivity of commercial solutions to meet traditional military requirements and accommodating the constraints of tactical-edge joint-terminals (e.g. Army/Ground, Navy, Airborne), teleports, networked systems, host platforms (AISR, Ships, Ground Vehicles) and related operations concepts<br />&bull; Enabling definition of potential follow-system PRDAs to define new business/architectural approaches exploiting commercial SATCOM</p>
<p>Not under consideration for this RFI are commercial bandwidth DISA/GSA type service lease models nor related brokered leased business arrangements. Responses to one or more parts of this RFI will be accepted as well responses to this general area of interest to help inform a Gov't Commercial SATCOM go forward path. The commercial concepts and desired military SATCOM features under consideration are shown in appropriate sections below</p>
<p><strong>Topics for Responses</strong><br />Briefly and clearly describe your views on a DoD commercial SATCOM acquisition focused on the following levels:</p>
<p>(1) Acquisition of a modified commercial payload for hosting; <br />(2) Capability for hosting a DoD-furnished payload<br />(3) Acquisition of a modified full end-to-end Commercial SATCOM System (satellite, ground, teleports, other). <br />(4) General business contexts</p>
<p>To clarify context, suggested questions are included below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Acquisition of a Modified Commercial Payload for Separate Hosting</span></p>
<p>The concept for this topic is that DoD would purchase a modified (FAR Part 12) commercial payload for a separate hosting on a commercial satellite. This topic addresses only the modification of a commercial payload to meet DOD needs, using a firm fixed price contract vehicle. It is important that the resulting modified commercial payload is interoperable and compatible with DoD user terminals, ground infrastructure, and wideband/other MILSATCOM systems.</p>
<p>&bull; What are modified commercial concepts that could support a dedicated DoD payload?</p>
<p>&bull; To what extent could a base commercial payload be tailored to meet DoD needs or desired features?</p>
<p>&bull; Address any impacts to existing DoD ground and user terminal infrastructure that may be required to accommodate a modified commercial payload solution</p>
<p>&bull; What are example schedule timelines and costs for developing a modified commercial payload for DoD use?</p>
<p>&bull; Does the respondent have technologies that could be incorporated on a tailored commercial payload that would require an additional investment by DoD?</p>
<p>&bull; Please consider the following list of Military SATCOM features:</p>
<p>&bull; Military frequency use/reuse, multiplexing to avoid commercial frequency contention<br />&bull; Compatibility with fleet-wide legacy terminals (to preserve large investment) without specialized upgrades or control software<br />&bull; Airborne (aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) wideband SATCOM terminal constraints with small antenna<br />&bull; Communications to small mobile terminals (weather, blockage)<br />&bull; Beam handovers for moving terminals (continuity of service)<br />&bull; Anti-jamming/interference/geolocation <br />&bull; Modem and antenna technologies <br />&bull; Adaptable coverage areas to optimize in-theater capacities for a typical areas of operations (AOR)<br />&bull; Dynamic provisioning techniques<br />&bull; High data rate &amp; throughput<br />&bull; Adaptive weather change accommodation<br />&bull; Ground and gateway/teleport control <br />&bull; Support of military multi-level precedence and pre-emption (MLPP)<br />&bull; Differential treatment of traffic flows via Quality of Service (QoS) provisions<br />&bull; Dynamic provisioning of capacity via QoS<br />&bull; Load balancing across a transponder and terminal via power control schemes<br />&bull; Information Assurance/Security<br />&bull; Space situational awareness and Space Protection<br />&bull; Military control of payload and teleport functions including access control, security, information assurance, network operations (Internet Packet and Telemetry, Tracking and Control)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Capabilities for Hosting a DOD-furnished Payload (Government Furnished Equipment)</span></p>
<p>The concept for this topic is that DoD would procure a military communications payload and then provide this payload to a commercial operator for rapid capability insertion into a commercial satellite to meet theater-specific surge requirements. Please consider the following questions related to this topic:</p>
<p>&bull; The above (Question 1) list of desired Military SATCOM features should be considered in responding to this RFI topic:</p>
<p>&bull; What degree of influence would DoD be able to assert over the host satellite operations (e.g., orbital placement, military control of sensitive payload items, control of related sensitive operations such as anomaly reporting and bus management, control of bandwidth prioritization/pre-emption).</p>
<p>&bull; Is there a level of standardized hosted payload interfaces that could be built into each satellite manufactured in a fleet to enable quick reaction payload insertion?</p>
<p>&bull; What are the key decision points in a commercial development schedule for DoD participation with a hosted payload approach?</p>
<p>&bull; What are the possible physical attributes (e.g. SWAP) of hosted communication payloads that could be accommodated on a commercial satellite? What are the constraint, issues, and business arrangements that may be required for different physical attributes of hosted payload?</p>
<p>&bull; At what point is a hosted payload no longer a viable appliqu&eacute; (e.g., payload drives overall satellite design)? What are the considerations, constraints, and business issues of DoD payload being accommodated as part of the commercial satellite design as opposed to a flexible hosted service?</p>
<p>&bull; What are potential cost considerations for accommodating a hosted payload in terms of initial cost to integrate, amount of commercial capability displaced, and on-going operations &amp; maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, continuing sustainment cost? For Government comparison purposes to other enterprise solutions, please offer cost estimates for hosting DoD payloads and follow-on O&amp;M during the lifetime of the payload/satellite.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Acquisition of a Modified Full End-to-End Commercial SATCOM System</span></p>
<p>The intent of this final topic is for DoD to purchase a modified (FAR Part 12) Commercial SATCOM system (space or space with ground components) as a firm fixed price commercial procurement. It is important that the purchased commercial system is interoperable and compatible with DoD user terminals, ground infrastructure, and other wideband MILSATCOM systems.</p>
<p>&bull; The above (Question 1) list of desired Military SATCOM features should be considered in responding to this RFI topic:</p>
<p>&bull; What are the current and planned commercial offerings that may be suitable for tailored use by the military?</p>
<p>&bull; What are the range of modifications to the commercial systems that could be accommodated while keeping the procured system within the intent of a firm fixed price contract?</p>
<p>&bull; Address any impacts to existing DoD ground and user terminal infrastructure that may be required to accommodate a modified Commercial SATCOM system</p>
<p>&bull; Please address any launch vehicle opportunities/constraints.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. General Business Context</span></p>
<p>For these alternatives, what is your model for Government acquisition arrangements? How do you see contract performance risk being allocated? What are your proposed provisions for Government oversight during the acquisition (configuration management of military functions, license arrangements, business oversight, design oversight, differences from DoD policies)? What sorts of performance warranties are envisioned? What DoD/Gov't procurement processes would need modification? What factors associated with insurance would the Gov't need to address?</p>
<p>What business arrangements/changes would increase DoD influence over commercial consideration of military capabilities? Factors include alignment with commercial customer sales models (e.g. compatibility, schedules), leases, sustainment (e.g. maintenance and configuration management of military capabilities), data rights, ITU military frequency filing constraints, commercial host nation constraints (e.g. shared teleports or control stations), FAR constraints (FAR Part 12/15), appropriations law (e.g. anti-deficiency act). Please specify the obstacles that limit the Government's ability to fully leverage commercial opportunities and your suggestions for eliminating or mitigating these obstacles.</p>
<p>Please provide an estimate of the cost impact associated with full DoD oversight.</p>

(a) Invoice payments
(5) Computing penalty amount. The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.
(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the  7th  day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivers the supplies or performs the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.

52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.

Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities.

Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.

Registered in the CCR database means that--

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active.

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--

(i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or

(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:

(i) Company legal business.

(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.

(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.

(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).

(v) Company Telephone Number.

(vi) Date the company was started.

(vii) Number of employees at your location.

(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.

(ix) Line of business (industry).

(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).

(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.
(End of clause)

The time stated for completion shall include final cleanup of the premises. 
(End of clause)

52.211-13     TIME EXTENSIONS (SEP 2000)

Time extensions for contract changes will depend upon the extent, if any, by which the changes cause delay in the completion of the various elements of construction. The change order granting the time extension may provide that the contract completion date will be extended only for those specific elements related to the changed work and that the remaining contract completion dates for all other portions of the work will not be altered. The change order also may provide an equitable readjustment of liquidated damages under the new completion schedule.

(End of clause)

52.232-33  PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERCENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)

(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term EFT refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.

(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--

(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or

(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).

(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.

(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.

(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 

(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--

(i) Making a correct payment;

(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and

(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.

(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--

(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or

(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.

(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.

(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.

(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.

(4) Registered in the CCR database means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, if applicable, and the corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number and the CAGE code have been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed.

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.

	J.16. Offerors lacking relevant present/past performance experience may submit information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement if such information is relevant to this acquisition. Such information shall, as a minimum, include: (1) Name(s) of Predecessor Company/Subcontractor and/or Key Personnel; (2) Complete Address: (3) Telephone, Fax Number and email address; (4) Brief synopsis of the experience (a resume may be submitted for "Key Personnel") (5) Describe in detail relevancy to this project.   Note that use of subcontractors or key personnel to obtain relevant past performance shall commit the offeror to use the proposed personnel/subcontractors in the performance of the contract. 

 	J.17 Evaluation: Relative Experience and Past Performance:  The SSEB shall evaluate relative Past Performance by considering such factors as similarity of test cell, an offeror's business practices, customer relationship, offerors ability to successfully perform on prior relevant contracts.  The SSEB will consider in their evaluation recent and relevant past performance and responses to prior clients questionnaires.  Current, Relevant, Trends:  Evaluators will consider the current, relevant and trends of the performance information while conducting its performance evaluation.  Current is performance occurring within the past five (5) years prior to the solicitation release date.  Within this period, performance occurring later in the period may have greater significance than work occurring earlier in the period.

		J.18. Based on the evaluation results, the proposal will be assigned one of five (5) confidence ratings.  The ratings and related definitions that will be used to define the confidence the Government has in the offerors ability to successfully perform the contract work.

		J.19. An offeror with no Past Performance may receive a rating based on the evaluation of its predecessor companies, key personnel, and/or subcontractors. These ratings may not have the same weight as the ratings of the proposing company.   If such information is not applicable (i.e., the offeror does not have a predecessor company, key personnel or subcontractors with relevant experience), the offeror shall be evaluated as "neutral. However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant Past Performance history, while rated Neutral in Past Performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offerors. 

		J.20. In evaluating performance confidence, the Government may contact your references for additional information and to assure validity of the received questionnaires. The Government may contact sources other than those provided by the offeror for information with respect to past performance. These other sources may include, but are not limited to telephone interviews, and Government personnel with personal knowledge of the offerors performance capability.  The Government reserves the rights to obtain and evaluate past performance information from any source it deems appropriate.

		J.21. In accordance with FAR 15.106(a)(2), if award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposals, e.g., the relevance of an offeror's past performance information or to resolve minor clerical errors. Offerors shall be provided an opportunity to address any negative past performance information about which the Offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. 
Thursday, January 31, 2008

	J.22. Organization and Technical Approach.  This information considers the offerors proposed technical approach to executing compliance with the Statement of Work.. 

	J.23.	Organization:  Describe what firms, their resources and how their resources will be utilized, their roles and responsibilities and any contractual arrangements that have been established. 
	
	J.24. Describe the technical approach to designing and constructing the turn key test cell Dyno in support of the X1100 Transmission and other previously mentioned transmissions.  Address each element defined in the Statement of Work and how you propose to address and satisfy the Dyno performance requirements.  Provide a preliminary schedule indicating a time line from date of award until completion of final Dyno training. Describe your warranty and list any specific exclusion from the warranty, if applicable.   

		J.25. Describe your quality control approach, corporate systems and capabilities to maintain quality control of the project.  Describe the proposed quality control organization, including the proposed staffing plan.  The Government is interested in demonstrable capabilities to assure quality control and how the offeror will maintain quality control throughout the project.
	
	J.26.  The Contractor shall identify in their proposal a Project Manager who will function as the single point of contact between the Contractor and Government.  The proposal must contain a resume of experience this individual has in the supervising and oversight of the Dyno design, manufacture and installation process. The Contractors Project Manager shall be responsible to develop and furnish to the Government within 45 days from date of contract award a detailed project schedule that will enable the tracking of progress and action item status.  The proposal shall include a preliminary schedule showing critical milestones in the design, manufacture, and installation and testing of the provided test cell. 

		 
	J.27. Evaluation: Organization and Technical Approach -- The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and any deficiencies in the offerors proposal and understanding of the Dyno technical and functional requirements.  The evaluation will include the offerors capability to execute the project. Some additional specific evaluation considerations are listed below.  However, this list is not all-inclusive. 

	J.28. Organization:  The SSEB will evaluate the clarity and strength of the overall technical approach and how well the proposal defines the process they will utilize to execute the entire scope of work.  
	
	J.29. Processes during Design and Construction:  The SSEB will evaluation the realism of the preliminary schedule showing the critical milestones in the design, manufacture, installation and training proposed for the test cell.  The evaluation will include the prior experience of the Project Manager in delivery of similar Dyno projects.   
	
	J.30. The SSEB will evaluate the offeror technical approach to designing and constructing the turn key Dyno test cell.  They will evaluate the proposal as to how each element of the Statement of Work was addressed in the proposal indicating understanding of the requirement and how they intended to satisfy the overall Dyno performance requirements.  The SSEB will evaluate the offerors warranty and specific exclusions in the one-year warranty.   

		J.31. The SSEB will evaluate the offerors quality control approach, corporate systems and capabilities to maintain quality control of the project.  They will evaluate the offerors quality control organization, including the proposed staffing plan and how the offeror will maintain quality control throughout the project.

	J.32. Oral Presentation:  Upon receipt of all written proposals the SSEB shall schedule and interview all offerors determined to be within the competitive range. Oral presentation will not be scored or evaluated separately.   Oral presentations will normally be followed by a SSEB question and answer period for clarification purposes. The location for presentations will be provided with the presentation date and time assignment.  The purpose of the oral presentations is to provide the offeror with the opportunity to briefly explain any specific documentation provided, to highlight the special features of their proposal, and to identify the benefits of the offerors technical data proposal.  Any betterments or deviations that the offeror wishes the Government to consider should be discussed in detail in the oral presentation. The offeror is expected to highlight significant technical points contained in their proposal but will not be permitted to submit anything new, but may expand on anything contained in the proposal. Offerors are cautioned that all information provided, regardless of the format, i.e. written proposal, oral presentation, shall be considered as proposal information, and used in the evaluation process.
 
Section K - Evaluation Factors for Award

(See Section L for proposal submission and evaluation of selection factor) 
              K.1 Basis of Award:  The award shall be based on the evaluation of three factors: (1) Relevant Past Performance (2) Organization and Technical Approach and (3) Price (within the stipulated price limitation).  Evaluated within the factor Organization and Technical Approach include two sub factors (1) Demonstrated compliance with the SOW and (2) Demonstrated understanding the requirements of the facility addition/enclosure.  Relevant Past Performance and Organization and Technical Approach is approximately equal in value and when combined is more important than price, provided the price is within the stipulated price limitation.   Adjective evaluation ratings (shown below) will be provided for Relative Past Performance and Organization and Technical Approach.    
	      K.2. Price:   The purpose of the price/cost evaluation is to determine whether an offerors proposed prices/costs for the project are reasonable and realistic in relation to the solicitation requirements and demonstrates an offerors understanding of the proposal requirements.  Price is not separately rated.

	a. The Government will conduct a price/cost evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine whether or not each proposal complies with the stated criteria: "Reasonableness" and Realism". In determining overall cost to the Government for evaluation and selection purposes, the price proposed by an offeror who provides benefits/betterments within the stipulated price limitation may be afforded greater consideration than on offeror who proposes a lower price for basic requirements. 

	b. Price evaluation will consider reasonableness and realistic prices associated with the offerors overall technical proposal solution.  Those proposals evaluated as not satisfying all of the price/cost criteria may be eliminated from further consideration unless the Contracting Officer determines:  A minor clerical error has occurred, then the offeror may be given an opportunity to correct the minor error within the constraints of the "clarifications" process or the Contracting Officer determines discussions are required.  Reasonableness of an offeror's proposal is evaluated through price analysis techniques as described in FAR Subpart 15.305(a)(1) and (4).  

	c. For the price to be reasonable, it must represent a price that provides value to the Government when consideration is given to prices in the market, technical and functional capabilities of the offeror. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.  For price to be realistic, it must reflect what it would cost the offeror to perform the effort if the offeror operates with reasonable economy and efficiency. 

	d. Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly explained in the price proposal.  For example, if unique and innovative approaches or conditions are the basis for an unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented.  The burden of proof of price realism rests solely with the offeror.

	K.3. The Contracting Officer will award a firm fixed price contract to that responsible Offeror whose proposal the Source Selection Authority has determined conforms to the solicitation, is fair and reasonable, and the offers the best overall value to the Government, considering all non-priced factors described herein, and price. All evaluation factors, other than price, when combined are considered approximately equal to price, however the contract award price shall not exceed $1,570,000.00.   The intent of this solicitation is to obtain the best proposal within the cost limitation. There is no obligation to approach or match the cost limitation in the offer.  After the Government individually evaluates and rates each proposal, the Contracting Officer/Source Selection Authority will compare the RFP requirements to determine which proposal represents the best value.  The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer or to reject all offers.  The Government will not award a contract to an Offeror whose proposal contains a deficiency, as defined in FAR 15.0001.  If there is a lower priced conforming offer(s), the Contracting Officer/Source Selection Official must determine that the added value of more expensive proposal (within the cost limitation) would justify award to that offeror.  As part of the evaluation, the Government will evaluate betterments in proposals relative to the minimum standards of the RFP to determine if they offer additional value to the Government.      
      
	Organization and Technical Approach Ratings and Definitions: 

Excellent	Proposal demonstrates excellent understanding of the requirements and approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards.  Proposal has exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Agency.  Very good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting government requirements.  
Good	Proposal demonstrates a good understanding of requirements and approach that exceeds performance or capability standards.  Proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the Agency.  Good probability of success with overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the agencys requirements.  
Satisfactory	Proposal meets most of the solicitation requirements and demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements. Advantages were offset by disadvantages.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications given by offeror were acceptable.  Fair probability of success with overall moderate degree of risk in meeting the Agencys requirements.
Marginal	Proposal demonstrates shallow understanding of requirements and approach that only marginally meets performance or capability standards necessary for minimal, but acceptable contract performance. Proposal would require major rewrites to make it acceptable. Probability of success is questionable without discussions with the offeror.     
Unsatisfactory	Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations; there is an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Agencys requirements. Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies and these conditions cannot be corrected without a major rewrite or resubmission.  Unacceptable risk, not awardable as proposed

 

             Relative Past Performance Confidence Ratings:   The following ratings and related definitions will be used to define the performance risk:

Very High Degree of Confidence	Performance met all contract requirements and exceeded many to the Government's benefit.  Problems, if any, were negligible and were resolved in a timely and highly effective manner.  Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant.  Excellent probability of success with overall very high degree of confidence the contractor will meet or exceed the Government's requirements.  
High Confidence	Performance met contract requirements. Good quality. Minor problems may have been identified however; contractor took satisfactory corrective action to resolve where appropriate. Performance was current and generally very relevant to relevant. Good probability of success with overall high degree of confidence in meeting the government's requirements.
Average Confidence	Performance met most contract requirements. Adequate quality. Problems were identified however; contractor usually took adequate corrective action. Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant.  OR Although performance generally exceeds expectations and was generally rated excellent to very good the projects submitted were semi-relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation. Fair probability of success with an average degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government's requirements.
Below Average Confidence	Performance met some contract requirements. Fair quality. Problems were identified however; contractor sometimes took corrective action, but not always to the owners satisfaction. Performance was current and generally very relevant to semi-relevant. Probability of success is unclear with an overall below average degree of confidence the contractor will meet the government's requirements. 
Low Degree of Confidence	Performance did not meet some contractual requirements. There were problems, some of a somewhat serious to serious nature. Contractor's corrective action was sometimes marginally effective to ineffective. Performance was current and generally relevant to semi- relevant. Probability of success is questionable with an unacceptably low degree of confidence the contractor will meet the governments requirements.  
Neutral	No current and/or relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction. A search was unable to identify any relevant Past Performance information for the offeror or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel. This is neither a negative or positive assessment. Unknown

<DESC>RECOVERY - IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA), PUBLIC LAW 111-5, THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA), NATIONAL CAPITAL ACQUISITION DIVISION, HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS BRANCH, INTENDS TO ACQUIRE SYSTEM INTEGRATION SUPPORT SERVICES FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING SUPPORT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING PROGRAM.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to acquire system integration support services for High Performance Computing support of the Environmental Modeling program. At a minimum, the contractor will be required to provide the following: (1) transition support from NOAA's current Research and Development High Performance Computing System (R&amp;D HPCS) contract which expires September 30, 2010; (2) acquisition and implementation of a Home File System; (3) assist in the design, acquisition, implementation, and support of NOAA's next generation R&amp;D HPCS. The R&amp;D HPCS is necessary to support NOAA's continued advances in environmental modeling capabilities and to meet other high performance computing requirements that may arise within NOAA and at other partner agencies. The primary acquisition goal is to acquire balanced, comprehensive computing capabilities configured from commercially-available items including processors, storage, software, support, and maintenance services that will allow NOAA to meet its increasing processing requirements.</p>
<p>Environmental models developed and maintained by NOAA scientists are run on systems currently operated by three NOAA organizations: Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) in Boulder, Colorado; the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in Princeton, New Jersey; and the National Weather Service's National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) located in Camp Springs, Maryland.</p>
<p>The contract will be divided into a four year base period, followed by a four year option period. During the base period, the contract will be renewed each year subject to the availability of funds. The decision to exercise the four year option period will be made by evaluating a proposal submitted by the incumbent contractor. If the option period is exercised, the contract will be renewed each of the following years in the option period, subject to the availability of funds. Also included in the contract will be a transition option for the Government to exercise at any time. The intent of this one year transition option is to provide the Government with sufficient time to complete a competitive follow-on acquisition should it be necessary. The total period of the contract could be as long as nine years.</p>
<p>The contract will include two indefinite quantity options. The first indefinite quantity option provides a capability to acquire additional HPCS components or systems. These additional components or systems  could be used to satisfy unanticipated NOAA requirements or requirements from a partnering agency, and will be established with fixed ceiling amounts. The second indefinite quantity option will provide engineering services (e.g., applications analyst, systems/network/security engineer, and facilities engineer) on a fixed-price basis to be determined at the task/delivery order level.</p>
<p>The total estimated ceiling amount of this acquisition, inclusive of all options, and based upon maximum quantities for the indefinite quantity options, is $317.2 million. An annual project funding profile for the system life, inclusive of all options, is provided in the Request for Proposal (RFP). The system acquired during the base contract period will be purchase utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds. Should the four year option contract period be exercised, it is anticipated that any system(s) delivered during this period will be acquired through a leasing arrangement.</p>
<p>Pre-Solicitation Notice DG133H-09-RP-0168 is changed to read Solicitation DG1330-10-RP-0168.  The Government anticipates awarding a contract in May 2010. The complete RFP titled, "DG1330-10-RP-0168 - R&amp;D HPCS - 05 November 2009" is now available at http://rdhpcs.noaa.gov/2009/.

Yes, proposals will be considered if they propose a technology that is not written on Java.&nbsp; As you may be aware, this programming is a standard used within the web development community at this time but advancements in this technology environment are changing constantly.&nbsp; The OFCCP wanted to establish a baseline for software application development environment that is generally available to the Vendor community.</span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Garamond">A.

<h4>Description:</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE</span>: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), GE3313 Communications Section, Fort Monmouth, NJ is conducting this RFI as market research to determine sources with competencies <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">to promote IPv6 standards work by supporting t</span>he IPv6 Standard Support task.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The support being identified will be provided to a subordinate DISA organization, GE 3313 Communications Section, located at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Interface Standards Division and its Branch (GE331) are a part of the DISA Systems Engineering Center (GE3).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Systems Engineering Center's principal mission and functions center on providing architecture, systems engineering, IT Standards, modeling and simulation analysis, and Global Information Grid (GIG) enterprise engineering for DISA programs and its customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective of this effort is to obtain contractor support specifically for the Communications Section (GE3313) mission to maintain a library of commercial standards for Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) in the Defense Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR) and the publication of the annual update of the Department of Defense Standard Profiles for IPv6 Capable Products.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Department of Defense has moved away from the use of Military Standards to commercial standards based acquisitions. However, commercial standards often lack the support for DOD's critical and essential requirements. For this reason, it is of critical importance to influence the development of commercial standards, so that DOD unique and essential requirements are incorporated in selected commercial standards. This requires research to develop technical proposals for commercial standards organizations. The commercial standard organization of interest to this task is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.</p>

Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for IPv6 Standards Support contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>

Reference: Test Program for Commercial Items (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) or the authority of the Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003 (41 U.S. C. 428a) as stated in FAR 13.501(a) (1) (ii), which states for acquisitions over $100,000.00 using the authority of the test program for commercial items, the contracting agency is required to prepare a sole source (including brand name) justification using the format at FAR 6.303-2, as provided below.

1.  Contracting Office  Defense Finance and Accounting / Contract Services Directorate, DFAS Columbus.

2.  Type of Contract Action    The proposed contract type is an open market sole source contract to JD Donahue & Associates (JDDA) using simplified acquisition procedures under the authority of FAR Part 13.501 in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services  The requirement is for the contractor to serve as the integrator of a major upgrade to the existing DFAS check printing and handling systems.  Advice of payment (AOP) printers, and document inserters have exceeded their expected useful life and can no longer be supported by the manufacturer.  The existing cutters are currently serviceable but must be refurbished if they are expected to function through out the life cycle of the new AOP printers and document inserters.  The existing check printing and handling systems consist of multiple pieces of equipment to include check printers, loop/web controllers, unwind units, AOP printers, document inserters and postprint verification equipment.  The list below represents some of the major systems generating payment files.

SRD1  		STANFINS REDESIGN SUBSYSTEM 1
DDS   		DEPLOYABLE DISBURSING SYSTEM
ADS   		AUTOMATED DISBURSING SYSTEM
CDS    		COMBAT DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM
MOCAS	MECHANIZATION OF CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION SERVICES
EBS		ENTERPRISE BUSINESS SYSTEM
IATS		INTEGRATED AUTOMATED TRAVEL SYSTEM
DTS		DEFENSE TRAVEL SYSTEM
RTS		RESERVE TRAVEL SYSTEM
DCPS		DEFENSE CIVILIAN PAY SYSTEM
DJMS		DEFENSE JOINT MILITARY PAY SYSTEM
MCTFS	MARINE CORPS TOTAL FORCE SYSTEM
DRAS		DEFENSE RETIRED/ANNUITANT PAY SYSTEM
CAPS		COMPUTERIZED ACCOUNTS PAYABLE SYSTEM
IAPS		INTEGRATED ACCOUNTS PAYABLE SYSTEM

Services to be purchased include are the acquisition, configuration and modification of new AOP printers, integrated document stackers, and document inserters, as well as refurbishing the document cutters and modification of other existing hardware and software interfaces to integrate the new components into the existing system. Additionally, this requirement includes the installation of the new components and training for equipment operators.

All of the included equipment and services must be fully integrated by JDDA due to the custom nature of the configuration and the interdependency of all of the hardware, interfaces, and the proprietary JDDA software.  JDDA is the only supplier that has all of the knowledge to properly install and configure the equipment being purchased.

Total estimated price for the procurement is $X,XXX,XXX.XX.

4.  Authority Cited   10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) as stated in FAR 6.301.  

FAR 6.302-1 permits contracting without providing for full and open competition if supplies are from a limited number of sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The specific exception that applies to this acquisition is FAR 6.302-1(a) (2)(ii), Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including the major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in : 
(A)     Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B)     Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agencys requirements (se 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B).

5.  Reason for Authority Cited The check printing and document handling process is comprised of integrated, highly specialized hardware and software developed as a joint venture by DFAS, JDDA, and hardware manufacturers over a period of time exceeding 20 years.  The printing and processing capabilities of the system are made possible by the integration of hardware, software and firmware customized for DFAS printing and processing requirements by JDDA and the equipment manufacturers. Unlike most mid volume check printing operations, DFAS check printing and handling systems must accept files from multiple disbursing and entitlement systems, each providing files in a different format.  Specialized software has been developed to receive multiple check file formats and output the data to a U. S. Treasury approved print format .  The proprietary software was designed and developed by JDDA and has been maintained by JDDA for over 20 years during which time, no competitive applications have been identified.  In order to integrate replacement hardware into this processing system, JDDA must ensure that the replacement hardware and operating systems are fully compatible with their proprietary software and existing DFAS hardware. Since the software is proprietary, JDDA is the only source for these integration services. 

DFAS currently uses EagleVision printers, MADS software, EagleVision Post Print Verification (PPV) equipment and software interfaces supplied by JDDA.  JDDA is the proprietary owner of source code for two critical software pieces of the configuration, EagleVision (controls entire printing process of the EagleVision printer) and MADS (formats all DFAS data files for both checks and documents).  JDDA has specific proprietary interfaces consisting of electronic circuit boards, programmable logic controllers, firmware, and hardware.  Any new hardware must be fully compatible with the existing hardware and proprietary interfaces.

Only JDDA has the knowledge and access to the MADS and EagleVision software necessary to determine hardware compatibility.  No other source can determine the appropriate equipment required or integrate the new hardware and resident operating system into the configuration without specific knowledge of and modification of software code within the system.  The combined efforts of DFAS, JDDA, and the equipment manufacturers created the current printing/inserting system. JDDA in conjunction with DFAS and the manufacturer of the new customized equipment will ensure that the configuration meets all necessary specifications.  The equipment purchased is not standard commercial off the shelf (COTS) equipment, rather it is customized hardware configured jointly by DFAS, JDDA, and the manufacturer. JDDA is the proprietary owner of the MADS software that integrates the various components of this system. JDDA recommends the appropriate hardware, based on least impact to existing system, in terms of required modifications and overall cost.    


6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition    This is a sole source requirement, for reasons stated in paragraph 5 above.  No other source is capable of satisfying this requirement. The notice of intent to award on a sole source basis will be posted to FedBizOpps prior to award.
 In accordance with OUSD memorandum, Public Disclosure of Justification and Approval (J&A) Documents for Non-Competitive Contracts dated February 13, 2009, this J&A will be posted to FedBizOpps within 14 days of contract award.  

7.  Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination  
In determining a fair and reasonable price, the Contracting Officer will evaluate a more detailed breakdown from a formal Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The detailed estimate will include specific equipment, the level of effort of individual service items and potential labor categories, as well as estimated labor rates. The estimate, in terms of both equipment and labor will be compared to established pricing on other Government contracts, such as the General Services Administrations (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) for the same equipment and labor categories and/or similar equipment and labor categories. Additionally, price comparisons will also be accomplished from as many other sources as possible, including commercially as well as any other Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC).

8.  Market Research    
For reasons stated in section 5 above, it is the determination of DFAS Standards and Compliance, Tax & Disbursing Functional Area (S & C) that no source, other than JDDA, is capable of serving as the integrator of the new configuration.  However, S&C did research potential equipment replacement possibilities using the internet and placing phone calls for the sole purpose of market research.  Once potential providers were identified, S & C contacted manufacturers representatives to obtain possible equipment that may have the potential of replacing the current equipment.  Equipment currently in use by the U.S. Treasury, Financial Management Service (FMS) was viewed by DFAS Disbursing and considered the capacity to be excessively large, too fast, and the cost too high to be cost efficient or compatible with existing components.

Because of the proprietary nature of the existing system, only JDDA has the knowledge and access to the MADS and EagleVision software necessary to determine hardware compatibility and suitability.  No other source can determine the appropriate equipment required or integrate the new hardware and resident operating system into the configuration without specific knowledge of and modification of software code within the system.    A preliminary assessment by S&C,  shows that the XXX equipment will potentially save between $XXX,XXX and $XXX,XXX over and above other researched equipment, not including costs associated with re-engineering the existing software and hardware interfaces.  In addition the interface re-engineering costs for different equipment would be an additional approximate $XXX,XXX to $XXX,XXX and would take 8 to 13  months additional time, which represents an unacceptable delay given that the age of the current equipment requires replacement before a catastrophic failure puts the DFAS mission at risk.

Ultimately, for reasons established in this section above as well as section 5, it is determined that only JDDA can ultimately determine the appropriate equipment and perform the follow-on service in order to accomplish a successful integration of an updated check printing, AOP printing and inserter configuration.

9.  Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition
The equipment being replaced has an expected useful life of 10 years and has been in continual operation for 13 years.  The equipment is unique and replacement parts can only be found on used equipment as salvage or by custom fabrication.  Additionally, the manufacturer no longer supports the equipment.  The manufacturer of some of the embedded parts in the inserters is out of business and replacement parts do not exist.

The configuration and customized hardware/software integration provided by JDDA is the result of in excess of 20 years of support of the DoD printing Mission.  Providing for a new supplier would also require the replacement of the existing Eagle printers, Post Print Verification, and the MADS software that is not being replaced at this time because of the proprietary nature of the existing equipment.

DFAS prints 1.8 million checks annually that are sent to Federal civilian employees, retirees or their survivors, military members, vendors, and State and Local government agencies.  Of the 1.8 million checks printed, 45% of those checks go to retirees. The consequences of not being able to print checks if the equipment fails, are that we will experience mission failure, and incur penalties and interest payments as dictated by the Prompt Payment Act.  

10.  Interested Sources  To date, no other sources has expressed an interest.

11.  Actions to Increase/Foster Competition  In order to mitigate the Sole Source position, DFAS would need to take one of three actions:

Identify a software developer that can provide a similar product as the solution provided by JDDA and has the expertise to provide hardware, software, and maintenance to two sites (Indy and Columbus) and has the experience in US Treasury checks and payment related document printing in a highly secured Federal Government installation.  

DFAS can create their own software and locate individual equipment suppliers.  The development time associated with providing a total solution would expose DFAS to an increased risk of Mission Failure.

DFAS  can contract with the U.S. Treasury to have them take over the entire printing function.  This option has been researched and rejected by XX. XX because of the reduced service that would be provided to our customers.

None of the above options are viable alternatives at this time.  In considering cost and schedule, it is in DFAS best interests to leverage 20 years of design and development of the current check and AOP configuration.

12.  Other Factors  

When DFAS (at that time the Army Finance Center) was looking for production printing and control software, JDDA was under contract with the U.S. Treasury to provide the type of equipment and software we were looking for.  Theirs was a unique solution due to the volume and security involved with the printing operation.
	
JDDA has been supplying hardware and software for the printing operation for checks and documents at, initially, three locations now consolidated to two sites and specifically for DFAS  in Indianapolis for over 20 years.  DFAS Columbus has recently been added as a full COOP site.
