<RESPDATE>112018
<CONTACT>Christopher C Fisher, Contracting Officer, Phone 2187887242, Email christopher.c.fisher10.mil@mail.mil
<DESC>This is a special notice seeking competition for Blanket Purchase Agreements. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for these requirements; pricing is being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).<br /><br />This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-100. This procurement is subject to a total small business set-aside. The North American Industrial Classification Standard 336413 applies to this solicitation; business size standard is 1250 employees. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to award under a different NAICS, if the company would qualify as a small business under the solicited NAICS.
<p>The Minnesota Air National Guard, 148th Fighter Wing, is in need of a Blanket Purchase Agreement to repair F16 Radar Absorption Panels. A Blanket Purchase Agreement is an agreement between the government and a vendor that allows the 148FW to make "calls" against established terms via a government credit card (GPC). The 148FW anticipates one award for the BPA due to the possible sole source nature of this requirement, and 148FW does not plan to advertise or compete calls against this BPA for the duration. If multiple capable vendors are identified, multiple BPAs will be issued and calls will be competed among BPA holds on a per-call basis.</p>
<p>Any BPA will be valid for a period up to five (5) years, with potential for automatic re-issuance.</p>
<p>The following is needed:</p>
<p>Prices for repair of the following NSNs: <br />1560-01-331-4816<br />6625-01-330-3326<br />6625-01-330-3327<br />6625-01-330-3328<br />1560-01-333-2249<br />6625-01-329-7367<br />5985-01-290-4623<br />5985-01-299-6164<br />5985-01-290-4621<br />*And similar items in the same class</p>
<p>Please note that a BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a streamlined method for acquiring products or services on an as-needed basis from qualified sources that are readily available and thus eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements. Establishment of a BPA does not guarantee calls will be made. There is no minimum guaranteed quantity. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this notice.</p>
<p>The Government may request a site visit with any offeror to establish acceptability. Awarded BPA holders undergo annual visits to ensure standards are met.</p>
<p>****Quotation Instructions****</p>
<p>Multiple solutions to the requirement are encouraged and should be offered as alternative quotes and will be evaluated as separate offers. Innovative solutions are encouraged and will be evaluated in accordance with the intent of this requirement.<br />Quotes resulting from "calls" will be comparatively evaluated in compliance with FAR 13.106-2 (b) (3). Location, pricing, and quality will all be considered.</p>
<p>Lack of active SAM registration will preclude BPA award. All offerors shall include a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Item or complete electronic representations and certifications at: https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM</p>
<p>All questions and quotes must be directed to 148 Contracting Officer via email at usaf.mn.148-fw.list.msc-personnel@mail.mil. Emailed quotes are preferred. Late quotes may be rejected at the Contracting Officer's discretion.</p>
<p>Electronic Documents: All electronic documents must NOT be "secured", "locked", or otherwise inaccessible. Submitter risks rejection if documents prove inhospitable to viewing and evaluation. Utilize standard Microsoft or Adobe formats, and net file size of all documents should be less than 10MB.</p>
