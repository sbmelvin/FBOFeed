<DESC><p>Description
<p>50 CONS/LGCZH is hereby issuing this presolicitation notice for the Space Innovation and Development Center (SIDC)&nbsp;for continued support to the Aerospace Fusion Center (AFC) Operations and Maintenance Support and other in-scope Research &amp; Development efforts.&nbsp; A previous sources sought synopsis was issued for this effort on 22 Jan 08, and there was only one interested party who submitted a capability brief.&nbsp; This company was the incumbent, Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems (NGES), 1100 West Hollyvale Street, Azusa, California 91702, which is currently performing this effort under the Rapid Prototyping, Integration, and Development (RaPID) Contract, FA2550-04-C-3008. The Government intends on awarding a sole-source contract to NGES for the continued support.&nbsp; The current AFC contractual coverage ends on 30 Sep 2008 and is being performed on a sole-source basis. To maintain continuity for future AFC requirements, a basic year of contract support with four one-year options for this continued support is anticipated. The requirement consists of seamlessly extending support for AFC and its customers by supporting the center's operational software, the Space Awareness and Global Exploitation (SAGE) system, the Static Infrared Emitter (SIRE) processor, SAGE client displays, and affiliated hardware, software, crypto, and communications lines. This also involves using SAGE to analyze events in both real-time and playback mode; integrating and tuning of advanced Overhead Non-Imaging InfraRed (ONIR) fusion algorithms in SAGE; providing operational performance assessment; incorporating mission performance improvements on SAGE; and system administration functions. Although the facility is staffed on a 5-day per week, 8 hour schedule, the SAGE system and SIRE processor operate on a 24/7 basis, and the capability must exist to respond within 2 hours of hardware or software failure. In event of contingencies or schedule conflicts, the AFC can be staffed 24/7 for a limited period of time. The AFC is a development facility located in the Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center (MDIOC) at Schriever AFB CO. The contractor personnel who perform the operations and maintenance portion of the AFC are required to have current Top Secret/Secure Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) security clearances and must qualify for clearance to the appropriate program level. NGES is the manufacturer of the Defense Satellite Program (DSP) sensor and developer of the AFC's software suite which includes the SAGE system, the SIRE processor, the Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) Automatic Track Transfer processor, Missile Defense Agency's (MDA's) External Sensors Lab (ESL) algorithms, New Foreign Launch-Prototype algorithm, and Walker algorithms. In addition, NGES has access to raw satellite data critical to the AFC's functions and dedicated communication lines to deliver that data into the AFC. The contractor must be capable of providing information to the AFC via communication lines at a minimum rate of 9 MB/sec of data transfer. Facilities that replicate the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Mission Control Station (MCS) to include actual SBIRS hardware, software, and real-time data feeds are also required. The contractor must also be able to seamlessly and quickly take over the troubleshooting and development of the SAGE system, the SIRE processor, the HEO Automatic Track Transfer processor, the fusion of classified ONIR data sources in real-time into SAGE, and continue development and support of the MDA's ESL missile defense algorithms for state vector improvement. The contractor must also possess the expertise to fuse all DoD ONIR satellites in SAGE in real-time and be able to perform the operations and maintenance of SAGE servers and client workstations running at the AFC and at the AFC's customer locations. The contractor is also required to have existing supplier and maintenance agreements in-place for all existing AFC hardware to include computer, networking, video and crypto equipment. Additionally, the contractor is required to possess the capability to transmit data in real-time from non-operational DSP satellites, some of which may not be available from the SBIRS MCS. The period of performance for this projected effort is expected to commence on 01 Oct 2008. This contract will transition the AFC effort from the current RaPID Contract, FA2550-04-C-3008, to a contractual vehicle with an estimated annual budgeted value of $14M administered by 50 CONS in conjunction with the SIDC. This announcement shall not be considered a request for offers.&nbsp; Although some subcontracting opportunities may exist for this effort, no portion of this requirement will be set aside for small businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct technical questions to Mr. James Andros, (719) 721-9091 and contractual questions to Mr. Robert Wind, (719) 567-3565.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center, on behalf of the United States Access Board, has the need for hotel rooms and a meeting room with accessibility requirements, audio visual equipment, and Food and Beverage Services in Washington, DC for its 2009 Board Meetings.    

The Access Board is a very small Federal agency with a governing Board of 25 people.  The President appoints thirteen members of the Board for four year terms.  By law 6 of these Public members must be people with disabilities.  There are 12 Federal members designated by statute.  These are assistant secretaries from major Federal agencies such as the Department of Justice, Department of Transportation, Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services and the General Services Administration.  The Board meets five times a year in Washington, DC.  It needs hotel meeting space and sleeping rooms for about 14 Board members from outside of Washington.  The meeting dates are set in the Boards regulations, and can only be changed with the consent of the Board under extreme circumstances.

2009 Access Board Meeting Dates - The Access Board needs to book a hotel for its meetings in 2009.  The meeting dates will be forthcoming.

Hotel Requirements -- The Access Board requires a hotel that has availability on the meeting dates and can provide:

1.	Meeting Room.  A meeting room of approximately 1300 to 2000 square feet which will accommodate a U shaped meeting table seating approximately 25 people.  There must be room for additional seating of approximately 30 people around the perimeter of the room.  

2.	Audio Visual Equipment.  The Board will require the following items of equipment for audio visual support of all of its meetings; 
a.	computer projector, 
b.	speaker phone, 
c.	projection screen, 
d.	sound mixer
e.	speakers 
f.	Approximately 25 table microphones.  

3.	Food and Beverage Service.  The Board desires to provide a continental breakfast, coffee service throughout the mornings, on the three meeting days.  The Board will have two buffet luncheon meetings. The food service will be for 40 people.  

4.	Sleeping Rooms.  The Board will need a total of 14 sleeping rooms for a period beginning the night before the scheduled meeting, and ending on the night of the last meeting.  Within the 14 rooms the Board requires a total of 6 wheelchair accessible rooms.  Of those 6 rooms, 3 rooms must be equipped with a roll-in shower, and 3 must be equipped with a bath tub with grab bars.  One of the rooms with a roll-in shower must have a door to an adjoining room (That adjoining room does not have to be accessible.)  The wheelchair accessible rooms must meet the ADA accessibility standards as closely as possible.  The ADA Accessibility Standards are located at the following web address:  http://www.ada.gov/reg3a.html#Anchor-11482


Locations and Access Requirements -- The Access Board has developed explicit guidelines for choosing a hotel for its meetings.  These are:

1.	The hotel, its public areas, meeting rooms, sleeping rooms, and public restrooms, must meet, as closely as possible, the current ADA accessibility Standards.  In addition, the hotel must have done an excellent job of integrating the access into the general design of the hotel.  For example, there cannot be a separate entrance that is accessible for people with disabilities but rarely used by people without disabilities.  Access Board staff will make a determination whether the hotel most closely meets the standards. 
2.	The hotel must have sleeping rooms that are accessible to people who are deaf, or the hotel must have the required portable equipment. 
3.	The hotel should be in the central business district of Washington, DC. 
4.	The hotel should be within 3 blocks of a METRO station. 
5.	The hotel should offer government per diem rates or be reasonably priced. 

The Access Board staff must be able to make a site visit to the hotel to determine whether or not it meets the accessibility criteria, design criteria, and other requirements. 

Consistency in Hotels -- The Board has found that it is easier to meet consistently in one or two hotels in the DC area.  

The Government reserves the right to make a single or multiple awards.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS), paragraph 3.2.2.4, the FAA intends to award a contract for 100 SunFire V240 servers.  The server specifications are as follows:	2x1.5GHz UltraSPARC IIIi processors w/1MB L2 cache	2GB RAM	2x73GB drives	Dual power supplies	DVD-ROM	XVR-100 Graphics	4xIntegrated 10/100/1000BaseT Ethernet	Rail Kit
 The Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) system is designed to optimize traffic flow to runways at the 20 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs).  The goal of TMA is to develop a coordinated sequence and schedule for aircraft and display this plan to air traffic controllers.  TMA calculates arrival schedules in real time based on flight plans, wind data, and information entered by air traffic management coordinators and controllers.  With TMA, air traffic management coordinators can even out traffic flow using separation strategies such as spacing and sequencing aircraft for arrival, and determining optimal departure times.
 The TMA system uses Sun Blade 1500 workstations for GUI displays and backup servers.  Given the high failure rate of the Sun Blade 1500 and the unavailability of spares, the FAA wants to acquire the SunFire V240 servers to replace 90 of the TMA backup servers.  This will return 90 Sun Blade 1500s to spare inventory, and also place 10 additional Sunfire V240 servers in spare inventory.
 It is estimated that an award may be made within 15 days from this notice.  Any inquiries should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Mario Maccarone, via e-mail at mario.maccarone@faa.gov or via phone at 609-485-6740.  All inquiries must be received by 7/16/08 at 12 noon.

This procurement is to extend Contract NAS5-02032 for a period of up to 8-months from August 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009 andincrease the maximum ordering value in order to allow sufficient time to award thefollow-on procurement. The ITCD is currently working to refine their requirements in order to go forward withthe most efficient and effective set of requirements for the follow-on to the currentTelecommunications Maintenance and Operations Support Services contract. This extensionwill allow for a continuation of current delivery orders issued, for modifications toexisting delivery orders, and for new work until the Telecommunications Maintenance andOperations Support Services follow-on contract is awarded. The contract extension andmaximum ordering value increase are necessary in order to ensure program continuity andcritical mission support and to avoid significant technical and programmatic impacts toGSFC. The current contractor provides the following highly specialized mission criticalservices to NASA's GSFC ITCD: Responsibility for the continued day-to-day operation andmaintenance support for the interconnect telecommunications system (ITS) which consistsof six (6) Siemens Hicom 300 H Version 1 System Communications Servers, Phonemail,Automatic Call Distribution (ACD), Interactive Voice Response(IVR) System, Hicom DomainManagement System (HDMS) Modular, Information Management System (Comsoft), and theUninterruptible Power System (UPS); relocating existing equipment; performing newinstallations; providing new system design, testing and documentation, cable plant, andmaintenance of ITS related data bases at the Greenbelt, MD site.

Due tothe time and substantial duplication of costs involved in procuring and phasing inanother contractor, Siemens is considered the only contractor capable of meeting NASA'sGSFC needs given the short period of performance for the extension. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 PM. local time onJuly 26, 2008.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Optical Technology Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Newport Corporation, Spectra-Physics Laser Division, for the purchase of an Upgrade S-X which will be installed in an existing Matisse Laser System.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST currently utilizes a Matisse Laser system.  This purchase is for upgrading this existing laser system made by Spectra-Physics.  The upgrade consists of modifying the laser system so that it reduces the current frequency bandwidth of the output light to 20 percent or less of its current value.  The laser is a system that requires 100 percent compatibility of all its subsystems to guarantee operation that meets its performance specifications.  Newport Corporation is the only vendor capable of providing the required upgrade in order to satisfy the Governments minimum requirements.  Newport Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by July 25, 2008, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Introduction:The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation, has a requirement for the discovery, characterization, and preclinical testing of new adjuvant candidates based upon triggering of the human innate immune system. High throughput screening of libraries of natural and/or synthetic compounds will be used to fulfill the requirement for novel adjuvant candidates. Funding under the prior RFPs is NOT required for the current solicitation; ALL qualified offerors are invited to apply. 
Description: For the purpose of this BAA, adjuvants are defined as molecules that act via innate immune receptors to activate beneficial innate and/or adaptive (T and B cell-mediated) immune responses. The adjuvant products targeted in this program may be developed as components of antigen specific vaccines against infectious disease, or may serve as stand-alone agents that transiently prevent or treat infectious disease. Among the best characterized innate immune receptors are members of the Toll-like Receptor (TLR) family of proteins that participate in recognition of structures such as bacterial cell wall components, including lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharides; bacterial DNA sequences that contain unmethylated CpG motifs; and virus double stranded RNA. In addition to TLR, innate immune receptors include complement receptors; scavenger receptors such as CD36; C-type lectin-like receptors such as mannose-binding proteins, dectin-1, and DC-SIGN; and intracellular receptors such as the RIG-like helicases RIG-1 and MDA5, and NOD-like receptors such as NOD1/2, IPAF, and NALP3. To aid in designing safe and effective new adjuvants, this program will support the application and improvement of analytical tools for the discovery of new adjuvant candidates, the in-depth functional analysis of adjuvant-triggered responses on the cellular and molecular levels, in vitro testing with human cells or tissue, and in vivo testing in animals to assess efficacy and feasibility for further development that is beyond the scope of this program. Currently, only one adjuvant is licensed in the U.S. for general human use, aluminum hydroxide/aluminum phosphate, and it has failed to provide optimal immunostimulatory activity for a number of vaccine candidates. Therefore, new adjuvants are needed to induce robust immunity and to direct the most effective type of response, e.g., antibody production or cytotoxic T cell induction. No single adjuvant will be sufficient for all vaccine applications and it is expected that important new adjuvant candidates will emerge from adjuvant discovery research. Furthermore, in addition to their use for specific vaccine applications, adjuvants targeting innate immune receptors might be useful as stand-alone immunotherapeutic agents for the short term prevention or treatment of infectious disease. 
It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a five-year period of performance beginning on or about July 2009. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows:  7.35 FTEs per annum per contract. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This BAA will be available electronically on/about July 31, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS) Great Lakes Inventory and Monitoring Network (GLKN) is collecting tissue samples from fish in water bodies at six national parks across the Great Lakes region to monitor trends in targeted contaminants.  This is a three-year pilot project that may lead to full implantation as part of a long-term ecological monitoring program for nine national parks in the upper Midwest.
NPS scientists and contractors will collect, process, and freeze (@ -20 0F) the edible fillets of northern pike (Esox lucius), grass pickerel (Esox americanus), walleye (Sander vitreus), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) from selected study lakes.  The species being collected will depend on availability at each lake.
Laboratory analyses will be done on composite samples of axial muscle tissue of the sampled fish. The composite sample will contain equal masses of tissue from 8 individual fish of a single species. A composite sample will be analyzed for either 9 or 18 water bodies during each year of sampling. We will create a duplicate composite sample for either one or two of the study sites for quality assurance purposes, yielding a total of either 10 or 20 composite samples per year.  The exact sample size will depend on per sample costs and availability of funds.

<RESPDATE>072508
<CONTACT>Gregory Joseph Dougherty, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone (407) 380-8419, Email Gregory.Dougherty@navy.mil
<DESC>The Center for Naval Engineering Learning Site (CNELS) Naval Station Pearl Harbor (NSPH) is a complex, interrelated series of independent and dependent systems consisting of fuel, deluge, smoke abatement and city water supply.  The recent effort to modernize the site has significantly altered the basis for the logic that the existing Facility Control System (Delta V) uses to provide a human  system interface with the CNELS facility.  Due to the obsolescence of the existing hardware/software configuration, there is an immediate need to upgrade the facilities control system to accommodate the new fire fighting training device currently being built at CNELS NSPH.  The new training device will not utilize the current JP-5 fuel configuration but will incorporate propane gas to fuel fires.  This change from JP-5 fuel to propane is another modification that needs to be incorporated into the new hardware/software facilities control system.

Considering budget, schedule and user familiarity (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)m substantial duplication of costs not recoverable in competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements), the Government has determined that an upgrade to the existing system is preferred over design and procurement of a new system.  Based on information available, the Government believes that the OEM of DELTA V, CALTROL, INC, is the only responsible source capable of providing the upgrade.

NAWCTSD Orlando plans to negotiate and award, on a sole source basis, a facility control upgrade contract with CALTROL, INC.  This is not a request for proposals.  Any firm that contests CALTROL, INC as the sole responsible source capable of providing an upgrade to the existing DELTA V system should contact the POC by the closing date of this announcement.

<a href="mailto:miller.debbie@epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) in Washington, DC intends to issue a sole-source twelve (12) month contract extension for the existing environmental monitoring network called Clean AirStatus and Trends Network (CASNET) with MacTec of Gainesville, Florida, on contract number 68-D-03-052, that expires on July 29, 2008, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This contract currently has 84 monitoring stations in 32 states, which provides electronic quality and meteorological data to the EPA on a daily basis, consolidates and submit data from sites operated by the NPS (National Park Service), and archive and manage over 100 million data records representing all data collected by the CASTNET program since 1987 in a central database for analysis and reporting.  In addition, this contract requires quality assurance and quality control data to the EPA that are necessary for documenting bias and precision of network instruments and protocols, instrument calibrations, quality assurance checks, data coding, and documentation of procedures and protocols; purchase and testing of all sample media and supplies; analysis of all samples; laboratory quality control samples, blanks, calibration standards, filter production-lot acceptance testing and performance evaluation samples; laboratory data entry; and storage and archival of all sample extracts and filter media. Support also covers data management, analysis, storage, validation; and equipment repair and maintenance.  MacTec is the only responsible source to continue to satisfy the Government's requirement of monitoring the CASNET system to avoid any disruption in operation of the network that would seriously impair the Agency's ability to characterize trends in deposition levels and atmospheric concentrations of air pollutants and their precursors for 2008 and years to come. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA)  contain specific statutory language requiring the monitoring and data supplied by CASTNET for program assessment.  CASTNET tracks real-world environmental results over time and space as emission reductions take place. Since atmospheric changes occur very slowly and trends are often obscured by the wide variability of measurements and climate, numerous years of continuous and consistent data are required to overcome this variability.  Furthermore, a disruption in service would be cost prohibitive for the EPA to shut down and secure the monitoring stations. Any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying the EPA's requirements on July 30, 2008, without any disruption in the operation of the CASNET network and to the integrity of the data at no additional cost to the Government, may submit a written request within 15 days of this announcement to Nicole Schuller, Contracting Officer, at schuller.nicole@epa.gov.  The estimated value of this twelve month extension is $5.5 million. The EPA is working to issue this contract competitively and a Request For Proposal is expected to be released on or before August 1, 2008, for the implementation of a new contract to satisfy the CASTNET program.  A determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.  The NAICS Code is 336999 and the Small Business size standard is 500 employees.  This sole source announcement constitutes the only solicitation. A written solicitation will not be issued.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order on a competitive basis. The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has a requirement to purchase crane rental services for 3 months.  The Statement of Work is as follows:  Introduction This Statement of Work requires the provision of heavy lift services to support U. S. Department of Transportation (US DOT) testing of loaded semi and double axle commercial trailers in Hanna, Alberta and the surrounding area. Requirement Provide a minimum 60-ton capacity crane with operator and one rigger to safely lift commercial trailers during US DOT testing.  The full scale testing will be quasi-static (no tractor attached).  The commercial trailers will weigh between 25,000 and 50,000lbs when fully loaded.  The crane must be capable of lifting either one end or side of the trailer to an angle of 40 degrees measured with the ground (maximum height approximately 30 feet).  In order to lift the trailer smoothly and prevent it from twisting when being raised and lowered, the crane must be equipped with two and four point bridles.

When requested, the contractor shall provide a minimum 10,000 lb capacity forklift to assist with loading trailers.  The rigger provided with the crane will be required to operate the forklift.  Schedule The crane operator and rigger will be required to work eight to twelve hour days Monday through Sunday onsite to support US DOT engineers in this activity.  Testing is expected to take place over maximum seven consecutive days, weather permitting.  The number of test locations will be kept to a minimum to reduce travel time and expenses for equipment and personnel. The Volpe Center will provide at least three (3) days notice before services are required. Deliverables When requested provide minimum 60-ton capacity mobile crane with operator and experienced rigger and 10,000 lb capacity forklift to support Volpe Center testing activities in the Hanna, Alberta Canada area.

1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.

2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.  Submit the following:  
	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D.	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof	of insurance.

The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  
5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  
6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.	b.    is illegally present in the United States.c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.

Offerors shall submit past performance and experience information. The offeror must provide the information requested for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offerors submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offerors.  Past performance information shall demonstrates how well the Offeror satisfied its customers on previous contracts and shall  include name(s) for points of contact, telephone numbers, email address, contract number (if any), contract price, period of performance, years performed and any unique qualities of the contract.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a brand name notice. The required item for this posting is renewal of Media Encryption Software (Formerly known as Disknet Pro/Point Sec Protector) that the government intends to purchase as a brand name award under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(c), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, Application for Brand Name Descriptions. No award will be issued from responses to this notice. This notice is solely for seeking information and does not legally bind the government in any manner.
<p>United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires the renewal of Media Encryption Software (Formerly known as Disknet Pro/Point Sec Protector) for USSOCOM Computer Security. Interested parties may e-mail joseph.sherwood@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, Joseph Sherwood, not later than Friday 18 July 2008; 10:00 a.m. EST.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>Media Encryption (Point Sec Protector) software provides USSOCOM Headquarters enterprise and local visibility of compliance with established network security policy. The software reveals how security policy is actually applied on the operational network. By highlighting systems and users that do not comply, command attention and resources may then be focused on strengthening the network security posture through better policy enforcement. Media Encryption (Point Sec Protector) will also provide information that will identify issues that are inadequately addressed by existing policy. Finally, due to its ability to monitor removable media at a highly granular level, Media Encryption (Point Sec Protector) allows USSOCOM to:<br />&bull; mitigate the risk necessitated by operational requirements <br />&bull; provide an enterprise-wide solution with a policy driven mechanism of securing information<br />&bull; provide an automated capability to ensure data integrity across the enterprise<br />&bull; provide a central control of access to removable media, as well user access to floppy disk, CD/DVD ROM, Zip/Jazz drives, memory sticks, PDA and flash memory allowing all removable media/IO devices to be authorized before use is granted and for authorization to be centrally managed or authorized with Active Directory group management<br />&bull; provide a profile based file management capability to prevent users from creating defined file types on local workstation and or network drives<br />&bull; provide device management through administrative control of user access to all PC ports (USB, IrDa, Com, Firewire.LPT)<br />&bull; provide detailed auditing capability <br />&bull; provide tracking of user behavior and system security<br />&bull; automatically detects and integrate with compatible anti-virus scanners<br />&bull; ensure data can only be accessed by authorized personnel, on authorized systems<br />&bull; provide enterprise and local visibility of compliance with established network security policy <br />&bull; provide the automated capability to identify issues not captured by existing policy<br />&bull; provide capability to mitigate the risk necessitated by operational requirements<br />&bull; provide an automated application verification and audit analysis capability</p>
<p>&bull; provide visibility into enterprise operations and potential security threats<br />&bull; provide a capability to build security analysis into existing policy and automate event response<br />&bull; provide capability to identify and prioritize potential network vulnerabilities<br />&bull; provide a common policy definition for network operation among enterprise stakeholders</p>
<p>USSOCOM believes award for another product would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The approximate cost of the duplication effort would be $166,217.00 and includes resources for testing and operational readiness (certification and accreditation, operational compatibility and continuity) with the current network architecture and the risk associated to downtime and lack of coverage during a replacement phase of new technology. These costs are based on expenditures under the current contract that have been incurred to gain a level of operational acceptance by the government for contractors and government employees and would not be recovered through open competition.</p>

<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies, however, there will be no 45 day period for responses. The response dead line will be the response date for this posting, 16 July 08.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>USSOCOM believes award to any other source would result in substantial cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Good Mobile Defense is a deployed capability supporting the wireless technology and devices at multiple USSOCOM-enterprise locations. Although this technology will soon be replaced by new technology to be released late 2008 by DoD, USSOCOM has a requirement to sustain security controls on these devices until replaced with the new technology. The cost of implementing new technology and trying to disperse it across the enterprise would not be feasible or cost effective for the amount of time required to maintain this license agreement. Accordingly, Good Technology, Inc. is the only firm capable of providing the maintenance without the government experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Distribution Center (DDC) is considering whether or not to set-aside an acquisition for small business and is seeking qualified small business sources that qualify under North American Classification System (NAICS) code 493110, size standard $23.5M. This sources sought notice does not constitute a request for a formal proposal or a presolicitation notice. This notice is provided as information to the marketplace and is an invitation for an expression of interest and a DEMONSTRATION OF CAPABILITIES to perform anticipated work. Furthermore, the DDC is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept any unsolicited proposals. As a minimum, this Request for Information (RFI) requires a technical capability sufficient to provide warehousing and distribution services at the Defense Distribution Depot Guam (DDGM). This contract will be a follow-on contract for distribution and warehousing operations in the territory of Guam currently being performed under DDC Contract SP3100-04-C-0012.  This work will include basic distribution functions. DDGM provides customer support and material management through compliance with the Distribution Standard System (DSS) automated warehouse management system requirements and by incorporating expanded distribution expertise to enable forward positioning of Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) wholesale assets in order to support the anticipated growth of mission requirements in Guam.   A rough order of magnitude for workload projection is 100,000 receipts, issues and trans-shipments per year or an operation approximately the size of the Defense Distribution Center, Barstow, California (DDBC). DDGM performs the full scope of physical distribution functions typically performed at a DLA managed distribution center. The functions include receipt, issue, inventory, and trans-shipment service of retail and wholesale replenishment receipts. The center provides direct-turn-over and off-island trans-shipments, storage and care of stock in storage (COSIS), issue of retail and wholesale material, packing, shipping and local delivery. The physical distribution operations are government owned and contractor operated (GOCO). Contract oversight and responsibility will be the responsibility of the DDGM Continuing Government Activity (CGA). The general scope of proposed contract actions are to include but are not limited to the following: (1) Provide receiving, storing, inventorying, issuing, packaging, trans-shipmenting and performing Special Projects; and (2) Provide all labor, material and supplies, Material Handling Equipment (MHE), and Garrison Mobile Equipment (GME) maintenance, to perform the distribution requirements. The performance period is for 1 year with a possibility of 4 one year options. Full performance is expected to begin on or about 23 July 2009. There will be a 3 month transition period, which will ensue just prior to full performance. This requirement is to be performed at the Defense Distribution Depot Guam (DDGM)located on the Naval Main Base, an 8,000-acre parcel which is part of the Navy Apra Harbor Complex. Naval Base is located 8 miles southwest of Hagatna, the capitol of Guam and 11 miles southwest of Won Pat International Airport. Andersen Air Force Base, located 20 miles northeast of Naval Base, is Headquarters to the 13th Air Force and 36th Air Base Wing. Andersen AFB provides military passenger and air cargo services to and from Guam. The Center is strategically located at the boundary between the Pacific Ocean and Philippines Sea approximately 3,300 miles west of Hawaii, 1,400 miles southwest of Japan and 1,250 miles east of the Philippines. The Navy regional commander is Commander U.S. Naval Forces Marianas (COMNAVMAR) who is also U. S. Pacific Command (PACOM) Regional Coordinator and PACOM representative for Guam, Commonwealth of Northern Marianas Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. Serving as a stock point for DLA and service owned material, DDGM supports both local and worldwide customers. With an inventory value in excess of $21.5M, approximately 17,000 lines, the Depot can provide immediate support to both industrial and war fighting customers. Direct support is provided for the various ships home-ported in the Pacific Southwest, including submarine tenders, submarines, and supply ships, in addition to transiting Carrier Strike Groups (CSG), Expeditionary Strike Groups (ESG), other Naval ships, forward deployed Air Force, Marine Corps and Army units. DDGM is an integral partner with COMNAVMAR in creating a one-stop supply and logistics service delivery capability in which afloat and ashore customers can obtain individualized, customized, and flexible logistic services. The primary customers of COMNAVMAR are a Submarine Tender, the Military Sealift Command and 3 T-AO vessels that provide support to ships operating in and transiting through the Pacific. The DDGM operation supports the current COMNAVMAR customer base, while broadening the scope to include an increased level of support to Air Force, Army, and Marine Corps end users, and ships and other mobile units operating in and transiting through the Pacific theater. Additionally, DDGM will be structured to support potential increases in future distribution requirements for Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps customers operating in the defined geographic support area. Interested, responsible small business sources that qualify under the above listed NAICS code are required to submit a capability statement of no more than three (3) pages that identifies and assesses your company's ability to satisfy these requirements.  The capability statement must address: 1) Knowledge of DDC warehouse and distribution operations and special functions or similar type operations; and 2) Knowledge of and experience in the Distribution Standard System (DSS). Any such response must also include: (1) A positive statement of your intention to submit a proposal for any subsequent solicitation as a prime contractor; (2) Evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope described above to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact, and telephone numbers; and (3) Past performance references with points of contact and telephone numbers. At least 2 references are requested, but more are desirable. A response is required by 22 February 2008 at 4:00pm EST. At the present time, a set-aside determination has not yet been made. This notice is for informational and market research purposes only. Interested parties shall include their business size as well as any applicable preference program in their response. Responses are being sought from small business sources that have a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of warehousing and distribution services. Small businesses may team together or may even team with large businesses, and remain eligible to participate in a set-aside acquisition. However, vendors are reminded that should this acquisition become a Small Business Set-Aside, the clause at FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996), will apply and would require that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern. The above requested information must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made regarding a Small Business set-aside.  Failure to submit all of the information requested may result in an unrestricted acquisition. This synopsis does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website http://www.fbo.gov/.  It is the responsibility of potential respondents to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this potential requirement. The information provided in this sources sought synopsis should not be construed as a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. Respondents are advised that the DDC will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this sources sought notice. Reponses to this notice must be received electronically.  Paper media will not be accepted or opened. An email response should be sent to tracy.birch@dla.mil. Questions should also be referred to Ms. Tracy Birch at (717)770-6613. Please be advised that all information received in response to this notice will be considered procurement sensitive and will be handled accordingly; however, any information that the contractor considers to be proprietary pursuant to existing laws and regulations must be marked accordingly (FAR 3.104-1(3)&(4).

<CONTACT>David A Borne, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-6603, Fax (301) 757-6552, Email david.borne1@navy.mil
<DESC>In the FY2010 to FY2012 time frame, the Government intends to begin procurement of wide field-of-view (WFOV) night vision goggles/devices for aviation applications in Navy and USMC fixed and rotary wing aircraft.  This RFI is designed to aid in the market survey of current and future technologies that can meet the requirements of a WFOV Night Visions Device (NVD).  

Background: Over the past 20 years night vision devices have become standard equipment in Navy/USMC rotary wing and TACAIR aircraft.  Today all Navy and USMC night vision equipped aircraft fly with the AN/AVS-9 night vision goggle (commonly referred to as the ANVIS-9).  This night vision goggle (NVG) has a forty (40) degree field of view which limits the ability of the aircrew to view an operational environment without significant head movement known as the NVG head scan.   The NVG head scan can be tiring and fixation on one area of the scan can result in a loss of situational awareness of the scene outside of the 40 degree NVG field of view.  For these reasons the Navy aviation fleet has developed a requirement to identify available technologies to support fielding of a night vision device that significantly exceeds the current 40 degree field of view.  During the past decade the Army has performed several research projects comparing pilot performance with night vision field of view.  The general conclusion was that a field of view beyond the current 40 degree field-of-view resulted in an increase in performance that was somewhat linear through approximately 70  80 degrees field-of-view (i.e., as field of view increased, so did pilot performance).  Beyond 80 degrees field-of-view the performance continued to increase, but not at as significant a rate as it did between 40 and 70 degrees.  

It is the procurement goal of this future Navy program to field a WFOV night vision device to all of the current and future NVG compatible Navy/USMC rotary wing and TACAIR aircraft.  Although performance tradeoffs are expected, the technical goal for this program includes no significant degradation in NVG performance from our current AN/AVS-9 NVGs (resolution, gain, signal-to-noise, eyebox, weight, etc.) while at the same time significantly expanding the field of view.  Technologies are not limited to image intensifier tube technology night vision goggles.

It is a further technical goal of the Navy to maintain a peak 40 degree vertical field-of-view but technologies that result in a vertical field-of-view as low as 30 degrees will be considered.  The technology must increase horizontal field of view to at least 50 degrees with 70  80 degrees being a mid-range goal and beyond 80 degrees being a long range goal of the program.


This RFI represents the current description of the users requirements and is being published in order that the Government may establish early communications with industry for a future acquisition and solicit comments and questions prior to development of a future RFP. We encourage and welcome all detailed comments, questions and written correspondence concerning the clarity, completeness and competitiveness of the RFI. 

There is no prescribed format for the response to this RFI. Responses to this RFI should consist of a discussion, in broad terms, of 1) the commercially available approach(es) which could be used or updated to meet the Navys requirement; 2) a rough estimate of the price of each approach; 3) a discussion of the extent of research and development (technology risks, schedule, cost) required to mature the product to a point where it could be produced in quantity;  4) a discussion of any potential participation by small, HUB Zone small, small disadvantaged, or woman-owned small business concerns; and 5) a statement as to whether the firm responding to the RFI is a small business. 

It is requested that any written responses to this RFI be submitted no later than 4:00 P.M. (Local Time, Patuxent River, MD) on 11 September 2008.  All responses to this RFI shall be submitted to: ATTN: David Borne Naval Air Systems Command, AIR 2.4.2.2.3, BLDG 2272, Suite 350 47123 Buse Rd.  Patuxent River, MD 20670.  For information concerning this RFI contact David Borne at david.borne1@navy.mil. Response should include a company point of contact. Responses received after this date may or may not be considered in determining whether to issue a Request for Proposal. Small, HUB Zone small, small disadvantaged, and woman-owned small business concerns are encouraged to submit responses to this RFI.

<DESC>The United States Army, Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle
Management Command in support of the Armament, Research, Development, and 
Engineering Center (ARDEC) intends to solicit, negotiate, and award on a sole-source basis to SOSSEC, Inc., 24 Center Street, Newburyport, MA  01950, acting as an agent on behalf of the members of the Systems of Systems Security 
(SOSSEC) Consortium.


The government has a need to team with industry, academic, and nonprofit partners through establishment of an Other Transactions agreement with a Homeland Defense consortium. Through the proposed agreement, the Governments primary objective is to collaborate with a consortium to perform a coordinated research and development program designed to develop prototype technologies advancing Homeland Defense (HLD), Homeland Security (HLS), Emergency Management, Force Protection, and Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) missions.  


A consortium comprised of educational, nonprofit, and commercial organizations and with broad and open membership is required to provide the Government a partner able to collaborate across barriers that include military/civilian, public/private, local/regional/national, and political/jurisdictional concerns.  The objective consortium should be open to new membership and display a broad array of expertise, experience, and multi-regional awareness connected to HLD related technologies and applications.  


Under the proposed agreement, the Government and non-government members of SOSSEC, Inc. shall perform coordinated planning and research and development prototype efforts designed to encompass the following mission areas for HLD and related technologies: (i) Prototype Research and Development, (ii) Technology Development, Evaluation, and Transition, (iii) Technology Integration, (iv) Training and Exercise Support, and (v) Awareness and Demonstration.  


Consortium members are expected to provide input on a wide array of expertise, including investigation into tactics, techniques and procedures, evaluating new and existing products for emerging operations (including situation awareness, Non-Lethal Systems, biometrics, and rapid prototyping), providing training opportunities for local, state and federal HLD responders, and conducting periodic demonstrations of selected technologies.


The resulting collaboration and prototype development will have a direct Government benefit in improving joint military and civilian capabilities in such critical areas as communications and collaboration, technology maturation and demonstration, and preparedness training support.  


A formal written solicitation is not planned.  

Any responsible/interested sources shall submit their qualifications and capabilities within fifteen (15) business days of this notice to: Commander, US Army JM&L LCMC, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, ATTN: AMSML-AQ-SP, Ms. Courtney-Lynn Barnes, Bldg. 322,  Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000 or submit the information electronically to the email address shown.  Information submitted should include your organization, personnel, facilities, applicable subcontractor network and past experience to meet specific needs stated above. Include company name, address, telephone number, technical point of contact, item nomenclature, item description, and brochure/literature. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION. Please be advised that the Government will not pay for  any information submitted under this announcement. Electronic submittals are preferred.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) INTERNATIONAL ICE PATROL (IIP) GROTON, CT.  This is a Request For Information (RFI) as part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the USCGs need to augment the IIP for airborne iceberg reconnaissance over the Atlantic Ocean near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.  The Contractor would provide the aircraft, sensors and ice observers. 

The IIP mission is to monitor iceberg danger near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and provide the limits of all known ice to the maritime community.  Currently, IIP uses USCG 1500 series HC-130 aircraft to conduct airborne iceberg reconnaissance.  Iceberg observations are made by IIP using Forward Airborne Radar (FLAR) and Side Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) supplemented by visual observations by trained ice observers.

The iceberg reconnaissance requires the detection and identification of all significant ice targets and vessels in the search area.  The search area would be determined by Commander, IIP.  For icebergs, a significant ice target is defined as an iceberg 15 meters in length and 5 meters in height above water or larger.  For vessels, a significant vessel is defined as vessel with a length of 10 meters or greater.  Detailed identification of vessels is not required.  The location of all targets detected in the search area must be fixed and recorded to an accuracy of +/- 250 meters or better. In addition, the position of the aircraft must be recorded a minimum of once per minute with a positional accuracy of +/- 250 meters. 

The Contractors aircraft must be fitted with a radar or other remote sensing system(s) that permit the conduct of reconnaissance in low or no visibility conditions.  The radar and/or other sensors must be able to detect small icebergs and distinguish between vessels and icebergs in sea conditions up to 3 meters (significant wave height).  If the radar and/or other sensors are unable to distinguish between vessels and icebergs, identification may be accomplished by descending to obtain visual confirmation.

Information on the flight track and the location, identity, and time of all detected targets must be placed in a computer-readable MANICE format as prescribed in the Manual of Standard Procedures for Observing and Reporting Ice Conditions (latest revision) to be transmitted electronically to the IIP Operations Center.  The manual is available at the Environment Canada web page http://ice-glaces.ec.gc.ca/WsvPageDsp.cfm?ID=172&Lang=eng.  The flight report shall be transmitted electronically to and received by the IIP Operations Center within two hours of the landing of the reconnaissance airplane.

The Contractors aircraft must be certified under U. S. Federal Aviation Regulations Part 135, Commuter and On-Demand Operations or equivalent. In addition, the aircraft service provider must be inspected and approved by the U.S. Department of the Interiors Office of Aircraft Services (OAS) or by a civilian inspection service that uses OAS-like standards.

Capability statements in response to this RFI shall include the following:  (1) a description of the aircraft proposed to conduct the reconnaissance, including speed, endurance, and operating altitude, and personnel capacity; (2) description of the radar and/or other sensors that will be used to conduct the reconnaissance, including information on the capability of the systems to detect iceberg and vessel targets in the size range described herein, and the ability to distinguish between these targets for lateral ranges up to 30 nautical miles from the aircraft; (3) a description of the company history with regard to (a) companys experience conducting reconnaissance; (b) accepted commercial practices for contract pricing; (4) Since the contractor will be providing the aircraft, sensors, and ice observers, list all costs (estimated) associated with providing the required reconnaissance services; (5) personnel qualifications of pilots, navigators, remote sensing system operators and ice observers; and (6) If a civilian inspection service is being utilized, certify whether or not OAS-like standards are being applied.  The Government requests that no proprietary information be provided in response to this request for information.  INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE REVIEWED BY INDIVIDUALS FROM THE USCG AND FROM POTOMAC MANAGEMENT GROUP, INC., ALEXANDRIA, VA.  

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the capability statements received.  No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  Please limit electronic response to no more than ten pages.  Responses to this market survey shall be sent directly to: Helen.R.Nelson@uscg.mil with a copy to Barbara.J.Lis@uscg.mil.  Only electronic responses will be accepted and shall be submitted no later than 11 August 2008.  For the purpose of business size determination, assume the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this RFI is 481219.  With regard to the NAICS Code, please identify if you are a large or small business in your response.  PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED AND MESSAGES LEFT WILL NOT BE RETURNED.

The competition will include those services that are currently performed in Silver Spring, MD and Rockville, MD.  Services being competed include general analytical and administrative support activities. Typical functions to be performed include document and correspondence preparation, communications, meeting support, budget support, inventory, office automation, FOI support, public health support, timekeeping, device safety, office support and special projects.

No solicitation exists at this time. The solicitation will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities if and when it is released. The projected end date is on or before November 30, 2008.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, NO SOLICITATION SHOULD BE ANTICIPATED, AND PROPOSALS ARE THEREFORE NOT REQUESTED

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), for the National Institute of Biomedical
 Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) intends to negotiate and award a contract on a 
sole source noncompetitive basis to the Radiological Society of North America, 820 
Jorie Boulevard, Oak Brook, IL 60523-2251, for continuous effort developing of the 
RadLex Ontology, a medical imaging web-based information resource. 
  

Background / Objectives / Scope of Work
 
The purpose of the RadLex project is to unify terms and concepts for indexing and retrieving a variety of imaging information sources, such as imaging research databases, educational materials, and clinical imaging reports. RadLex is sponsored by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), which has enlisted the collaboration of 26 other radiology professional and standards organizations, including the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the Digital Imaging and Communications (DICOM) standards committee of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), to develop a comprehensive radiology lexicon.  

This requirement supports Phase II of the project, which continues the development of the RadLex Ontology, a rich knowledge base of interconnected radiology concepts from the list of RadLex terms created by the relevant RadLex subspecialty committees.  When complete, the RadLex Ontology will be capable of describing all the salient aspects of an imaging examination, including modality, technique, visual features, anatomy, findings, and pathology.  The RadLex Ontology will be available for use by a wide variety of software tools and web-based information resources, including RSNAs Medical Image Resource Center (MIRC) and the National Cancer Institutes cancer biomedical informatics grid (caBIG) project.

Imaging researchers have traditionally used ad hoc methods to organize their film-based image libraries.  Now that it is possible to store biomedical images on line in digital form, there is a pressing need for a unified, organized source of concepts and terms to index and search these databases.  A well-indexed online biomedical image database becomes a sustainable resource that investigators can use to find the biomedical images they need for subsequent research. 

The most likely candidates for such a source of imaging concepts and terms would be general medical terminologies.  However, the most complete terminology systems for general medicine, such as SNOMED-CT (College of American Pathologists, Northfield, Illinois), are missing terms for up to 50 percent of the concepts found in radiology reports [2, 3].  Initial work on the RadLex project has shown that between 10 and 30 percent of RadLex anatomic terms are not contained in SNOMED-CT (unpublished data).  Because no existing terminology provides a complete set of terms and concepts to index biomedical images, it remains difficult to retrieve images based on their biomedical content.  Instead, the retrieval of biomedical image subsets from research databases often requires manual search through associated radiology reports, case report forms, or the images themselves, in order to obtain image sets that can be re-used by researchers.

In addition, a Procedures and Protocols, or Playbook project committee has begun working on terms to describe the devices, procedures, and systematic protocols that are used to acquire and process biomedical images.
Imaging researchers have normally used the ACR Index (American College of Radiology) or ad hoc methods to organize their film-based image libraries.  However, the ACR Index embeds semantics in its numeric identifiers, and contains only a few thousand termsappropriate for a manually administered image archive, but insufficient for online image repositories that can be indexed and searched automatically by investigators.  Unlike the ACR Index, RadLex is designed for use in software applications. 
RadLex also will unify and supplement imaging terms in other lexicons, such as SNOMED-CT (College of American Pathologists, Northfield, Illinois), the Unified Medical Language System (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland), and DICOM (National Electrical Manufacturers Association, Rosslyn, Virginia).  The resulting lexicon will be freely available on the Internet with cross references to these other lexicons and standards.
This project provides support for the continuing RSNA-NIBIB RadLex Ontology Project, the goal of which is to create a rich ontology for medical imaging research.  Achievement of the following specific goals will be the final result of work on this project:
1)	A rich ontology of relevant organ system domain concepts, freely available as comma separated variable (CSV), ontology web language (OWL), and Protg files
2)	Documentation of the structure and content of the ontology
3)	Linkage from concepts in the RadLex ontology to SNOMED-CT concepts, UMLS unique identifiers, and terms in the ACR Index
4)	A documented, reproducible methodology for converting imaging term lists to rich ontologies
5)	Software that demonstrates the ability to: 
a)	assign concepts from the RadLex ontology as image meta-data in research databases, and
b)	retrieves images from research databases using queries based on image meta-data.

As an independent contractor and not as a Government employee or representative, the RSNA will perform the following tasks in support of this project.  These tasks are representative of work RSNA has performed in similar lexicon development pilot projects and may change as the RSNA-NIBIB project develops.  The need for changes and modifications will be discussed by RSNA in the periodic reports described below (Management Plan/Deliverables).  During the performance of this contract, the domains to be converted to the RadLex ontology include but are not limited to neuroradiology, cardiovascular, abdominal, pediatric, and thoracic.  Other organ system domains may be identified for development in lieu of or in addition to those in this initial plan, as directed by the Project Officer, based on a change of scientific direction or a shift in priorities.
1) Enhancement of conversion software- Existing software developed during the pilot project will continue to be evaluated, improved and refined during the current project. 2)  Design of information mode; 3) Ontology creation and synthesis; 4) Review and revision by clinical experts; 5) Harmonization and linkage with related terminologies; and 6) Dissemination.
Following the completion of the RadLex Procedures and Protocols term ontology, RadLex will be aggressively promoted to RSNA members at the RSNA annual.

The reference number for this notice is NHLBI-PB (BB)-2008-158-RCO.

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation and the resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26 (June 12, 2008).

The period of performance is for a twelve (12) month base year, plus four (4) twelve (12) month option years from the date of award.

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541690 and the associated small business size standard is $ 6.5 Million. 
 
Through the acceptance of an unsolicited proposal submitted by the Radiological 
Society of North America was awarded a contract to conduct a pilot project titled as 
RSNA-NIBIB RadLex Ontology Pilot Project (RFP 1406-04-06 RP-63438) by
The Department of the Interior National Business Center, through GovWorks, Federal 
Acquisition Center from 2006-2007.  The pilot project was successfully completed, and 
the pilot RadLex Ontology was widely disseminated and adopted.

In order to maintain the continuity of the methodologies gained through the award resulting from the acceptance of the unsolicited proposal for storing/retrieving biomedical images on-line in digital form, an award to any other source for this follow-on contract would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which could not be recovered through competition.   

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The resulting acquisition will be entered into pursuant to the acquisition authority set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.   Responses to this notice will be reviewed in accordance with the following criteria: 

(1) Understanding of the Requirement and Technical Approach; (2) 
Qualifications and Availability of Personnel; (3) Management Plan; (4) Past Performance.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Contractor SHALL perform the following tasks:<br />1)	Project Reports: Reports detailing activities conducted and preliminary results will be provided to the CINMS in fall 2006.  <br />2)	Data: Contractor shall provide data from SEA stations to a database accessible to CINMS.<br /> 3)  Conduct a graduate seminar in ocean observatory data analysis and visualization     <br /> at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  <br /> 4)   Produce with a comparative process among the participants in the graduate      <br /> seminar, a data analysis, visualization and communication product that displays  <br /> the data collected with the ADCP ocean observing instruments and which can be  <br /> exported to web-based platforms including, but not limited to SIMoN. <br /> 5)  Develop exportable visualization tools. ONMS, in coordination with other  <br />NOAA and NOS offices, has been deploying ocean observing assets for several years across the Pacific Coast of the United States.  To date, this activity has amounted to deploying environmental monitoring instrumentation. CINMS and ONMS now need to develop tools and products to analyze, display and communicate the results of this monitoring to sanctuary managers, NOAA administration and the public.  Communicating this information is complex as the monitoring data are of high dimensionality (X-Y location, time, depth, U&amp;V current direction and magnitude, etc.), and simple solutions are not at hand and require creative technical development.  Therefore, the xx component of this project is to conduct a graduate seminar with a framework to competitively develop a data analysis and visualization tool that can be exported in diverse web-based platforms including, but not limited to the Sanctuary Integrated Monitoring Network (SIMoN).<br />This project builds upon an array of oceanographic instruments placed around the Channel Islands to track the movement of water masses.  The existing array is operated by scientists with the University of California's Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), which has installed an oceanographic instrument array at the islands of Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel, as well as additional arrays along the mainland coast.  As such, PISCO scientists and technicians are uniquely qualified to maintain the six CINMS stations, they have an existing database of information that CINMS data can augment, making the information from CINMS stations a part of a larger oceanographic picture.  <br />The government intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract with period of performance of six months from date of award.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. Questions concerning this acquisition must be directed to Maria Mendoza by email at maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov.  This is a small purchase action estimated value of less than $100,000.00.  ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003.

This sole source contract is for management consultant/process improvement services for the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) investor assistance program.

The contractor will work with OIEA employees to provide assistance with regard to process design, process reengineering, and business modeling.  The work will be performed by Christian Casturo.  Christian Casturo of Point Management Group, Inc. will:  1) Work with OIEA project and program management staff to document key current OIEA business processes, then recommend and implement private sector best practices for processes and program management in OIEA; (2) Improve the implementation tracking of project management and process improvement initiatives; (3) Create staffing models to determine OIEAs contact management/ case capacity; (4) Analyze and make recommendations on how to improve outcomes of investor contacts for responsiveness to consumer complaints; (5) Assess existing correspondence for appropriateness and responsiveness, identifying areas of weakness of training opportunities and suggesting changes to canned language and/or policies; and (6) Communicate project status regularly to senior management, including findings and recommendations.  The period of performance will be approximately 24 hours per week for 12-13 weeks.  

The SEC intends to negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with the National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare Inc. on a sole source basis, to consolidate learnings from various initiatives and to build urgency within the mental health delivery system for the need to embrace performance improvement technologies and approaches.  The period of performance will be September 30, 2008  September 29, 2009.  The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  This procurement is under the Simplified Acquisition threshold and will be awarded as a Simplified Acquisition.    

The recent IOM report, Improving the Quality of Health Care for Mental and Substance-Use Conditions: Quality Chasm Series, found that the quality improvement infrastructure for mental health and substance use is significantly underdeveloped compared to general health care.  The application of quality improvement methods at the site of mental health and substance use treatment and support is rare and most providers have little training or experience with quality improvement efforts. Additionally, although there is talk about outcomes and performance, few understand the value of measurement and even fewer give priority to establishing effective systems that monitor key decision-making variables.

Additionally CMHS has contracts in place with NIATx and the Mental Health Corporations of America (MHCA) to test performance improvement initiatives.

Building on this work, CMHS will now work with the National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare to work across these and other initiatives to consolidate learnings from these various initiatives and to build urgency within the mental health delivery system for the need to embrace performance improvement technologies and approaches.

The National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare (NCCBH) represents the nations community mental health centers  mental health and addictions treatment providers with a community mission to provide care to all who need it, regardless of their ability to pay.  Their 1,400 plus member organizations provide safety-net services to 6 million children, adults, and families in communities across this country.  
NCCBH is the only national organization that represents all of these providers, it has direct access to the provider community, and, as a result of its activities, is in a unique position to provide the requested information expeditiously to SAMHSA.  Having NCCBH provide information on these important issues will save CMHS time and personnel resources. SAMHSA does not have the access to this population of providers and would otherwise need to expend considerably more time and money collecting this information directly. 

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as articulated above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document is available.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability statements should be submitted by 11 am July 28, 2008 to keith.austin@psc.hhs.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with the National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare Inc. on a sole source basis, to help train psychiatrists with a curriculum designed to develop and enhance the effectiveness of community psychiatrists in public sector policy and service settings.  The period of performance will be September 30, 2008  September 29, 2009.  The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  This procurement is under the Simplified Acquisition threshold and will be awarded as a Simplified Acquisition.    

The psychiatric workforce of today receives minimal training in the realities of community-based, recovery-oriented practice. Psychiatric residency training continues to be primarily inpatient-focused when the majority of adults with serious mental illness and children with serious emotional disorders and families can and are being served in community settings. Recovery, evidence-based practices in community settings, quality improvement processes, leadership and management of empowered teams of clinical and paraprofessional specialists, collaboration across human service systems and knowledge and understanding of public sector financing are covered only briefly, if at all, in psychiatric residency programs.   As a consequence, promising young psychiatrists are often overwhelmed and disillusioned when faced with the challenges of practice and leadership in the public sector. 

Through a previous purchase order, CMHS tasked the National Council with developing a curriculum for community psychiatrists that is designed to develop and enhance the effectiveness of community psychiatrists in public sector policy and service settings. The curriculum builds on the existing knowledge and practice in established government, university and business leadership development programs.  The curriculum presents a series of didactic, case based, mentorship, and skills-based interventions over the course of year.  Participants meet regularly with fellow participants, as mentors, and project directors, both in person, and online in order to maximize the acquisition of new skills, as well as opportunities for application.

An initial group of psychiatrists are now being trained in this curriculum and participating in the mentoring and leadership offerings presented by the Contractor.
All of the psychiatrists enrolled in the program voluntarily applied and all program participants work in a community-based mental health and/or substance abuse setting and have the support of their employer. Participation in the program does not exceed one year and is structured to allow enrollees to continue in their current position with the employer granting limited time for participation in the project.
This contract supports the recruitment and training for a second cohort of 12 psychiatrists to participate in the year-long training program.

This project builds upon an existing effort that was initiated by SAMHSA. NCCBH solely qualifies to continue this work through the existing curriculum developed in phase 1 and the ability to access this particular group on providers. This project is solely accomplishable through NCCBH and the unique position it maintains in the provider community. They have proprietary rights in the use of the baseline data related to this project and are the sole entity that can perform the scope of this contract. 

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise, qualifications, and experience to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Governments requirement as articulated above.

<p>1.0 OBJECTIVE:<br />The Office of the Secretary of Defense's (OSD) Program Decision Memorandum (PDM) III directs and funds USSTRATCOM to incorporate distributive enhancements to existing Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) capabilities. Under this direction, the NPES Net-Centric Migration project will provide the ability to access NPES and the NPES data and data services in near-real time across multiple geographically dispersed nodes on secret through SCI enclaves. Existing (NC2) application data access components will be combined and adapted to seamlessly support node failures, disruptions in network connectivity, interruptions in service, low bandwidth environments, etc. This effort will also ensure the suitability of this enhancement for Global Command and Control systems (GC2) such as the Strategic Knowledge Integration Web (SKIWeb) and the Data Federation and Synchronization (DF&amp;S) effort. <br />The contractor shall provide software engineering and/or software specialist support to J86. Personnel under this task, with other NPES and DF&amp;S teammates, will help define and engineer the architecture and implementation focused on NPES application suite enhancements and integration. The NPES application suite will be improved, as required, using a layered architecture approach that exploits the capabilities and positions for future NC2 Integration efforts. <br />2.0 TASKS:<br />The contractor shall assign personnel to these tasks that have experience with requirements analysis, software and systems engineering, integration, and an understanding of the relationship between operational, technical, and systems architecture, all being essential. Contractor personnel shall have significant background experience and thorough working knowledge of the current NPES data architecture, the NPES application, the relationship to the war fighter capability, and a demonstrated in-depth knowledge of the NPES suite and its current architecture. <br />2.1 Participate in NPES and DF&amp;S working meetings, technical exchange meetings and design reviews to provide technical recommendations for the NPES Net-Centric architecture to support integration of applications (and in particular, the NPES applications) into the NC2 infrastructure.<br />2.2 Analyze and develop strategies, design patterns, and best practices for the integration of the NPES applications into the NC2 environment supporting redeployment and migration to the SIPRNET, TS Collateral, and Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS).<br />2.3 Develop a high-level implementation plan that describes the activities, scope, and resources required to migrate NPES to DF&amp;S on the SIPRNET, TS Collateral, and JWICS.<br />2.4 Develop a high-level conceptual and use-case document that describes and supports NPES report information.<br />3.0 DELIVERABLES:<br />The results of the tasks described above will be captured in appropriate white papers/documents. As a minimum, this shall include: <br />3.1 Appropriate paragraphs/sections within the NPES Net Centric Migration Plan - e.g., detailed description of the software application, allocation of components to layers, Applications Program Interface (APIs) between levels, data architecture, detailed design &amp; implementation patterns, etc.<br />3.2 Lessons Learned document that identifies constraints imposed on applications (in particular, the NPES suite of applications) by the NC2 and DF&amp;S architecture, implementation strategies/approaches, preliminary analysis/prep work required of any application that migrates to this infrastructure, etc.<br />3.3 An NPES implementation plan with a relative schedule detailing the steps, actions necessary, and the resources required to improve the NPES application to utilize this enhanced NC2 architecture and data tier.<br />4.0 PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS:<br />Engineers assigned to this task must be intimately familiar with NPES software architecture, especially data structures, data access, and how data is processed and used within NPES. Familiarity with modern layered architecture methodologies and design patterns is highly desirable. Personnel must be able to support a rapid prototyping and integration activity, and work effectively in a team environment with government architects, BEA/Oracle consultants, other application integrators, etc.<br />5.0 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:<br />USSTRATCOM, Offutt AFB, NE, Bldg. 500<br />6.0 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br />1 Aug 08 to 1 Oct 09 (follow-on effort anticipated for future phase tasks)<br />7.0 SECURITY LEVEL:<br />Up to TS/SCI</p>

<p>N. Participants shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS with quote.<br />O. EVALUATION FACTORS:<br />The Government intends to make a single award to the responsive and responsible firm whose quote is most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price related factors considered. The Technical evaluation factors are Technical and Management Plan and Past Performance. Technical and Management Plan is more important than Past Performance. When combined these technical evaluation factors are more important than price. As the technical evaluation of quotes approaches equality, greater will be the importance of price in making the award determination. In the event that two or more quotes are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced quote. It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted. <br />Awards may also be made on the basis of initial quotes without discussions. <br />Quoters are therefore cautioned that each initial quote should contain the quoter?s best terms. <br />Technical and Management Plan: The technical and management plan shall identify the organizational structure, staffing, operating procedures, and employee benefits of the firm. The plan shall also include the technical approach to successfully provide these services ensuring no lapse in staffing. The plan shall include an entry and exit transition plan. The Plan should be simple, easy to read and clearly describes contractor responsibilities, any proposed subcontracting arrangements and communication and coordination plans with the Government. The technical and management plan shall also include the firms contingency and continuity of operations plans in the event of natural or manmade disasters that may disrupt service capabilities. <br />Past Performance: The quoter shall identify three (3) contracts/orders that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance. Recent is defined as within the last three (3) years. Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity and magnitude to the work identified in the SOW. Please include the following information: a) Project Title; b) Description of the Project; c) Contract/Task Order Number; d) Contract/Task Order Amount; e) Government; f) Agency/Organization; g) COTR?s name, address, phone number and email address; h) Contracting Officer?s name, address, telephone number and email address; i) Current status, e.g. completed and/or in progress, start and estimated completion dates; j) A brief narrative of why your firm believes this reference is relevant to the proposed task.<br />Price: The price quote shall include the following: Fully burdened on-site hourly rates for each proposed labor category for the base period and for each option period. Department of Labor Wage Determination No: 05-2103 is incorporated into this solicitation. <br />The technical quote submission shall be limited to 10 one-sided pages (inclusive of cover pages, charts, graphs, tabs, etc.).

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation forVISN 23 On Site Applications Training for CT, MRI and Nuclear Medicine Imaging Equipment(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items and FAR 13.106 Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation., as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The reference/solicitation number is VA-263-08-RQ-0310 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate written request for quotations will not be issued. This combined synopsis/solicitation will result in a purchase order. (ii)   This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Parts 12, 13 and 15.  Responses to this Request for Quotation are not offers from which an award can be made.  Instead, to establish a contract, the Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) must make an offer that can be accepted by the contractor.  The contractor can accept the governments offer by (1) a signed written acceptance of the governments offer or (2) by substantial performance incompliance with the contract. (iii)  The provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24.  Provisions and clauses incorporated by reference have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulations supplement (VAAR) can be accessed on the Internet at http://www.arnet.gov/far (FAR) and http://vaww.appc1.va.gov/oamm/vaar (VAAR).  (iv)  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611710 (size standards in number of employees is 100) applies to this solicitation.  (v) This requirement consists of one (1) line items:  Line Item 0001: On Site application training for CT, MRI and Nuclear Medicine. Qty: 1;  (vi) The Department of Veteran Affairs has the need for a VISN 23 Imaging service line single trainer for each modality to work side by side with the technologists, to ensure that software and protocols are utilized correctly. (vii) Delivery and acceptance of deliverables shall be FOB destination within 30 days of receipt of order to VA Medical Center, One Veterans Drive, Minneapolis, MN 55417; the training will take place at all VISN 23 locations. VISN 23 has installed sophisticated CT equipment at all sites. And, seven MRIs are either installed or are in the process of being installed. While formal training is absolutely necessary for fundamental knowledge of physics, imaging algorithms, software and protocols; the application of these fundamentals must occur at the work site in the actual workflow. On-site training and real time verification of competencies of each and every technologist is essential to ensure that all technologists are properly trained. An improperly trained technologist can expose a patient to more radiation than necessary. And, not using the correct protocols can provide less than accurate studies which could allow a condition to be misdiagnosed or totally missed. Patient safety is of primary concern. Operator error caused by an improperly or inadequately trained technologist must never occur.VISN 23 Imaging service line is requesting a single trainer for all sites for each modality to work side by side with the technologists, to ensure that software and protocols are utilized correctly. Also a single trainer helps us to maintain continuity by standardizing    exams across all sites in VISN 23.It is expected that there will be continuous application training as upgrades and software enhancements are available. It important that the application specialists are Philips trained and have on going access to current upgrades and enhancements. While other organizations may provide "training", they emphasize anatomy and cannot fully educate an end user on operation of a very complex proprietary product. Terminology, "button-ology" are vendor specific.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Biodex Medical Systems, Inc., Shirley, New York for the following:  Biodex  System 4 Pro Orthopedic Testing & Rehabiliation System, Model #850-000;  Dynamometer and CDS220 Voltage Required including 835-210-A000 System 4 CDS Cart, 900-860 System 4 Dynamometer, 835-130-K900 Trolley Assembly, 850-000-E3000 Dell Tower PC, C13033 Touch Screen Monitor Assembly, 86-339 HP Desk-Jet Printer, 850-109 System 4 Pro Software and Firmware, 850-110 North American Power Cord; Research Tool Kit, #830-108 and all shipping and handling charges.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(b)(1).  The cited authority is applicable because Biodex is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  Muscle strength testing is an integral component of the physical assessment undertaken within the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA).  We have captured data for more than two decades using a dynamometer that accurately assesses lower extremity muscle strength.  Unfortunately, our equipment has become less reliable requiring frequent calibrations and adjustments.  Data generated is also more variable and less consistent.  A sole source for equipment replacement is justified on the basis of the longitudinal nature of our study and the need to maintain continuity with the prior dynamometer-derived data.  The Biodex equipment is the only one that will provide data comparable to current equipment.   Delivery will be within 30 days after receipt of order.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest priced, technically acceptable source.

<RESPDATE>072808
<CONTACT>Diane P. Taylor, Contract Specialist, Phone 2022081822, Email diane.taylor@gsa.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number GS00V08PDC0133 is being issued as a Request for Proposal.   The General Services Administration (GSA), Office of Management Services is issuing this Request for Proposal (RFP) to solicit full and open on a competitive basis.    The requirement is to provide software license review associated with Federal Procurement Data System  Next Generation (FPDS-NG). 
 
1. BACKGROUND

The of Federal Procurement Data System - Next Generation (FPDS-NG) is the federal governments centralized data base that collects summary information for all contracts over $3,000.  It also provides reporting functions for the government and citizens.  More information abut FPDS-NG can be found at https.fpds.gov 

The current contract expires in FY 2010.  Rather than simply award one contract to support FPDS, we plan to award a Service Integrator contract that will assist in migrating the collection of nine systems that make up the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) portfolio into a target architecture that is based on a collection of business services supporting the federal governments acquisition process.  More information about IAE can be found at www.acquisition.gov.  However, unlike traditional Service/System Integrator Contracts, while we expect them to manage the code base and requirements for new functions, we will not allow the Service Integrator to develop new software.  New software will be developed under contracts competitively awarded by the government.  Initially, the Service Integrator will focus on continuing to operate FPDS but over time their responsibilities for other IAE systems will be expanded.  The government intends to make the current FPDS software available to vendors who express an interest in bidding on packages of change requests and to those vendors who obtain contracts.  The current FPDS system will form the basis of the new capability managed by the Service Integrator.  The current system is a combination of commercial packages, e.g. Informatica for reporting and custom Java software that includes open source.  The purpose of this task is to ensure that the FPDS-NG does not have any intellectual property violations.

2. TASK

The contractor shall review the software licenses associated with FPDS-NG and (1) determine if all licenses are clear of any infringements and/or restrictions; (2) determine that there are not duplicative license; and (3) identify license version.  The final report shall identify all licenses reviewed and the findings for each.

3. DELIVERABLES

The draft report shall be provided in Microsoft Word Format five weeks after award.  The government will have 5 days to review and comment.  Final report will be due 6 weeks after award.  All deliverables shall be delivered to the GSA IAE, 2011 Crystal Drive, Suite 911, Crystal City, VA

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(2) DoD is unable to receive a payment request or provide acceptance in electronic form;

Question:  "Is there any particular reason for solicitation SB1341-08-RQ-0366, that you require a scanning mirror rather than a built in scanner, which has higher throughput than a mirror and without the angle/optical effects of a moving mirror?

Answer:  "We will consider this technology as long as it offers live two-dimensional imaging at any center frequency within the range of the instrument, as well as live unfiltered two-dimensional imaging."

The response date deadline is extended to 3:00 p.m. on Friday, July 18, 2008.

All other terms and conditions of the original solicitation remain unchanged.

They may or may not be filled with concrete; we have a mix of tiles.<BR><BR>-I have asked a couple of CISCO suppliers of mine to provide me info/pricing on a part number listed in your SOW<BR><BR>Cisco 1000Base-SX GE SFP<BR><BR>I am getting the same replies back that they cannot find this part number, and they are requesting more of a description of the item, is there any way you can help me out in time for me to turn in my quote on time today?<BR><BR>Cisco P/N GLC-SX-MM  (Cisco P/N)<BR><BR>-The solicitation mentions extra labor to get around the carpet. Could you please elaborate further on this?<BR><BR>It just means that the glued carpet tiles do not align with the raised floor.  Therefore, it may take a little bit more effort to move the floor tiles.<BR><BR>-Are you looking to put any of the cabling in panduit or conduit under the floor? If so this could raise the cost.<BR><BR>None for under the floor.  Wire management as previously described only.<BR><BR>-Do require us to turn up the Cisco switch?<BR><BR>No<BR> <BR>-Do you currently have cable management under the floor?<BR><BR> No<BR> <BR>-Do you require cable management under the floor?<BR><BR> Yes.  This was previously described.<BR> <BR>-Are the current runs of power and data separated?<BR><BR> Yes<BR> <BR>The Panduit conduit or duct you're talking about- is it the ORANGE corrugated??  <BR><BR>-If so, and you may only need 100feet, I guess I can quote the Carlon orange innerduct 2'... is that right?  Plenum or Riser?<BR>Maybe your folks are saying this but it's really the white plastic raceway which protects cables running up walls, or do they really need innerduct.<BR> <BR>We are only talking about the white or almond colored plastic conduit that is normally used to hide wiring in office spaces.  Nothing special.<BR><BR>-What is meant by the carpet not meeting the edges of the tile, additional labor needed?<BR><BR> Duplicate question.<BR><BR>-Do the cables need to be in panduit under the raised floor or can they    <BR> be tied to unistrut supports?<BR><BR>Underfloor wire management was previously described using J hooks.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.  

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful and a failed transition.

OTI's strategic objectives are based on the premise that fast, direct, and overt political development assistance is needed as a catalyst to move countries beyond crisis to stability. When a crisis occurs in a priority country, OTI has the ability to engage in that country and initiate a country program. A country program is designed to address the fundamental constraints prohibiting the country from emerging from crisis. 

USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. The typical OTI country strategy follows US Government policy and directly involves: reshaping hard-line attitudes and perceptions; promoting democracy, human rights, and basic freedoms; disseminating objective information; and effecting positive political change -- wherever and whenever possible.

OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society, development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation, identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs, and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/.

INTRODUCTION

In November 2007, USAID/OTI launched a new program in Pakistans Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is focusing efforts to bring security and development to FATA, demonstrating a new commitment to the FATA through the creation of the FATA Secretariat (FS), and more recently the FATA Development Authority (FDA), to attract investment to the region. In 2007, the FS produced the FATA Sustainable Development Plan (SDP) through which the GOP intends to bring sustained development to the region. The GOP has pledged a billion dollars to the SDP and is actively soliciting additional funds from donor governments, including the United States. 

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), manages a program called the FATA Transition Initiative (FTI) aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc. In addition, the program is undertaking media development activities and outreach efforts designed to increase the amount of information the FATA communities receive about the Government of Pakistan initiatives and development activities.

The purpose of this contract is to fund a Field Program Manager to support USAID/OTIs FATA Transition Initiative in Pakistan. The Field Program Manager holds a management position primarily responsible for coordinating monitoring, evaluation, and reporting of activities within the overall FTI program. The Field Program Manager position will be responsible for the training and management of the FTI programs monitoring, evaluation and reporting staff and resources and will advise the FTI program on the conceptualization, design and implementation modalities necessary to deploy such in a complex, non-permissive, and highly sensitive political environment. The Field Program Manager should be prepared to direct, manage and personally supervise the work of the individuals and organizations under his/her authority without the benefit of directly visiting FTI grant activity sites within Pakistans Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  

The position is a tandem/ladder position. Applicants may submit applications for more than one position/grade level, but must submit a separate application for each. Applicants will be accepted/denied based on the position to which they applied (e.g., an applicant for the GS-13 position may not be accepted for a GS-12 position/grade level). If hired at the GS-12 equivalent level, the selected employee may be eligible for promotion to the GS-13 equivalent level. Promotion to the GS-13 level is not guaranteed, and may only occur after working a minimum of 12 months at the GS-12 level, and after receiving a recommendation for promotion by the supervisor as part of an excellent performance evaluation.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective of hiring for this position is to support the OTI Pakistan program.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Field Program Manager will work closely with OTI implementing partner organizations in the management of relevant program monitoring, evaluation and reporting resources to devise strategies meant to interpret and use information for the general benefit of improving the tactical, programmatic and strategic impact of FTI. The Field Program Manager must demonstrate problem-solving skills and the ability to implement creative approaches at monitoring and evaluating the FTI programs activities in order to advise the OTI Country Representative and other members of the Senior Management Team of ways to improve the programs activities and modalities.  Due to the rest and recuperation (R&R) schedule, the Field Program Manager can expect to periodically assume, in addition to his/her own duties, the responsibilities of one or both the OTI Deputy Country Representative and the OTI Country Representative. The Field Program Manager must demonstrate professional maturity and ability to effectively represent OTI to the high volume of delegations consistently visiting Pakistan. The Field Program Manager must also demonstrate personal maturity given the pervasive proximity of peers and supervisors in both professional and social settings at all hours of the day.  Because of the likeliness of changes in program direction and implementation, the Field Program Manager must be a highly flexible individual capable of redesigning his/her roles and responsibilities. 

The successful candidate must also be willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success.

The Field Program Manager is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia Middle East Regional Team and will be based in Peshawar, Pakistan. Due to the unpredictable security situation, it is important to note that Pakistan is a non-accompanied post, and movement of USG personnel, including USPSCs, is heavily restricted.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

<DESC>T-1A Trainer Aircraft Modification to Add Combat Systems Officer (CSO) Training Capability
This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements to modify twenty-one T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include an on-board Combat Systems Officer training station for use by United States Air Force (USAF) personnel and generate the associated technical data. The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined.  Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards.  The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.
INSTRUCTIONS:
1.	Below is a document containing a description of CSO requirement and a Contractor Capability Survey which allows you to provide your companys capability.
2.	If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your companys capability in meeting these requirements.  Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities.  If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)
3.	Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research.  Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.
4.	Questions relative to this market research should be addressed to John Webb at (937) 904-4254.



REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTIONT-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability
PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
           We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data. The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010 with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2011.
	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical / engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified as integrated into the T-1 aircraft.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM RECOMPETE  UPDATE
DESCRIPTION:  THE PAST PERFORMANCE VOLUME MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 15 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.  THE REST OF THE PROPOSAL MUST BE RECEIVED BY 1500 EST 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL RFP.
SECTION M, PARAGRAPH 2.1.1 MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATING, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE WAS ADDED TO THE END OF THE PARAGRAPH: THE GOVERNMENT MAY CONSIDER PROVIDING POSITIVE EVALUATION CREDIT FOR EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS, DEPENDING UPON THE BENEFIT TO THE GOVERNMENT.
THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED TO INDUSTRY IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INITIAL DRAFT RFP.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.	  Question:  Table includes 3.2.1.2.2 ATD Data Terminal even though paragraph 3.2.1.2.2 has been deleted in the Final Draft Spec.  It should be deleted in the table as well.  Answer:  Deleted from verification matrix.
2.	  Question:  The System Spec is a new document.  What is expected for verification of this new spec?  Is verification expected for the complete system or just incremental capabilities (e.g. EHF SATCOM)?  May the contractor assume that the GFE Training System being provided by the Government meets the requirements set forth in the System Spec?   Answer: Unless there are some outstanding documented issues addressed in problem reports, DRs, etc., the contractor can assume that the current B-2 TS capabilities meets the requirements of the system spec.   Any new requirement (e.g. EHF SATCOM) levied on a contractor will have to be verified.
3.	  Question:  Please clarify the third paragraph.  There are missing words after "adhere to the requirements in".  "..requirements in Air Force Policy Directive 33-2, Information Protection, and JAFAN 6/3, Protection of Special Access Program (SAP) Information in Information Systems. Answer:  The SOW will be corrected.
4.	  Question:  Section L para 4.2.5 d asks offerors to describe their Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  PIXS list 13 attachments, the last being a Subcontracting Plan and section J likewise calls out this plan as Attachment 13.  However, the list of required attachments to the proposal (Section L page 35, para 8.1) doesn't include the Subcontracting Plan, stopping at the first twelve attachments listed on PIXS.  Is this Plan to be an attachment to the proposal?  Answer:  Will place attachment 13 back in section L 8.1. Verbiage has been corrected.

5.	  Question:  There does not appear to be requirement for Offerors to provide an organizational structure, key personnel identification, or key personnel resumes.  We suggest that the Government needs this information to conduct an informed evaluation of competitor's ability to assemble a competent team to support the required work content.  Answer: Section L has been updated to include these requirements.
6.	  Question:  We suggest that these CLINs as well as all other CPIF items be changed to FFP in order to lower the Government's overall risk. Answer: The Government has an acquisition strategy approved by our senior management. This approval included a contract type of CPIF.  We will not consider a contract type of FFP, as we view contract type as an essential requirement of the acquisition strategy and hence the RFP.
7.	  Question:  The current Section M does not mention the TSC upgrade approach or the relocation plan.   We suggest that these items as well as the costs for these CLINs be evaluated as part of the Source Selection. Answer:  We will not evaluate TSC items but price will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance.
8.	  Question:  The SOW requires RESPONSE TIMES that are inconsistent with the design of the trainers.  For example, the time for the WST is 15 minutes, but the device PIDS shows a set of repair times that are longer:
"3.2.3.2 Maintainability b. The WST maintainability requirements are as follows: The mean on---line corrective maintenance time (MCT) shall be 30 minutes or less and the maximum on---line corrective maintenance time (MMAX CT 0.9) shall be 60 minutes or less. The consumers risk shall be ten percent (10%). These times shall not include supply and administrative downtime. If testing is required after a unit is installed, the time for testing shall be included in the downtime. In determination of these times, all maintenance tasks shall be considered critical."    Suggest that the required times be consistent with the PIDs requirements that the devices were designed and tested to.  Answer: The response time and repair time are two different things. The repair time is defined in the PIDS for each device. The response time in the SOW is defined as "The Contractor shall be on the job and running diagnostics to identify, verify, and diagnose Training System problems/failures within the specified response time of user notification (see table in paragraph 3.4.6.5)."

9.	  Question:   In the answers to industry questions dated 1 April, 2008, the government defines FMC as FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities). Anything less is Partially Mission Capable and would be scored accordingly.  Does the Government intend to update/amend 3.4.6.7 accordingly?  Answer:  This answer provides clarification for the previous PIXS notice - Answers to Industry  Response question #190.  First, there is no PMC requirement in the SOW. There is no Mission Essential Support List (MESL) type listing currently used.  Systems are evaluated/scored on a case-by-case basis.  For example, if the Continuous Training System (CTS) was doing a mission that did not require Radar, and the Radar was bent, it would be mission capable and the SIM could be rated at a 1; however, if it was a radar specific training mission objective, then the radar would be required and the SIM would not be mission capable (NMC).  FMC means that the device is Fully Mission Capable (i.e. ALL of the capabilities).  Anything less than "Mission Capable" would be scored accordingly.
10.	Question:  Suggest the small business goal be based on a percentage of sub contracted value or require a lower percentage of the total contract value. Similar USAF Aircrew Training System programs have a requirement for a lower percentage of total contract value.  Answer:  The percentages are reasonable and will remain as they are in the RFP.
11.	Question:  Will the government please provide contractors with a copy of the SENIOR JERSEY Security Classification Guide (SCG) & Annex B? Answer:  The SCG provides classification guidance.  The SCG does not provide additional security requirements - all the requirements are spelled out in the DD Form 254 and the SOW.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.

In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.

Offerors are strongly encouraged to register to receive notification of upload the RFP at this site and register on the Interested Vendor List (IVL).
