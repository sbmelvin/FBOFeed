<DESC>Description &lt;p&gt; This NASA Research Announcement (NRA) solicits hypothesis-driven space-flight research in Space Biology (SB) to be conducted on ISS. NASA SB experiments have one or more of the following primary goals: 1) to effectively use microgravity and the other characteristics of the space environment to enhance our understanding of basic biological processes; 2) to develop the scientific and technological foundations for a safe, productive human presence in space for extended periods and in preparation for exploration; and 3) to apply this knowledge and technology to improve our nation's competitiveness, education, and the quality of life on Earth. NASA SB experiments will be designed to discover how space flight affects a diverse group of microorganisms, plants, and animals; study the effects of gravity (g) across the g-spectrum, i.e., from micro- to hyper-gravity; and characterize the biological effects of radiation, magnetic fields, and the interaction among species in the unusual environments of space and spacecraft. This solicitation (NRA NNH14ZTT001N), entitled, "Spaceflight Research Opportunities in Space Biology," will be available on or about November 15, 2013. This solicitation will be found by opening the NASA Research Opportunities homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/	  and then linking through the menu listings "Solicitations" to "Open Solicitations." Short (1-5 pages) Step-1 proposals will be due on December 19, 2013 at 5 PM Eastern Time, and invited full-length Step-2 proposals will be due on March 20, 2014 at 5 PM Eastern Time. Proposals must be submitted electronically by an authorized official of the proposing organization. Proposers can use either NSPIRES (see URL above) or Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov	     ) for proposal submission. NASAs selection of research projects will be guided by recommendations of the National Research Councils 2011 Decadal Survey Report, Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New Era (http:www.nap.edu/catalog/13048.html	    ) All categories of U.S. institutions are eligible to submit proposals in response to this NRA. Principal Investigators (PIs) may collaborate with investigators from universities, Federal Government laboratories, the private sector, state and local government laboratories and other countries. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit electronic proposals. Instructions on how to register in NSPIRES will be described in the NRA. Each electronic proposal requires the registration of principal investigators and other participants (e.g. co-investigators). Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information. Questions about this NRA may be addressed to the contacts referenced in the full solicitation document. This is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 6.102 (d)(2).

This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The basis for restricting competition is that procuring hardware that is different from the configuration of the existing equipment would result in a duplication of costs to the Government.  Furthermore, the procurement of different hardware would also result in the Government not being able to support the anticipated future procurement of equipment due to a delay to conduct hardware redevelopment and establishment of new calibration requirements.
   
No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed.  Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Offers must be submitted in the format specified in the solicitation.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to submit offers to the Point of Contact (POC) at NSWC Crane.

<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to procure on a sole-source basis one (1) Rockwell Collins IFMR-6070 Instantaneous Frequency Measurement Receiver Tactical Surveillance System (TSS) with VME DF Processor, Antenna Control Board, and Multi-Function Modules from Rockwell Collins, 3200 East Renner Road, Richardson, Texas 75082.</p>
<p>The basis for the sole source is that Rockwell Collins IFMR-6070 TSS DF System hardware and software is designed specifically to integrate into the existing Rockwell Collins equipment, enhancing the systems performance and providing long-term functionality. The additional expense of finding a suitable alternative replacement, designing and manufacturing necessary replacement parts to adapt the currently used collection assets would not be advantageous to the government and would cause significant replacement expense.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334511 with a size standard of 750 employees. Solicitation number N00178-14-R-3009 is anticipated to be issued by 20 December 2013. The Government reserves the right to award on an all or none basis. A firm fixed price contract is anticipated with an award date on or before 07 February 2014. Interested parties shall contact the Contract Specialist at (540) 653-4376 or arlice.johnson@navy.mil. Please reference N00178-14-R-3009 on any correspondence.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award, firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Offerors may obtain information on registration in the SAM by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov.</p>

<DESC>The installation (previously known as the Concord Naval Weapons Station) is now known as Military Ocean Terminal Concord (MOTCO), which the Department of the Army has taken possession from the Department of the Navy several years ago. The current areas that require Lightning Protection Systems were originally constructed (for the Department of Navy missions) without protection from lightning strikes.  <br>  <br> The current customer desires the installation of Lightning Protection Systems that are to cover the following 4 locations; Classification Yards 1 & 2, Building 177, and the  quote mark R quote mark  Buildings (#'s 1 through 4). These locations are separated from one another and are located on the Tidal Side of the Installation where there is the potential for uncovering Unexploded Ordnance (UXO). This situation will require special circumstances during the construction effort, which will include the employment of UXO Construction Support during all construction activities that break the existing ground surface on the installation.  <br>  <br> The basic approach to the construction of the MOTCO Lightning Protection project will be to erect steel poles with construction of overhead catenaries except at R1-R4 building site.  Here both steel and wood poles are utilized, with and without overhead catenaries and air terminals. The lightning poles will be supported by drilled cast-in-place caisson foundations at all locations with the exception of the  quote mark R quote mark  Buildings location, where it is anticipated that four 16 inch diameter concrete pre-cast piles for each steel pole will be driven 78 feet deep with pile caps. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that Building 177 will require a total of 15 new steel lightning poles, 18 new steel lightning poles for Classification Yard #1, twenty new steel lightning poles for Classification Yard #2, and 8 new steel poles & 6 new wood poles for the  quote mark R quote mark  Buildings. The lightning poles are required to be electrically grounded (via 2 copper clad grounding rods) with the stringing overhead catenaries for 3 sites but without stringing overhead catenary for R1-R4 building site. Trenching for the installation of an underground bare copper counterpoise, and exothermic welding (which will be required at each lightning pole location) will be part of Contractor's responsibility. <br>  <br> Acquisition Information: <br>  <br> This acquisition is proceeding as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This RFP is UNRESTRICTED - Full & Open Competition. <br>  <br> Estimated Cost Range is between $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.  <br>  <br> Period of Performance for Construction:  420 Days <br>  <br> This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: Z2QA NAICS Code: 238290.  The size standard for this code is $14,000,000.  All questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Ryan Bayless, e-mail Ryan.J.Bayless@usace.army.mil.   <br>  <br> It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about December 30, 2013, for downloading at the Government's website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. No paper copies will be issued. The specific date and time will be identified in the solicitation.  <br>  <br> OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS.  <br>  <br> ORDERING SOLICITATION: Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy or CD-ROM format. The solicitation and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on a secure Government website known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) once the RFP is issued.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This Sources Sought Synopsis is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing Web System Discrepancy Reporting (WebSDR) capability for the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Transaction Services. Please review, in this order, the Sources Sought Synopsis, the WebSDR Performance Work Statement (PWS), and the WebSDR Capabilities Matrix spreadsheet.
<p>DLA Transaction Services designs, develops, operates and maintains a centralized value-added suite of online Automated Information Systems (AISs) designed for the processing and storage of logistics data. These AISs are managed through four separate profiles composed of DLA Transaction Services Baseline Services (DBase), DoD Gateway Services (DGate), DoD Data Services (DData) and Electronic Business Services (EBus). DLA Transaction Services is in the process of web enabling and maintaining existing Web-Enabled processes to the maximum extent possible, to empower the users of DLA Transaction Services services, and assist in the minimization of DLA Transaction Services resources to support these services. The Contractor will be responsible for modifying, maintaining and supporting the Web System Discrepancy Reporting (WebSDR) capability. The reporting and capture of SDRs is critical to improving operational efficiencies, improving customer satisfaction and measuring perfect order fulfillment.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded. The Air Force anticipates a twelve-month Period of Performance (POP) on the base contract with possible three (3) or four (4) one-year options. The projected base year period of performance is 7 May 2014 - 6 May 2015. The Air Force anticipates this acquisition will utilize procedures outlined in FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541511, size standard $25,000,000.00. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their SAM. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. Interested contractors shall review, fill-in and return the attached Capabilities Matrix and may also submit a 4-8 page capabilities document. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements. Your statement of capabilities should include the following: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to timothy.hayes.1@us.af.mil and emily.hardy.1@us.af.mil. Statements should be submitted no later than 5 December 2013 at 1:00pm EST. The Government will endeavor to answer any questions interested parties may have. All questions must be submitted in writing to timothy.hayes.1@us.af.mil and emily.hardy.1@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.

DRAFT PERFORMACE WORK STATEMENT:
A.	GENERAL INFORMATION 

Title of Project:  CPAC PMO, PRO Pharmacy Agreement Management Support and Pharmacy Data Analytics
1)	Purpose 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Chief Business Office (CBO),Consolidated Patient Accounts Centers (CPAC),  Payer Relations Office (PRO) is seeking professional services to assist with its efforts to increase Pharmacy Benefit Management company (PBM) and other pharmacy third-party payer compliance with federal statutory and regulatory payment requirements and to assist with the continued development of VA pharmacy network agreements with PBMs and other third-party pharmacy payers (TPPs).   

2)	Background
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Consolidated Patient Accounts Centers (CPAC) has developed a plan to address opportunities for improving revenue cycle business functions, identify new strategies to increase revenue and assist the field facilities in maximizing their revenue stream. PRO has assumed management and development responsibility of outpatient pharmacy agreements with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and other types of third party payers and requires assistance in determining if agreements and rate proposals from PBMs and other third party payers for outpatient pharmacy services meet federal payment requirements.
38 USC 1729 authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to recover and collect reasonable charges from third parties (for example, PBMs and TPPs) for the cost of non-service-connected medical care furnished to insured Veterans. The money collected from PBMs and TPPs help offset the cost of delivering world-class health care services to our nation's Veterans, and is revenue anticipated in the President's budget.
Under regulations published at 38CFR Section 17.101, reasonable charges consist of: 
"	VA's billed charges (that is, the total charges VA submits for the service, less any Plan copayment for which the member is responsible), or 
"	Amount the payer demonstrates it reimburses other providers in the same geographic area for the same services. 
If a third party declines to reimburse VA its billed charges and elects to pay VA as it would pay other providers in the same geographic area, VA has the authority to require the third party submit evidence, including claims data and agreements between the third party and non-government providers, to substantiate that the amount the third party is paying VA is the same as what it is paying non-government providers in the same geographic area. (38 CFR 17.101(a)(4))
The billing methodology VA uses to arrive at its billed charges for pharmacy claims are:       
"	For claims with Dates of Service on and after March 18, 2011, VA billed charges per prescription equals the total amount of the acquisition cost to VA of the drugs, plus a standard administrative charge that is computed annually. The administrative charge is computed based on national VA costs for providing outpatient prescriptions (both overhead costs and dispensing costs). The 2013 administrative charge is $13.18.  
"	For claims with Dates of Service prior to March 18, 2011, VA billed charges per prescription are the standard amount of $51.00. 

Following are several statutory and regulatory references related to payment third-party payer requirements for VA:  

"	38 USC1729 (a)(1)  "Recovery by the United States of the cost of certain care and services" 

"	38 CFR Part 17 "Charges Billed to Third Parties for Prescription Drugs Furnished by VA to a Veteran for a Nonservice-Connected Disability" and Section 17.101 "Collection or recovery by VA for medical care or services provided or furnished to a veteran for a non-service-connected disability," effective date March 18, 2011 (Federal Register October 6, 2010) 

"	38CFR Part 17 "Reimbursement Offsets for Medical Care or Services" and Section 17.106 "VA Collection Rule; Third-Party Payers," effective date July 25, 2011. (Federal Register June 24, 2011)

3)	Performance Objectives  
The Contractor shall provide support as stated to accomplish the deliverables described in this Performance Work Statement (PWS), which will enable VA to increase Pharmacy Benefit Management company (PBM) and other pharmacy third-party payer (TPP) compliance with federal statutory and regulatory payment requirements and to assist with the continued development of VA pharmacy network agreements with PBMs and other third-party pharmacy payers. 
Within this effort, CPAC will use contractor services to increase PBM and other third-party payer compliance with federal third-party payment requirements and identify whether individual PBMs and other third-party payer reimbursements meet federal payment requirements. Contractor shall analyze and report on (1) the language (terms, conditions) and reimbursement methodology in existing, new, and in-progress VA pharmacy network agreements with PBMs and other third-party payers,  (2) VA reimbursement claims data specific to individual PBMs and other third-party payers, (3) VA third-party pharmacy billing and drug pricing data as it compares to commercial industry reimbursement trends, (4) VA pharmacy revenue-related business processes and operational issues that impact VA relationships with PBMs and other third party pharmacy payers.  Contractor shall also (1) perform reimbursement verifications for specific PBMs and third-party payers to determine whether their reimbursements to VA meet federal payment requirements, (2) provide pricing and rate modeling scenarios to assist VA in network agreement negotiations, (3) project revenue impact to VA resulting from specific PBM and third-party payer proposed or implemented changes, and (4) provide additional data analyses related to special projects within the CPAC PMO PRO business objective.   

4)	Scope of Work 
The Contractor shall provide support as requested to accomplish the deliverables described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), except as may otherwise be specified. 
Deliverables will include ad-hoc, short-term analyses as well as overarching, long-term analyses and reports/presentations. They will require a wide range of data analytics spanning simple (single-source data) to complex (multiple-source data). Deliverables will require collection and analysis of information from multiple VA stakeholders and VA cross-functional teams, as well as from external parties including PBMs and TPPs. The contractor shall analyze in the context of the pharmacy industry's past, current, and future states (1) VA third-party pharmacy billing and drug pricing data, (2) VA revenue-related pharmacy operational issues, (3) VA business processes related to its relationships with pharmacy third-party payers, and (4) VA contracts/agreements with pharmacy third-party payers. The contractor shall extract claims data from VA databases and store the claims extract in a secured server. The Contractor shall provide the queries that produced the outputs for the VA in the event a request/dispute/ challenge are received after the contract period that will allow the VA to replicate the studies or analysis.

Since 1965, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has provided nursing home care under contracts or Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA). Throughout this history, the Contract Nursing Home (CNH) program has maintained two (2) cornerstones: same level of patient choice in choosing a nursing home close to the Veteran's home and family; and annual qualitative reviews combined with monthly patient visits/contacts to assure quality of care is provided to Veterans. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) staff is the only Federal Officials charged with regularly visiting Contract (Community) Nursing Homes (CNH). The primary goal of the Contract (Community) Nursing Home (CNH) program is to maintain or restore the veteran to the highest level of health and well-being attainable. It is essential that arrangements for care respond to the Veteran's needs at any given point in time and that a flexible long-term plan be initiated prior to placement. For many, placement will represent an interim period of care pending completion of arrangements to return to their own homes, community residential care facilities, or homes of relatives or friends. Others may need to remain in the skilled nursing home indefinitely. This care shall ensure that the care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum wellbeing of VA beneficiaries (patients). The Skilled Nursing Care Facility shall provide care that ensures the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries (patients) is met. To include, but not limited to, physician visits, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services for VA beneficiaries (patients) will be the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the nursing home receiving the same or comparable level of care. In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.

<DESC>Sources are being sought from the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Multi-Mission Helicopter Program Office (PMA-299) for a company capable of providing a Sonar Cable for the Airborne Low Frequency Sonar (ALFS) system for the MH-60R helicopter. The Sonar Cable is required to support the weight of the Transducer Assembly and allow for signal transmission to and from the Transducer with minimal frictional resistance on the external surfaces. The results of this Sources Sought will be utilized to determine if the required product exists in the marketplace and if any Small Business Set-Aside opportunities exist. All Small Business Set-Aside categories will be considered.
<p>The current ALFS Sonar Cable is approximately 2600 ft. in length. The new cable shall have a linear mass equal to or less than 3.70 lbs. per 100 ft. and of a diameter of 6.70mm +/- 0.05mm. It shall provide the mechanical strength to support an attached load of 177 lbs. above the ocean and an average of 270 lbs. below the ocean surface with an adequate safety margin and shall have a breaking strength no less than 1750 lbs. The cable shall provide torque balanced suspension of the transducer to prevent compass errors due to cable induced transducer rotation. The current system consists of two signal conductors in which the center conductor is used for the primary conductor and the outer shield is used as the second conductor. The capacitance shall be 125 pF per ft. maximum and be capable of withstanding 2500 VRMS. The impedance shall be 50 +/- 3 ohms. The cable shall be capable of meeting all electrical and mechanical requirements when operating in seawater over the temperature range of -40&deg;C to +65&deg;C and shall be capable of meeting non-operational storage requirements of -54&deg;C to +85&deg;. The cable shall not stretch beyond 2.5% of its length when applied with a longitudinal load of up to 382 lbs. The cable shall provide the capability to withstand full operating hydrostatic pressure of up to and including 1,305 psi without a change in characteristics and without water intrusion. The cable shall withstand a minimum bend diameter of 7 inches without a change in specified characteristics or sustaining damage. The cable shall withstand a minimum axial torsion of 0.40&deg; per linear foot and 1.0&deg; per linear foot while subjected to static longitudinal tension of 220 lbs and 500 lbs, respectively, without a change in specified characteristics or sustaining damage. The current sonar cable jacket is made of Hytrel. The components comprising the cable shall resist longitudinal translation relative to the other components as to minimize extensive stretching of the cable jacket leading to excess jacket material or "bunching."</p>
<p>The Navy anticipates contracted efforts would be awarded in early 2015 and would require delivery of the new sonar cable for qualification approximately 12 months after contract award.</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.

<DESC>Special Notice DARPA-SN-14-11: Manufacturing Experimentation and Outreach Two (MENTOR2) Proposers' Day Webinar; <br />PROPOSERS' DAY DATE: December 11, 2013, 9:00 a.m. (EST); <br />REGISTRATION DEADLINE: December 6, 2013, 4:00 p.m. (EST);<br />TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Gill A. Pratt; <br />DARPA/DSO Email: DARPA-SN-14-11@darpa.mil;<br />URL: http://www.darpa.mil/Opportunities/Solicitations/DSO_Solicitations.aspx
<p>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a Proposers' Day Webinar to provide critical information on DARPA's Manufacturing Experimentation and Outreach Two (MENTOR2) program vision, the program objectives, and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary proposal in response to an anticipated Broad Agency Announcement.</p>
<p>DARPA's Manufacturing Experimentation and Outreach Two (MENTOR2) program aims to improve defense readiness by improving the secondary school and post-secondary school education of those who will be called on to utilize, maintain, and adapt high technology systems in low technology environments. MENTOR2 will achieve this goal by developing and demonstrating new teaching tools and materials in the fields of electromechanical design and manufacturing. It is envisioned that project based curricula employing MENTOR2 design and prototyping tools can teach a deeper understanding of high technology systems, and better enable future competence in the maintenance and adaptation of such systems through the manufacture of as-designed components or the design and manufacture of new components.</p>
<p>MENTOR2 will be comprised of four integrated focus areas and will demonstrate a few exemplary projects common to all four parts of the program. Proposals must address all four focus areas.</p>
<p>Focus Area 1 Analysis and Simulation Tools - Methods and tools developed under this Focus Area must allow a student and instructor to understand and determine the operation of individual components, the linkages between components, and the properties of components and sub-components that optimize the overall performance of a complex electro-mechanical system.</p>
<p>Focus Area 2 Design and Prototyping Tools - Methods and tools must build upon recently developed design tools and low-cost rapid prototyping innovations, and develop or expand open-source low cost, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) rapid prototyping tools for use in instructional environments (such as those developed under the MENTOR program) as well as for in-field or on-site use.</p>
<p>Focus Area 3 Project Kits and Massively Open On-line Course (MOOC) - Performers must develop or expand upon an existing, widely used, delivery MOOC substrate and directly link to the MENTOR2 experimental projects and Design/Simulation Tools.</p>
<p>Focus Area 4 Evaluation - Performers must develop a demonstration and test plan that allows for the evaluation of the methods, tools and materials being developed in Focus Areas 1, 2, and 3. Successful MENTOR2 tools will be evaluated at a small number of defense and civilian instructional facilities.</p>
<p>While MENTOR2 is aimed at improving defense readiness, its instructional tools will have applicability for both defense and civilian training.</p>
<p>Leveraging the U.S. do-it-yourself culture including the recent "Maker" movement, MENTOR2 will develop and improve student and instructor access to the latest design and manufacturing methodologies and hardware, and further develop those technologies for the educational and training environment.</p>
<p>MENTOR2 will also develop tools to catalyze authentic, project-based education, where the need for technical understanding is organic to the projects being done and will address the need to assess student performance by integrating assessment with education through authentic problem-based projects.</p>
<p>The MENTOR2 Proposers' Day Webinar will be held on December 11, 2013 at 9:00 a.m. (EST). The goals of the webinar are to: (a) introduce the research community (academia and industry) to the MENTOR2 program vision and its goals; (b) explain the mechanics of a DARPA program and the objectives and milestones of this anticipated effort; and (c) encourage and promote collaborative arrangements among potential organizations that have expertise, facilities and capabilities for executing a research and development program responsive to the MENTOR2 program goals. The Proposers' Day Webinar will include an overview presentation by the Program Manager and an information session to respond to questions from participants.</p>
<p>Advanced registration is required. Webinar details including webcast registration and webcast URL are given on the registration website at <br />http://www.sa-meetings.com/MENTOR2. Website Login Information - Username: mentor2, Password (case sensitive): arlington.</p>
<p>There is no fee for the MENTOR2 Proposers' Day Webinar. Participation via the webcast is limited to 500 participants. The registration cutoff date is 4:00 p.m. (EST), December 6, 2013, and early registration is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>Further administrative questions should be addressed to DARPA-SN-14-11@darpa.mil. Please refer to the MENTOR2 Proposers' Day Webinar (DARPA-SN-14-11) in the subject line of all correspondence. This announcement is not a request for proposals; any so sent will be returned.</p>

<DESC>Technician needed from Radiometer America to repair the Radiometer ABL80, S/N 302061, EE# 337623, located at 4N116-1-UD.  Sole Source for this procurement will be Radiometer America Inc.

Radiometer America will provide onsite service and repair for  ABL 80 Blood Gas Machine. 

Sole Source per FAR :

Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1) - Radiometer America, the original equipment manufacturer, is best suited for the service needed because of their experience and knowledge with servicing Blood Gas analyzing equipment. They are uniquely and solely qualified to perform this service.  This equipment is proprietary to Radiometer America.  Radiometer America has intimate knowledge of this unit and has a history with our Blood Gas equipment. They manufactured it, installed it, and have maintained it. 


 Unusual and Compelling Urgency (FAR 6.302-2, 6.303-2(a)(9)(ii)) - Urgency is needed for this repair because having equipment down unit has to defer scans and studies, ultimately disrupting patient care.

<CONTACT>Michael A. Rivera, Contracting Officer, Phone (850)883-2676, Fax (850)882-9599, Email michael.rivera.2@us.af.mil
<DESC><p>A sole source procurement is contemplated with CertiVox, 548 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94104. AFRL/RWWN requires Government Purpose License Rights of the Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic C/C++ Library (MIRACL) software. This requirement is for support of the Secure Micro Digital Datalink (SmDDL) cryptographic program. The MIRACL cryptographic SDK provides the implementation of certain low-level mathematic and cryptographic primitives used in the Trusted Module of the SmDDL. In particular, primitives to perform elliptic curve math and AES block encryption are used. A set of higher-level library functions are implemented on top of the low-level primitives. This higher-level library, the SmDDL crypto library, provides the application programming interface (API) to all the necessary cryptographic functions performed by the Keymat and Gatekeeper Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs). In addition to the above, the following criteria demonstrate MIRACL's unique qualifications:</p>
<p>1. Language: The library and all of its dependencies shall be implemented in ISO Standard C or C++; they may include embedded assembly language for the ARM Cortex M3.</p>
<p>2. License suitability: The licensing terms of the cryptographic library shall permit unlimited, unconditional use by the government without requiring the dissemination of SmDDL source code.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: The library shall provide support for the following primitives:</p>
<p>a. AES-128 ECB</p>
<p>b. Large integer (BIGINT) math</p>
<p>c. Elliptic curve point manipulation for NIST prime curves</p>
<p>4. Compiled size: The library, when compiled using the ARM RealView compilation tools, shall not cause either the Keymat CSCI nor the Gatekeeper CSCI to exceed their allocated program space (ROM and RAM).</p>
<p>5. Computation speed: The execution times of the cryptographic functions as used by SmDDL shall permit the BSU to meet all of the performance requirements for group formation (see BSU SRD section 4.3.6). Acquisition of MIRACL is required to satisfy SmDDL developmental goals of a government-owned technology unencumbered by proprietary intellectual property rights that would hamper its use in a multiple of UAS platforms. If a vendor other than CertiVox provides the software license, the expected cumulative level of effort required for replacement of MIRACL is 15.7 man-months, with an additional 6-month delay to the start of Security Verification (SV) test development, SV test execution, and ultimate SmDDL certification. However, all interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) which should, if possible, include at least three references of the above materials having been provided to customers for use as preformed fragments in weapons; these will be considered if received by noon central time zone on 11 Dec 13. Submit to: Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RWK), Attn: Michael Rivera, 101 W. Eglin Blvd., Ste. 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810. Please refer technical questions to Mr. David Eaton, 850-882-8901, and business questions to Michael Rivera, 850-883-2676. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and all recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting points of contact identified above. The Ombudsman is Ms. Barb Gehrs at 937-904-4407.</p>

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
BILLING, COLLECTIONS AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEM (BCAS) 
FOR TPOCs CONVERSION SYSTEM
 FOR THIRD PARTY COLLECTION SERVICES
NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER 
SAN DIEGO

1.0    Introduction/Background

1.1 Background:  Various portions of U.S.
 Code (USC), the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and Department of Defense (DoD) directives require the Services to bill certain payers for the cost of healthcare delivered to persons who are seen in fixed Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs).  Specifics of the statutory and regulatory requirements can be found in 32 CFR 728 (requires that designated non-DoD beneficiaries be billed for healthcare delivered in Naval MTFs â referred to as Medical Services Accounts (MSA)), 10 USC 1095 (requires DoD MTFs to bill third party payers for the costs of healthcare delivered to DoD beneficiaries with other health insurance (OHI) â referred to as Third Party Collections (TPC)), 42 USC 2651-2653 (which requires DoD MTFs to bill entities for the cost of healthcare incurred as a result of a tort liability â referred to as Medical Affirmative Claims (MAC), and DoD 6010.15-M Military Treatment Facility Uniform Business Office (Uniform Business Office Manual).

1.2 These billing functions have been performed by Naval Medical Center, San Diego Uniform Business Office personnel using the patient encounter data recording, billing, and collection functions resident in the Composite Healthcare System (CHCS) and the Third Party Outpatient Collection System (TPOCS).
  However, as per the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) memo of 13 Dec 2010, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) will sunset support for Third Party Outpatient Collection System on 1 Oct 2014, while Third Party Outpatient Collection System will be unusable for new claims with service dates after 1 Dec 2013.

<DESC>The IRS anticipates issuing a fixed price single award for the Tuxedo Software Maintenance Renewal. Award will be made to the Offeror whose quote has been determined to provide the best value. Under this RFQ, best value will result from the selection of the technically acceptable quote with the lowest evaluated price. Offerors providing the required brand name maintenance will be considered technically acceptable.
<p>See the attached SF18 Request for Quotations for specific supplies/services for additional line items.</p>
<p>Basis for Award<br /><br />The Government will make award to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror. The technical factors are not being assigned a point score but instead the proposal shall be considered for award if it meets the minimum criteria set forth in the RFP.<br /><br />As compared to the best value approach, the principal advantage of the "lowest price technically acceptable" basis is simplicity. It reduces the burden on both the contractor community (to prepare and submit a proposal) and the Government (to evaluate each proposal and justify a source selection). It also creates the appearance of greater objectivity and fairness.</p>
<p>Instructions</p>
<p>All resellers/manufacturers that can deliver and/or perform the equivalent products/services shall submit a written quotation which includes any applicable discounts; along with the completed IRS Price Quotation Sheet on or before 8:00am November 25, 2013. The Vendor shall be selected based on the lowest priced technically acceptable quote. All quotes shall include: Price(s), FOB Point of Contact (name and telephone number), delivery date(s), business size, payment terms, Taxpayer Identification Number and Dun &amp; Bradstreet number. All products/services must be in compliance with Section 508 1194.31 and 1194.41 of the Rehabilitation Act. Vendors shall provide proof of conformance through the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT).<br />Offerors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.com.</p>
<p>All questions must be submitted by email to Treva.L.Paris@irs.gov.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.

Include one (1) originally signed copies of the form in the Original Volume II. The Offeror shall submit the following as part of Volume II:<br /><br />A. Base Contract Pricing - The Offeror shall submit its price information based on its proposed fixed-price fully burdened hourly labor rates for each proposed labor category.</p>
<p>The Offeror shall propose fixed fully burdened hourly labor rates for each labor category it proposes for each year throughout the projected life of this contract. NIST anticipates the award of an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for one (1) base period of twelve (12) months from date of award plus four (4) twelve-month option periods. The Offeror shall assume that the contract will begin on February 3, 2014. Therefore, each proposed labor category shall be assigned a fixed fully burdened hourly labor rate for the base period and each of the four option periods. <br /><br />Under the anticipated IDIQ contract, labor-hour task orders shall be issued. For each future task order under the anticipated contract, the contractor shall propose a total Not-to-Exceed price based on the labor rates in the contract and will be asked to provide a price breakdown to enable the Government to make a price fairness and reasonableness determination. <br /><br />The Offeror shall propose fixed fully burdened hourly labor rates for the following periods. The Offeror shall assume for price proposal preparation purposes that the contract will begin on February 3, 2014. However, these dates are not binding and the actual period of performance of the base contract may be different than listed below:<br /><br />Base Period: February 3, 2014 - February 2, 2015<br />Option Period I: February 3, 2015 - February 2, 2016<br />Option Period II: February 3, 2016 - February 2, 2017<br />Option Period III: February 3, 2017 - February 2, 2018<br />Option Period IV: February 3, 2018 - February 2, 2019<br /><br />The Offeror's fully burdened hourly labor rates must reflect the current market labor rates with any discounts provided. Current significant budgetary constraints demand that the impact of these constraints and ownership of the solution be shared throughout the public sector including its contractors. Offerors are asked to consider reduction or elimination of costs/pricing of the escalation of labor hour rates during the performance period of this contract. If the proposed labor rates will increase throughout the life of the contract, the Offeror shall provide a justification for the escalation of each proposed fixed fully burdened hourly labor rate for each period. For example, if the proposed labor rates increase by 2% each period, a justification for this increase shall be submitted in the Business Volume.<br /><br />A. Task Order 1 Pricing - The Offeror shall also propose pricing for Task Order 1 and describe its proposed labor mix.</p>
<p>The pricing breakdown shall include the number of hours proposed per contract employee and the corresponding fully burdened hourly labor rates from the Base Contract Pricing. The proposed number of hours for each proposed contract employee shall be clearly identified and associated with the applicable labor category for each contract employee. For proposal preparation purposes, the Offeror shall assume a start date of February 2, 2014 for Task Order 1.<br />In order to facilitate the award process, ALL offers shall include a statement regarding the terms and conditions herein as follows:</p>
<p>The Offeror shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."<br />OR<br />The Offeror shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)"</p>
<p>Please note that this procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an Offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the Offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.<br />The successful Offeror must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at the website https://www.sam.gov. Failure or refusal to register in SAM will forfeit award.</p>

<p>&emsp;<br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />United States Department of Commerce<br />National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Ocean Service<br />Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS)<br />Field Operations Division, Pacific Operations Branch<br />Portable Laboratory Standard for Precision Pressure Sensors<br />November 14, 2013<br />PR# NCNT2000-14-00098</p>
<p><br />1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) collects analyzes and distributes historical and real-time observations and predictions of water levels, coastal currents and other meteorological and oceanographic data. This is part of an integrated National Ocean Service (NOS) program supporting safe maritime navigation, more productive water-borne commerce, and the needs of the National Weather Service, coastal zone management, engineering and surveying communities. The Center manages the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) around the coastal United States and the national network of Physical Oceanographic Real-Time Systems (PORTS&reg;) in major U.S. harbors. It conducts its programs through university, industry, Federal and State partnerships as appropriate. CO-OPS resides within NOAA's National Ocean Service.</p>
<p>The Field Operations Division (FOD) installs and maintains a variety of equipment and provides support services in order to ensure the efficient collection and dissemination of CO-OPS water level and meteorological data. Collection of tidal water level data at many locations requires both a pressure sensor to measure the variations in water level and a self contained gas purge system which supplies a constant flow of air to the bottom mounted pressure orifice. The data are then provided in real time via several means including by IP modem and through the GOES satellite system. CO-OPS transmits data from the majority of its NWLON and PORTS stations via the GOES satellite network.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>CO-OPS uses a precision oceanographic and meteorological instrumentation to provide quality water level and meteorological information at its numerous temporary and permanent water level stations. This purchase is for replacement batteries for use at new and existing permanent NWLON and PORTS stations as well as temporary installations in support of NOAA hydrography, photogrammetry, VDatum, and special projects. These batteries must meet rigorous physical and electrical characteristics to properly power the data collection platforms at these stations and only the PowerSonic PS-12400 12VDC 40Ah sealed gel cell battery is approved for use.</p>
<p>The PowerSonic PS-12400 is a standard item utilized throughout CO-OPS's fleet of water level stations. This purchase is for components to support these existing style stations. Significant engineering effort was utilized to ensure all interior components fit in the space available and are of appropriate materials and quality and are electrically compatible with the gauges they are to be integrated into. Implementing different components will result in additional cost and resources and will significantly delay the build of these mission critical items needed to support hydrography and photogrammetry. Also, the procurement of a different model battery would result delay for testing, training, and purchase of support equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>CO-OPS has a requirement for one-hundred (100) PowerSonic PowerSonic PS-12400 12VDC 40Ah sealed gel cell batteries for operational installation at National Water Level Observation Network(NWLON), Physical Oceanographic Real Time System (PORTS), hydrography, photogrammetry, VDatum, and other special project water level monitoring stations. These batteries are for use with existing equipment and must fit into an enclosure specially selected to fit this model battery which has been rigorously tested and is the only approved model for use with CO-OPS systems. These batteries are for use with sensitive scientific equipment electrically engineered specifically to operate with this model battery which must have the following characteristics.</p>
<p>12) Non-spillable Absorbent Glass Mat technology allowing safe operation in any position<br />13) Rugged impact resistant ABS case and cover<br />14) Approved for transport by air. Must be DOT, IATA, FAA, and CAB certified<br />15) Dimensions = 197mm long x 165mm wide x 170mm tall and a weight of less than 30 lbs<br />16) Must have heavy duty NB4 terminal posts and include nut and bolt fasteners<br />17) Nominal voltage of 12VDC with a 20 hour nominal capacity of 2A to 10.5VDC<br />18) Energy density of 1.42 Wh/in3 (20 hour rate)<br />19) Internal resistance of 10m&Omega;<br />20) Maximum discharge current 120A (maximum short duration discharge current 380A for 10 seconds)<br />21) Shelf life of better than 80% after storage for 6 months<br />22) Operating temperature range of -20&deg;C to 50&deg;C for charging and -40&deg;C to 60&deg;C for discharging</p>
<p>Order shall be delivered FOB to NOAA Tide Gauge Shop, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 within 45 days of award of contract.</p>
<p>4. DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>1. 4.1 Deliver one-hundred (100) PowerSonic PS-12400 12VDC 40Ah sealed gel cell batteries that meet all of the requirements listed above to NOAA Tide Gauge Shop, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98107 no later than 45 days after award of contract.</p>

The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

<CONTACT>Stefan Martiyan or Tina M Nevitt
<DESC>This requirement is for patent prosecution services for an invention developed by EPA scientists and other named individuals.  All questions need to be submitted no later than 11:00am Tuesday, November 26, 2013 electronically to nevitt.tina@epa.gov.  For a copy of the SF 18 and notice of invention by the inventors, please submit your request electronically.  This requirement is to suport EPA Case 778-13: Vane, et. al.  BACKGROUND:  The purpose of this requirement is to provide nonpersonal services for the preparation and filing of a patent application for the invention for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Case No. 778-13, ?Permselective Membranes with Tunable Properties.?  The invention was developed by Leland Vane and Vasudevan Namboodiri of EPA, along with Michael Abar, a Senior Environmental Employment Program enrollee working at EPA and Gui Lin, a post-doctorate research associate from the National Research Council, also working at EPA.  The invention discloses  a membrane that can dehydrate solvent streams using traditional pervaporation/vapor permeation separation processes.  The inventors believe that this membrane is the first of its kind. 
SCOPE OF WORK:  The contractor shall prepare a document in the form of a US patent application for the invention in EPA Case No. 778-13.  The application must, in form and substance, comply with the US patent laws (Title 35 U.S. Code) and the regulations of the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).
TASKS/REQUIREMENTS:  The order resulting from this request shall include the following tasks (for other direct costs the contractor shall include an estimated price/cost for those item, but the contractor shall only be reimbursed for the actual price/cost and their approved G&A rate stated in the resultant order):
Task 1 ? Patent Application:  The contractor shall submit a draft patent application to the EPA Patent Attorneys and inventors for review prior to preparation of final documents.  The EPA Patent Attorneys will authorize preparation of the final documents once the draft application is approved.
The contractor shall submit the draft application within two weeks of obligation.  If for some reason this time frame cannot be met, the contractor shall immediately contact the EPA Patent Attorneys to determine a revised scheduled date.  The EPA Patent Attorneys may authorize filing of the draft as formal patent application, and a revised draft as a US continuation-in-part application at a later date.
Once the EPA Patent Attorneys authorize the preparation of the final version of the US patent application, the contractor shall prepare the final version within one week of the date that authorization was given.  Copies of the final version of the patent application shall be forwarded concurrently to the inventor for execution and to the EPA Patent Attorneys.  The Power of Attorney shall include Laura Scalise, Reg. No. 45,778 and Randall Cherry, Reg. No. 51,556 and may include any and all registered patent attorneys and patent agents of the contractor.
Upon execution of the final US version by the inventor, the contractor shall receive said executed application and, shall promptly file the application in the PTO.  If instructed by the EPA Patent Attorneys, the contractor shall file unsigned copies of the patent application, and prepare the appropriate execution documents for late filing in accordance with PTO procedures.  As indicated above, if instructed by the EPA Patent Attorneys, the contractor shall file the draft application as a formal US application, with the understanding that the final version will be filed as a continuation-in-part application.  Also, if instructed by the EPA Patent Attorneys, the executed US application shall be transmitted to the EPA Patent Attorneys for filing. The contractor shall file with the formal US application a 1.102(c) petition-to-make-special, citing utility of the invention for materially enhancing the quality of the environment.  There is no filing fee for this petition.  (See MPEP 708.02 section V.)
Task 2 ? Information Disclosure Statement:  The contractor shall prepare and file an Information Disclosure Statement once information regarding prior art is provided to or becomes known to the contractor.  The Information Disclosure Statement must comply with PTO regulations.
Task 3 ? Assignment Documents:  The contractor shall prepare and forward assignment documents for execution by the inventors and shall file the executed assignment documents in the PTO.  EPA Patent Attorneys can provide a template if needed.  The Assignee is the United States Government, as represented by the Administrator of the US EPA.
Task 4 ? US Drawings:  If the informal patent drawings provided by the EPA are likely to be unacceptable by the PTO and formal patent drawings are necessary, the contractor shall obtain approval from the EPA Patent Attorneys for this service.  The contractor shall provide an estimate of drawing costs in their proposal.  Should the actual cost exceed the NTE amount, the contractor shall contact the Contracting Officer (CO) and EPA Patent Attorneys immediately, so that the purchase order can be modified.
Task 5 ? Official Actions:  The contractor shall include in their proposal an allowance for up to two hours of telephonic discussions and negotiations with the PTO and for preparation of routine documents - including but not limited to telephonic conversations about restriction requirements or Examiner?s amendments, and the like.  The contractors shall advise the EPA Patent Attorneys of the unofficial PTO application serial number as soon as the contractor receives it.  The contractor shall also forward a copy of official actions received from the PTO along with a copy of each item of cited prior art to the EPA Patent Attorneys.  However, the contractor shall not prepare a response to the actions unless a purchase order for the work is issued by the EPA or the purchase order currently active for this patent application is modified.
Task 6 ? Restriction Requirement:  It is possible that the Examiner will issue an office action in the form of a restriction requirement.  The contractor shall include in their proposal the cost for replying to a restriction requirement.
Task 7 ? US Fees:  The contractor shall pay the necessary filing fees subject to reimbursement by the EPA under this purchase order.  The contractor will only be reimbursed for the actual fees and their G&A.  Should the actual cost exceed the amount allowed in the purchase order, the contractor shall contact the CO and EPA Patent Attorneys immediately so that the purchase order can be modified. 
CONTINUED PROSECUTION AND PRESERVATION OF FILES: The contractor shall be aware that the EPA reserves the right to continue prosecution on its own or by contracting with another law firm.  Accordingly, the contractor shall maintain a complete file of work done and of correspondence with the PTO, and if directed by the EPA, return the files or transfer the files to the EPA using the most cost effective means to transfer the files. CONTINUED PROSECUTION:  For each office action subsequent to any restriction requirement, the contractor shall forward the action along with a quote for responding to the office action to the EPA Patent Attorneys within a week of the mailing date on the action.  The contractor shall not answer the office action until a purchase order for the work is received.  The quote shall be for the actual costs of the US PTO fees with the approved G&A cost, and the attorney?s legal costs with an explanation of the legal costs (number of hours, etc.).

The spring loaded target face resets itself after each shot. The IPSC Silhouette uses MGM's standard 3/8" AR500 steel for a long service life. Set the target on the included tube steel H-base for 5 second setup.

With accuracy development in mind, the object is to shoot through the hole and hit the hinged plate in the back. When this is successfully accomplished, you'll see a fluorescent red "flag" at the shoulder of the target. The target plate hinge is on an angle such that, after it is shot, gravity will close the door. Again, you have no resetting of the targets. You may want to paint the target plate the same fluorescent red, and for a real challenge for your shooters, designate the remainder of the body as a "no shoot".

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. <BR> <BR>(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may? (A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor?s managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. <BR> <BR>(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor?s obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property. (e) Definitions. (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause?

(A) Performed by the contractor; (B) Performed by the subcontractors; or (C) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control.

The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: (i) Hourly rate. (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.

(E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.

(A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor?s established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the-- (1) Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor? (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor?s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.

The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert ?$0? if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ?None?.?] <BR> <BR>(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. (4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): <BR> <BR>(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice met the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract.

(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost? (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments.

The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor?s payment will be made by check.

<p><em>No. </em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>QUESTION 2</em></span>: We believe that the restrictions placed on the location of the data center and proximity limitations seriously limits competition to a few companies in that area.  Many companies that provide IaaS are outside the DC Blast radius and the government specificity will limit competition and increase cost.</p>
<p><em>The above location limitations have been set keeping in mind the logistics of our technical personnel (locations) and ability to reach the offsite server room in a timely manner in the event of a disaster.</em></p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p>STATEMENT OF NEED<br />Helium</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Monterey, CA has a separate launch facility in Oakland, California that launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 4am and 4 pm Pacific Time. Each balloon requires approximately 80 cubic feet (CF) of helium. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the NWS is to receive and keep on-hand an adequate supply of helium (between 480 and 2,720 CF per week) to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying helium to the NWS office located at 21 Grace Hopper Ave. - Stop 5, Monterey, CA 93943-5505. The total amount of helium to be delivered for this requirement will normally be between 2,240 and 2,400 CF every other week (bi-weekly), but may go as high as 2,720 CF bi-weekly (between 58,400 and 70,720 CF annually).</p>
<p>4. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The base period of performance for this requirement is 12 months, beginning January 1, 2014 and ending December 31, 2014.<br /><br />5. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br /><br />All deliveries are to be made to the NWS office at&nbsp;21 Grace Hopper Ave. - Stop 5, Monterey, CA. 93943-5505&nbsp;The point of delivery is at the Upper Air Inflation building. The building is located inside a locked-fence compound area. A key for this area will be provided to the Contractor upon contract award. The key shall be returned to the NWS upon contract termination.</p>
<p>6. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Site Storage and Usage: All helium must be provided in individual cylinders as the facility is not arranged to allow for other configurations. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store up to 14 cylinders of helium at a time. It is the objective of this requirement to keep on hand between 480 and 2,720 CF of helium, with a minimum of 2,240 CF being used bi-weekly, leaving approximately a three-day supply of helium as backup stock in case of additional unplanned balloon launches, or other unforeseen circumstances. Actual usage will vary based on the need for additional balloon launches.</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: Deliveries shall be made every other week, with the actual schedule arranged with the NWS Observation Program Leader (OPL), Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC), or Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) upon contract award (see section 9 below for contact information).</p>
<p>Balloon launches occur twice a day, every day of the year, regardless of holidays. Therefore, the delivery schedule needs to be maintained regardless of holidays. If a holiday falls on a scheduled delivery day and the Contractor is not able to complete a regularly scheduled delivery, the Contractor shall make arrangements in advance for an alternate delivery date. The Contractor will contact the NWS office if a delivery is going to be delayed for any other reason.<br /><br />Transition Period: If this contract is awarded to other than the incumbent Contractor, then prior to the first day of the contract, the new Contractor and one of the agency points of contact (OPL, MIC, or ASA) shall establish the delivery schedule, including coordinating the initial delivery to coincide with the pickup of cylinders by the former contractor. Likewise, upon completion of this contract, if the new follow-on contract is awarded to other than the current Contractor, the current Contractor shall participate in the transition coordination efforts in order to minimize the risk of a missed balloon launch due to the helium being unavailable at the launch site. The end-of-contract transition period may include a lighter delivery in the final weeks of the contract.</p>
<p>Initial and Recurring Deliveries: For the initial delivery, the Contractor shall supply to the Place of Performance 2,720 CF of helium, in accordance with the coordinated date and time schedule. Thereafter, the Contractor will replenish back to 2,720 CF of helium on a bi-weekly basis in accordance with the arranged schedule, replacing all empty helium cylinders with full helium cylinders. The Contractor shall pickup the empty cylinders in the same trip. If additional deliveries are required prior to the next regularly scheduled delivery, the NWS will contact the Contractor and request the additional delivery, with delivery to be completed within two business days of being contacted.</p>
<p>A key to the fenced in area will be provided to the Contractor. The Contractor is responsible for ensuring the gates are properly secured upon departure. The key will be returned to the National Weather Service upon completion of the contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion with cap loose and nozzle facing out. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises.</p>
<p>Evidence of Delivery: The Driver shall provide evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by an NWS representative at the time of delivery. A copy of the signed receipt shall be left with the NWS representative, and a copy shall also be attached to the associated invoice when mailed.</p>
<p>Compliance: If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements (i.e. a delivery results in less than full replenishment of helium to 2,720 CF), the Government reserves the right to require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount (i.e. without additional delivery charges).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. SECURITY BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION</p>
<p>Due to the Contractor being permitted unsupervised access to the site, a basic security background investigation must be completed for all personnel who will have access to the gate key. The Contractor is required to designate at least one, but no more than three, contractor personnel to perform the helium deliveries. Prior to the key being issued, the designated personnel must pass a fingerprint check performed by the Department of Commerce Western Region Security Office (WRSO).</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for providing, at its own expense, all information necessary to complete the security investigation, including official fingerprint charts. The fingerprint charts shall be provided to the ASA for submission to the WRSO at least one week prior to the first delivery date.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not assign any personnel that do not receive a favorable result of the security investigation to perform deliveries to this site.</p>
<p>8. SAFETY</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.<br />Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the MIC or ASA at each office, where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>9. INVOICING</p>
<p>The Contractor will invoice on a monthly basis in arrears for that month's helium deliveries and related surcharges (i.e. cylinder rental fee, etc.). The invoice must include the following items:</p>
<p>a. Name and address of the contractor, which must be the same as that on the Purchase Order<br />b. Invoice date and invoice number<br />c. Purchase Order number and associated line item number from the Purchase Order<br />d. Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of supplies delivered, and date of delivery<br />e. Evidence of delivery by way of receipt signed by NWS representative at the time of delivery<br />f. Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice (a defective invoice is one that does not meet all the above requirements)</p>
<p>The invoices may be sent to the following address:</p>
<p>National Weather Service<br />21 Grace Hopper Avenue, Mail Stop 5<br />Monterey, CA 93943</p>

<p>The selection process will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15 source selection procedures. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded to the firms offering the best value to the Government. Non-price technical evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0001 to combined synopsis/solicitation W81XWH-14-T-0029.  The purpose of this amendment is to notify potential offerors to ensure that all provisions associated with this requirement are completed within the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) that can be accessed through the System for Award Management (SAM).  All other requirements remain the same. <br>  <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  This is Request for Quotation (RFQ), W81XWH-14-T-0029.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-70.  This action is 100% Small Business Set-Aside against NAICS code 811219 with a Size Standard of $19.0M.  <br>    <br>  Description of Requirements:  Contractor provision of Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) Support Services to be performed in accordance with the attached performance work statement (PWS).  <br>    <br>  CLIN structure is as follows:  <br>  0001 - Provision of on-site services in accordance with the PWS - 4 each  <br>  0002 - Other Direct Costs - associated with contractor personnel travel, rental equipment shipping, and repair costs of GFE as outlined in the PWS (The Government has estimated ODC's to be $4,500 - all quotes shall base the CLIN on this amount.) - 1 Job  <br>  0003 - pQCT XCT 3000 Scanner Rental - 4 each  <br>  0004 - Contract Manpower Reporting - 1 Job  <br>    <br>  Period of Performance:  16 December 2013 through 30 January 2015  <br>    <br>  Provisions: 52.212-1, Instructions to Offers - Commercial Items, 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, and 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  <br>    <br>  52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)  <br>    <br>  (a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  This is a best value procurement.  The Government may select to award to other than the lowest price offer, utilizing a trade off source selection process based on the evaluation of the non-cost factors.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers which are listed in descending order of importance:  <br>    <br>  1.  Past Performance  <br>  2.  Technical Capability  <br>  3.  Price  <br>    <br>  Past performance and technical capability, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  As the technical merits are equal in standing, price will become more important.  <br>    <br>  (b)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  <br>    <br>  (End of provision)  <br>    <br>  Evaluation Factors:  <br>    <br>  1.  Past Performance:  Past performance consists of two aspects for evaluation, past performance relevancy and performance confidence.  The first aspect is to evaluate the offeror's past performance to determine how relevant the effort accomplished is to the effort being acquired.  Common aspects of relevance include similarity of service/support; complexity; dollar value; contract type; and degree of subcontract/teaming.  The past performance evaluation considers each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance which results in an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the PWS requirements.  The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to establish a confidence assessment rating.  This rating is the result of determining how well the contractor performed the relevant past performance as it pertains to the PWS.  <br>    <br>  1.1.  Offeror's shall provide a minimum of two (2), not to exceed four (4), past performance references for efforts performed within the past 3 years that are of similar scope, size, and complexity to the requirements outlined within the PWS.  Offeror shall provide:  a brief description of the contract work performed; reference point of contact to include name, telephone number, and e-mail address; contract number; dollar value of the contract; and dates of contract performance.  It is not sufficient to state that the reference is similar in size, scope and complexity, a rationale must be provided to demonstrate that it is comparable.  Projects completed or are in progress that are described in the narrative will be evaluated for scope and degree of support to DOD, other federal agencies, or other comparable organizations.  <br>    <br>  1.2.  Offeror's shall describe any problems encountered in the performance of similar services and describe how the problems was/were resolved.  <br>    <br>  1.3.   Past performance information may be obtained from any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; interviews with Program managers, Contracting Officers, Fee Determining Officials, and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA).  <br>    <br>  1.4.   In the case where an offeror is without a record or where no relevant past performance exists within the offeror's organization or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  The Offeror's lack of past performance will be evaluated as an unknown/neutral rating having no favorable or unfavorable impact on the evaluation.  <br>    <br>  1.5.  Past Performance Relevancy Ratings:  <br>  Very Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  <br>  Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  <br>  Somewhat Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  <br>  Not Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  <br>    <br>  1.6.  Past Performance Confidence Assessment Ratings:  <br>  Substantial Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  <br>  Satisfactory Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  <br>  Limited Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  <br>  No Confidence - Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  <br>  Unknown Confidence (Neutral) - No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonable assigned.  <br>    <br>  2.  Technical Capability:  The offeror shall define their technical expertise which indicates a thorough understanding of the PWS.  The offeror shall provide documentation of knowledge and expertise of personnel required to perform the necessary tasks of the PWS.  <br>    <br>  2.1  Technical Capability Ratings:  <br>  Outstanding - Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements.  Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low.  <br>  Good - Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements.  Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is low.  <br>  Acceptable - Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.  Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.  <br>  Marginal - Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.  The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is high.  <br>  Unacceptable - Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies.  Proposal is unawardable.  <br>    <br>  3.  Price:  A price analysis of the offer will be used to evaluate the total price to support the selection and that the price proposed is fair and reasonable.  <br>    <br>  Submission of Response:  Offeror's shall submit responses to the RFQ in two parts - Technical and Price.  <br>    <br>  Page Limitation for Technical response is as follows:  <br>  1) Past Performance - 2 to 4 references - no more than 2 pages  <br>  2) Technical Capability - no more than 2 pages  <br>    <br>  Page Limitation for Price:  <br>  1) Pricing Schedule based on CLIN structure stated above - no more than 1 page  <br>  2) Provide supporting documentation of amounts quoted for CLINs 0001 (On-Site Service) and 0003 (pQCT XCT 3000 rental).

The anticipated period of performance will be three (3) years total consisting of a one (1) year base period, and two (2) one-year option periods, this contract shall not exceed three (3) years.

<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3675.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC>Project Manager Electronic Warfare invites Industry, Academia and other Government organizations to join them on 3 Dec 2013 to receive information briefings on PM EW's capability portfolio, and to interact and discuss potential approaches to cooperative research and development. The theme is  quote mark Exploring innovative concepts for partnering with Industry and others in the areas of ground Electronic Warfare (EW), Tactical Cyber, Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (EMSO) and tactical ground Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities. quote mark   Given today's environment of budget cuts and fiscal uncertainty, it is extremely important that Industry and others understand Army priorities, gaps, and where to make strategic investment decisions. PM EW, in conjunction with the Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) seek opportunities to help industry focus its Independent Research & Development (IR&D) on technology innovation that will bring maximum benefit to the Army. This collaborative outreach will not only help PM EW leverage Industry's IR&D resources, but Industry and others will benefit when their research and development programs are better matched to meet Army EW mission requirements.    <br>    <br>  TIME		AGENDA ITEM  <br>    <br>  1300-1310	Welcome & Admin  <br>  1310-1330	The State of PM EW   <br>  1330-1400	Multi Intelligence Teams and Army 2020  <br>  1400-1430	The Evolution and Future of Tactical EW  <br>  1430-1445   BREAK  <br>  1445-1515	Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations in a congested and Contested   Environment  <br>  1515-1545	The emerging Army Cyber Acquisition mission  <br>  1545-1615   Technology Base Investments & Opportunities  <br>  1615-1645   Q&A Panel Discussion  <br>  1645-1700   Closing Remarks  <br>  <br> Registration is required to attend.

We recognize our Collaborative Outreach event on the afternoon of 3 Dec 2013 is scheduled in parallel with the Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) Advanced Planning Briefing to Industry (APBI) C4ISR Day.  The APBI event was viewed as a target of opportunity when many Industry attendees would be in the APG, MD area, thus minimizing travel time and costs. The intent is to capitalize on this opportunity. It is our hope that the afternoon APBI and Outreach sessions are mutually exclusive, and do not detract or inhibit target Industry audience from attending either event.  We apologize in advance if this is not the case  <br>

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 16, Site 667, Shreveport VA Medical Center,VA256  NCO 16, Supply Product Team Division II

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: This is a sole source procurement of a newly available medical device from a small business estimated at $36,100.00.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:   This procurement will include the following Line Items:
         01-0027      1 CONSOLE, RF ASSURE MODEL 200      			6   EA 5000.0000
         01-0023      2 RF ASSURE DETECTION MAT, OR STD,  40X20                              6   EA  850.0000
         02-0029      3 RFS BLAIR PORT WAND                         			20   EA   50.0000
							Total: $36,100
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1; and FAR 13-106-1(b)(1)
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):    This equipment is highly specialized equipment for use in the Operating Room during surgical procedures.  It is used to detect cotton and gauze sponges, and can be used in a variety of types of surgical procedures.  It will decrease the time and manpower required in the OR for maintaining sponge counts during procedures and will eliminate instances of the surgical site being closed with sponges left inside the patient.  This RF sponge detection system is unique to RF Surgical Systems.  The VISN has tested its use and recommends that it be purchased to make surgical procedures quicker and safer for the patient.  It reduces OR time, anesthesia time, and reduces unnecessary xrays.  It also makes the quick handling of emergency and trauma cases less risky and limits staff exposure to biology hazards of handling soiled sponges and reduces our stream of disposable waste.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  RF Surgical Systems has already been awarded a contract for a similar system.  The mat on this order is available under that contract.  The Console and the Wands are new models which are not yet available under contract.  These items are new uses of technology which will become more widely available and more competitive in the future.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The prices can be determined fair and reasonable by commercial pricing methodologies because these same items are sold to private and non-profit hospitals and healthcare organizations across the country.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Internet and catlog searches revealed that RF Surgical Systems is currently the only manufacturer of this type of item.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  This method of sponge counting in the OR is becoming the standard of care.  The manufacturer is a small business.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  We will continue to monitor the market for the emergence of competitive items of this type.  It is only a matter of time before such items will be available from a variety of sources.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

PACS Installation/Upgrade - Off-Site Facilities - VAMC Durham


1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 6 Centralized Acuqisiton Service.

2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition to procure Access Control hardware and software for the off-site clinics and facilities administratively controlled by the VAMC Durham, NC.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services: Sonitrol will furnish, install, program and provide interface to the existing Sonitrol CAD Graphics/Physical Access Control System and associated hardware and software. The purpose is to provide the same monitoring capability of the existing Sonitrol Physical Access Control (PACS) system located at the main campus, to the off-site facilities. The scope of work consists of updating the existing access control network at the CBOCs/off-site facilities to bring them into full compliance with HSPD-12/FIPS mandates. 


4.	Statutory Authority:  
	( x )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  The Sonitrol access control system uses proprietary software and hardware to communicate/interface to the access/alarm computer in Police Control.  No other company has access to this proprietary software and hardware and therefore cannot provide a compatible expansion of our existing CAD Graphics alarm system and PIV Card system. Selection of an alternate system would require abandonment and removal of the existing Sonitrol network and would entail significant delays to the completion of the physical access control system and substantial expense to the government.


6.	Actions to Promote Competition: No other vendors have the ability to make their equipment or software interface with the existing Sonitrol system at the Durham VAMC and its satellite facilities. The requested scope of work is an expansion of an existing security network that utilizes proprietary software and hardware. Selection of any other vendor/supplier other than Sonitrol will require removal and replacement of the Sonitrol hardware and network that is presently installed at substantial expense to the government. It would also substantially delay implementation of the VACO and Department Of Homeland Security mandated PIV card and physical access control systems to be operational or in progress on or before 9/30/11.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  An Independent Government Estimate has been prepared which is based on adoption and installation of similar, security related systems.  The proposal presented by Sonitrol is well within the range of related work as determined by past history.


8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  N/A This acquisition is the expansion of an existing system that utilizes proprietary software and hardware that can not be obtained from any source other than the Original Equipment Manufacturer, Sonitrol.

9.	Other Considerations:  No other company has the ability to interface to the Sonitrol infrastructure due to the proprietary software and hardware needed. Additional access/alarm coverage is needed to support clinic activations and expansions that are already in progress and to comply with VACO and Dept of Homeland Security mandates.


10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None


11.	 Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: None. No action can supercede the copyright and patent law protection of the proprietary software and hardware required to operate this equipment.


12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
