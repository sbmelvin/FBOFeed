Blood and Various Blood Components

Notice of Award/Notice of Intent/Request for Sources Sought

On 1 Oct 2012, the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Palm Beach, FL awarded a blood products contract/purchase order per VAAR Part 806.302(a)(2) and US Code 38USC8153 and 7302.  This award is for the delivery of blood and various blood components, but is used secondary to receipt of other Federal Agency supplies of blood and blood components.  The period of performance was for 90 days and an estimated value of $150,000.  The awardee was to Florida Blood Services Inc., 10100 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St. N., Saint Petersburg, FL  33716.

Due to the continuing need of blood and various blood components by our veterans, a modification will be accomplished for an additional six(6) months with an estimated value of $300,000.  

However, at the end of the 6 month period it is most probable that a competed contract will be solicited although not required due to the statute noted above.  Therefore, sources are sought in the state of Florida to provide blood and various blood components to the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center.  It is unlikely that a source out of state could provide blood in a timely manner, although we would be interested if that were feasible.  At this time the duration is unknown, but may possibly be as long as a base and four(4) option years.

Please contact the undersigned for any questions or concerns regarding the award, modification or sources sought.
