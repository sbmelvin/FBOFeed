<ARCHDATE>06032005
<CONTACT>ANN MARGRAVE PURCHASING AGENT 9162789329     amargrave@usgs.gov;
<DESC>NA The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Invisible Software, 2058 Coastland Avenue, San Jose, CA 95125.  The proposed contract is to provide a comprehensive physics-based earthquake model in modern object-oriented computer code in collaboration with USGS scientists as follows:   SCOPE - When slip occurs on a fault, it changes the distribution of stresses in the surrounding rock.  Afterwards, the stresses undergo a slow change due to viscoelasticity.  The amount of slip is determined by stress-induced forces acting on the fault by friction, roughness, and other factors.  The primary goal of this contract is to develop computer code that calculates the amount of slip on the fault, the immediate changes in stress, and the evolution of stress over time caused by viscoelasticity.  The calculations will be performed using the finite element method (FEM).  The program shall address the following requirements:   STATEMENT OF PROBLEM - COMPUTATIONAL DOMAIN.  The computation takes place in a 3-D "coordinate space".  A non-linear transformation maps the coordinate space into the "physical space" where the earth resides.  Because the transformation is nonlinear, the coordinate space is a non-Euclidean space.  In particular, it is a Riemannian manifold with a curved metric.  The coordinate space is constructed in such a way that the gravitational equipotential surfaces are the level surfaces of one of its coordinates.  This ensures that the top and bottom surfaces of the computational domain are locally horizontal, and that there is no gravitational loading across the sides of the domain.  The program must be able to accept a geodetic model of the earth's gravitational field, construct the non-linear transformation between coordinate and physical spaces, and calculate the Riemannian metric of the resulting curved manifold.  FEM FORMULATION.  The finite element method is carried out in the computational domain.  Because the domain is a curved manifold, it is necessary to use a tensorized version of FEM instead of the standard version.  In the tensorized version of FEM, all physical equations must be expressed in tensors in a form appropriate for curved space.  All volume and surface integrals must be performed using curved-space formulations involving the metric and Levi-Civita tensors.  The program must be able to generate a mesh surrounding a specified fault system.  Cell boundaries are positioned to coincide with the fault surfaces, and the mesh includes special nodes that represent slip along the fault surfaces.  The program will include a linear solver able to handle very large problems and able to solve sparse linear systems of several million equations on a desktop PC in a few minutes.  The solver must be able to impose constraints, for example, constraining the motion of certain nodes to lie in a fault surface.  The constraint support must be intrinsic to the solver (for example, not relying on the addition of fictional "springs").  It must be possible to modify constraints "on-the-fly" without recomputing the coefficient matrix.  The FEM code will be constructed in object-oriented form, and will support cells of varying shapes, including hexahedra, tetrahedra, triangular prisms, and quadrilateral pyramids.  The FEM code will be sufficiently general to handle any arbitrary cell shape, needing only a suitable description of the desired shape.  It will also handle both linear and quadratic cells.  ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES.  The program will be able to calculate the evolution of stress over time, caused by viscoelastic relaxation of the rock.  It will support both Newtonian and non-Newtonian viscoelastic materials.  The program will be able to calculate the effects of friction on the fault surface by calculating the normal and tangential forces at each node and making them conform to a fiction model.  A special type of quadratic cell is required for this calculation, since standard quadratic FEM cells to not allow physically correct calculation of surface forces.  As a validation tool, the program will incorporate an analytic dislocation solver, which can be used in simple cases to provide analytic solutions for comparison to the FEM solutions.  The analytic solver will implement a solution similar to the well-known Okada formulas, except modified and extended so that the fault slip is given by an FEM shape function.  An additional validation tool will be a built-in patch-test module that will test various cells and combinations of cells to ensure they behave correctly.  The program will include a graphics module able to draw images on an internal bitmap and export them to TIFF files.  The images will be used to visualize the FEM meshes and other program output as needed.  The program will be able to handle slip along non-planar faults by constraining motion along the fault surface in such a way that it produces the correct total value for the seismic moment tensor at each FEM node.  GEOPHYSICAL EFFECTS. The program will support both flat-earth and curved-earth computations.  The program will include a geodetic model which takes into account:  the oblateness of the earth; centrifugal forces due to earth's rotation; and the variation of gravitational acceleration with depth.  It will account for gravitational body forces and for the effects of friction and roughness along the fault.  The program will allow for specifying the elastic parameters of the crust, and allow them to vary with location.  It will calculate the effects of the viscoelastic behavior of the lower crust and permit the elastic parameters, viscosity, and non-Newtonian exponent to vary with location.  In general, the program will be carefully constructed so that additional geophysical effects can be added over time, without rendering the existing code obsolete.   PROGRAMMING CONSIDERATIONS - The program will be written in C++, and will be designed to be portable. There are several dimensions to portability.  A.  Code portability.  The code will adhere to the ISO C++ standard, and not use functionality specific to any one operating system.  The program will also avoid arcane or obscure code constructions (whose support might vary amount different compilers) and programming practices that are known to introduce portability issues.  Where system dependency is unavoidable (e.g., file naming conventions), such code will be isolated in one place for easy modification.   B.  Data portability.  Strict control of I/O on a byte level (so that data files are byte-for-byte identical) will be maintained to ensure data-file portability on different systems.  Where the code must read files prepared by other programs (i.e., text files created by a text editor), the code will be flexible enough to accept a variety of different formats, and such code will be isolated in one place so additional formats can be added easily.  C.  Command portability.  When programs perform a large set of functions, users often write script files to conveniently issue a complicated series of commands.  Since script files tend to be non-portable, this can make it difficult to get the program to perform the same task on different systems.  This problem will be avoided by defining a simple script language, and building in code to read the script and execute the commands.  D.  Time portability.  In order to write code that will execute on future computer systems, running operating systems that are yet to be developed, the program will not rely on any facility that has a significant risk of becoming unavailable in the foreseeable future.  E.  Self-diagnostics.  The program will have built-in diagnostics to run tests of the various program modules and verify that they are operating correctly.  This will allow each new version of the program, and each port to a different system, to be immediately tested by running a test script.  F.  Scientific portability.  The contractor shall ensure program portability to a variety of seismotectonic settings, as well as ensure access to scientists with more modest computer skills.  G.  Deliverables.  1.  Data identified below are to be in digital report format, and can be transmitted either by e-mail or as anonymous ftp data transfer.  Period of performance: 07/01/2004 through 03/31/2005.   Invisible Software can provide a professional computer scientist with broad expertise in math and physics, who is actively developing a 3-D FEM model to simulate earthquake processes, so has a detailed understanding of the mathematical and physical basis for our rapidly evolving scientific observations and deductions.  This combination of skills is unique in the computer science field and provides a highly qualified match for writing programs that use advanced math to analyze and model interconnected physical processes.  Thus, the vendor can quickly and efficiently construct the core computer model in modern object-oriented code, and then add program modules that both develop the complexity of the analysis and allow custom-designed earthquake studies.  The vendor is an expert in writing computer programs in C++ and is experienced in all phases of the software design cycle, from concept to architecture to coding to testing to documentation and deployment; and then to upgrading and revising for new operating environments, new hardware, and new customer requirements.  The vendor is familiar with 3-D FEM models in general, and the specific elements required to fully develop a comprehensive earthquake model.  In addition, the vendor could immediately begin writing computer code to construct the required products, and has the skills, expertise, and training required to complete this project in a timely fashion.   THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government; no additional synopsis will be published.

<DESC>Integrated Ethics Program The Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO), Washington, D.C., intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to the Center for Applied Ethics and Professional Practice of the Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC).  For the past 20 months, EDC has worked with the National Center for Ethics in Health Care (Ethics Center) on the development of educational products to support the establishment of Integrated Ethics Programs (IEPs) at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities across the nation.  EDC applies their knowledge of health care ethics and, specifically, the IEP philosophy into the production of educational materials and curricula for health care professionals, for a diverse range of products. EDC provides advice regarding the design and development of materials and tools in multiple formats, including video, on-line modules, workshops, workbooks, and web design. It contributes to the development of strategies to help health care professionals deal with uncertainty and handle values-based conflicts. It develops products that focus VHA facility leaders on ways to systematically improve ethical health care practice.  EDC has an established relationship with VHA staff in the field who have partnered with the Ethics Center in developing the IEP initiative.  EDC’s superior specialized knowledge of health care ethics and curriculum design/development, combined with full understanding of VHA needs, and knowledge of this particular project are unique. The success of this national initiative requires the continued leadership of this contractor and a short time-line. The additional products must be completed by April 2005.  The proposed contract action is for service for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties with the capability to provide the required services should submit a capability statement to the Contracting Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days after initial publication of this notice.  If there are any questions, you may call the Contracting Officer, Priscilla Lee at (202) 273-8762.  Please reference RFI 101-26-04. Page 1

<DESC>This requirement is in support of the national deployment of the Integrated Dispatch & Receipt (ID&R) Program.  The RCS is a Robotic Containerization System that can load sleeved/lidded or unsleeved/unlidder letter/flat trays into postal containers or pallets.  It accommodates all standard letter and flat trays at an approximate rate of ten trays per minute (including sweep time).  The system coordinates the transport of trays into the robotic work cell and sorts them by destination. 

The RCS is designed in a modular manner to promote a flexible system design and simple maintenance.  The system modules consist of:
•	Two identical ABB four axis robots arranged end-to-end
•	Two ABB robot controllers
•	Two Custom gripper assemblies
•	Core conveyor system
•	Power distribution system
•	Custom user interface PC
•	Custom power control enclosure

Each system consists of two cells.  Each cell has its own feed conveyor, robot and robot controller.  Each robot serves 12 sort positions (or 2:1 ratio for pallets).  The RCS utilizes a two-armed, two-zoned approach to provide better performance, throughput, and operator interface.  This redundant design permits system operation should one robot fail.  This design feature, combined with the built-in safety system, makes it practical to troubleshoot and repair a failure in one robot cell while the remaining cell is used for production.

This engineering program is estimated to deploy 67 units initially and provide an option for an additional 15 units.

This will be a noncompetitive award to ABB Inc.; 2487 S. Commerce Dr., New Berlin WI 53151-2717.  Point of contact: Stefan Larsson, (262) 785-3405.

<DESC>This synopsis is issued for comments on the draft Request for Proposal, PWS and attachments only.  This requirement is to replace outdated mailing systems at 444 locations throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam and various remote locations.  Installation shall also include Coast Guard cutters home ported on the east, west, and gulf coasts of the United States.  The U.S. Coast Guard processes millions of pieces of mail annually at more than 444 locations throughout the world, including aboard Coast Guard Cutters.  The Coast Guard Cutters often perform operations at sea for periods ranging from a few weeks to 6 months or more. As a result, the equipment type and maintenance program must ensure that cutters can sustain meter operations for these periods. While each of these locations has a designated Official Mail Manager, this is not a full-time position and processing mail is a collateral duty shared by many different personnel.  Consequently, the Coast Guard relies on automation to minimize errors and the time spent handling and processing mail.  A copy of the RFP and PWS with attachments can be obtained from FedBizOpps following this listing. Interested parties are strongly encouraged to download their own copy of the draft RFP.  Industry comments will be fully considered in preparation for the final RFP.  The USCG will not provide individual responses, and requests that no general telephone or email inquiries be made to the Contracting Officer or any USCG employee. Comments on the draft RFP, PWS and attachments shall be submitted no later than February 23, 2004, 11:00 a.m. (EST).  All responses must be submitted electronically to Ms. Faye Jones, fjones@comdt.uscg.mil. This request for comment is not a commercial solicitation and the Government will not pay for any information submitted or for any costs associated with providing this information.

<DESC>NA The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) plans to procure a sole source from Electric Research, Inc. (ERI), to perform a survey and analysis of electromagnetic fields (EMF) and radiation (EMR) associated with the Acela rail infrastructure and operations from New Haven, CT and Boston, MA.  The contractor will be required to characterize and quantify the frequency, time and spatial variability of the intensity of static and extreme low frequency (ELF) electric and magnetic fields and also measure relevant broad band radio-frequency (RF) radiation (EMR) emissions associated with the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES) train control, and with track signaling and data radio system.  This data shall be compared with the 1999 report, “EMF Monitoring on Amtrak’s  Northeast Corridor”.  Measurements performed under this requirement will obtain 24 hours ELF/EMF monitoring data to compare the EMF levels before Acela Regional and Express trains commenced operations, with after electrification EMF levels due to catenary and substations infrastructure and to rail operations, in both urban and rural settings and at environmentally sensitive locations along the track.

This service is being acquired for the US Air Force Academy Aeronautics Laboratory, HQ USAFA/DFAN.  The Aeronautics Laboratory is attempting to control the air flow near simple aerodynamic bodies using a plasma-based actuator.   Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.  No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.

<SUBJECT>59--BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR UNMANNED SYSTEMS AND ROBOTICS
<SOLNBR>N0016404R6648
<CONTACT>J.D. MARTIN 812-854-3723 J.D. MARTIN 812-854-3723
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) is conducting research and development directed toward unmanned systems and robotics in support of our nation’s warfighters for the DoD Joint Robotic Program’s National Unmanned Systems Experimentation Environment (NUSE2) project. NSWC Crane is seeking proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding in these specific technological areas. Proposals may be based on fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; development of associated manufacturing techniques and processes; development of testing, distributed testing and experimentation environments; experimentation and testing data archiving; modeling and simula tion of unmanned or robotic components, subsystems and systems; simulation-based acquisition for unmanned systems; integrated data environments and product data managers for unmanned systems.   The technical areas of interest are unmanned vehicles, robotics, associated payloads, peripherals, control systems and communications systems, with a specific interest in proposals that directly support the efforts of the NUSE2 program. This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of three years from the date of publication. Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns. NSWC Crane encou rages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for HBCUs/MIs. The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be funded incrementally for periods up to five years subject to the availability of appropriations and funded between $10,000 to $10,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic(s) (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds). More than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area, and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation. Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvem ents are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding. In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper"). This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. Offerors should submit the white papers electronically. A title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work must accompany the white paper. The Government reserves the right to request a full technical and cost proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Offerors submitting the most promising white paper s will be encouraged to submit full technical and cost proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not guarantee funding or assure a subsequent award. Offerors may submit full technical and cost proposals even if they did not submit a white paper or their white paper was not identified as promising. The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail.   White papers (and proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria:  (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer softwa re developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted (Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs (subject to the availability of funds). These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible businesses may submit a proposal. White papers may be s ubmitted at any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  Please send white papers and proposals via e-mail to martin_j@crane.navy.mil or regular mail to Commander, ATTN: Mr. J.D. Martin, Code 1164EF, Building 64, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5011. (Note: e-mail is preferred.) Please refer to BAA number N00164-04-R-6648 in all correspondence and communications.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to purchase complete Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), associated Ground Control System (GCS) components (other than standard personal computers that are required to operate the UAVs in a autonomous manner) and Software for Robotic Research at NSWCDD, on a restricted 100% Small Business Setaside basis.  The required items and quantities are:  UAV  with all GCS components, including in-aircraft video camera with wireless transmitter and receiver, radio modem data link (can be modulated on video signal, if desired) for transmission of waypoints and other telemetry data, standard Futaba  (backup) radio controller, and Ground Control Software (2 EACH) and Ground Control Station Software Developer's Kit (1 EACH).  The following minimum specifications apply:  EACH UAV SHALL:   (1) Be capable of powered flight and shall have autonomous take off and landing capability from a paved 500 ft runway.  (2) Have available payload capacity of at least one (1) pound at maximum take off weight.  The available payload capacity shall fit in a cavity within the UAV and shall be accessible from the bottom of the UAV with removal of simple fasteners.  (3)  Have at least a 20 minute flight duration with its optional one (1) pound payload insta lled.  (4)  Have a fixed focal length, fixed view, video camera with at least 640 X 480 pixel 16 bit color resolution.  The UAV video shall be transmitted to the GCS on a radio system in the 1710 - 1850 Mhz Government frequency band.  Each UAV shall transmit on a separate channel to avoid cross talk of the two (2) video signals.  Each UAV shall have a two way transceiver operating in any of the Government owned frequency bands between 30.0 and 42.0 Mhz.  (5) Have full autopilot capability to include automatic heading, speed and altitude control.  The autopilot subsystem shall be capable of receiving a flight path defined by a minimum of 100 waypoints in standard WGS-84 Global Positioning System (GPS) format.  Each UAV shall be capable of receiving new waypoints while in flight in order to support ground based UAV flight path control.  (6)  Have a rate of reception of the comple te set of 100 waypoints of at least 10 waypoints/second.  Each UAV shall provide a buffer that will allow the newly received waypoints to be stored and a checksum to be computed prior to application to the autopilot system.  If a checksum error is detected by the UAV on receipt of a waypoint set update, the UAV shall not implement the received waypoint set, but shall transmit an error message to the GCS.  (7) Be capable of transmitting its current GPS position, its current speed setting, heading and altitude setting to the GCS.  Additional data transmission to the GCS is also acceptable.  (8)  Be outfitted with a standard, 72 - 73 Mhz, radio control receiver so that emergency control from a ground based controller using a standard Futaba like radio, can be achieved.  EACH GCS SHALL:   (1) Include a two way transceiver operating in the same Government owned frequency bands betwe en 30.0 and 42.0 Mhz as the UAVs.  Both UAVs shall operate on different frequencies to ensure that there is no cross talk between ground stations or between UAVs.  (2)  Support transmission of a minimum 100 waypoint set to the UAV in one (1) GCS commanded operation.  (3)  Be capable of transmitting a complete set of 100 waypoints to the UAV within 10 seconds.  Support of transmission of smaller blocks or of individual waypoints from the GCS to the UAV is desired.  (4) Include for waypoint transmission from the GCS to the UAV, some form of error detecting checksum, so that an invalid waypoint set is detectable by the UAV.  (5)   Provide a display mechanism within the GCS Software which allows the UAV's working waypoint set to be displayed along with the update waypoint set (color coded differently from the working waypoint set) on a single ground based computer monitor.  (6)   D isplay an error status if the UAV transmits an error message after receipt of an updated waypoint set.  EACH GROUND CONTROL SYSTEM SOFTWARE KIT SHALL:  (1) Provide a minimum of two (2) operating licenses for any proprietary GCS software.  (2)  Provide one (1) Application Programmer's Interface to the proprietary GCS based software so that additional functionality can be added by NSWCDD.

The substitution of any other manufacturer’s product would negatively impact the NGATS project. The information gained during integration of the DRT 1301B receiver into Project 43003 will be used in this project, and cannot be used to integrate equipment from other manufacturers. A new integration process and its associated time-consuming activities would have to be repeated for the NGATS project should any other manufacturer’s equipment be used. This would cause work stoppage in other dependent areas of the NGATS project and will lead to failures in meeting critical project schedule and performance objectives.  Delivery would be to the Naval Suppo rt Activity – Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 334220 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC-PC) intends to award a sole source simplified acquisition to BAE Systems, Inc. of 1 Hazeltine Way, Greenlawn, NY 11740 for conduct of an engineering analysis to develop modifications to the AN/VRC-99B(C) radio system used for line-of-sight (LOS) command and control of the AN/WLD-1(V)1 Remote Minehunting System (RMS) to use one set of antennas for at least two radio inputs. Considerations for expanding sharing of radios of up to four units are also a part of the analysis. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  Conduct of this engineering analysis requires an in-depth and unique knowledge of the AN/VRC-99B(C) radio system. The AN/VRC-99B(C) radio, manufactured by BAE Systems, was competitively chosen at the beginning of the RMS development program by the prime development contracto r and the data link subsystem (DLS) was subsequently designed and tested around it for LOS operations. BAE Systems, as the sole original equipment manufacturer (OEM),  has the unique insight into the radio design required to successfully complete this analysis within the required timeframe. Use of any other source would result in significant duplication of cost as well as an unacceptable delay in the program schedule. Contract Specialist: Mary Hines, Code XPS1, NSWC-PC, 100 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001, email mary.f.hines@navy.mil. NAICS is 334419.  The award will be based on the RFQ on or about 15 Jun 04.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Panama City FL intends to award a sole source contract to Sperry Marine, 1070 Seminole Trail, Charlottesville, VA 22901 for the purchase of 3 each Non-Slep Radar Kits consisting of: Antenna 4’ 65604/A/X, Turning unit 65825/LAR/X-7, Processor 65800RARR, Manual, Serial Interface Unit (SIU). This acquisition is sole source for the following reasons. The Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) vehicle was first delivered in 1984 and had a service-life design of 20 years. Currently, the Navy has a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the LCAC. Under SLEP, the LCAC will enter the 21st century with markedly improved performance and an increased life span. These Radar Kits are compatible with existing Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) equipment and are the only Radar Kits that are 100% compatible with the existing LCAC SLEP equipment. Use of ano ther company’s radar kits may introduce new or changed existing parameters that may do more harm than good to the LCAC system. Failure of the LCAC system could result in loss of life as well as significant damage and maybe even the loss of fleet assets.  Delivery would be to the Naval Support Activity – Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 334511 applies.

<DESC>SPECIFICATION ELECTRON TUBE, MAGNETRON - 7.8 to 8.5 GHz, 20 Kilowatt peak output power.

The complete requirements for procuring the coaxial pulsed magnetron described herein shall 
consist of this document and the latest issue of specifications, Mil-PRF-1 and Mil-Std-1311

Tunable frequency 7.8 to 8.5 GHz integral magnet, air-cooled, 20 Kw nominal peak power output, for land, seaborne and airborne in both manned and unmanned platforms.
These ratings are interrelated, and it does not necessarily follow that combinations of ratings can be obtained simultaneously.
The temperature is to be measured at the point indicated on drawing 1236AS3240.
The tuning mechanism shall be capable of withstanding a static torque of in-oz listed in maximum box at the ends of its travel.
The magnetron shall be capable of normal operation without electrical breakdown with the input bushing in air to normal atmospheric conditions.
Prior to the application of high voltage, the cathode shall be heated to the required initial operating temperature.  Voltage and time as shown in test conditions.
The characteristics of the applied pulse must be those that result in proper starting and oscillation.  
The rate of rise of the voltage pulse (rrv), the percentage of pulse voltage ripple, and the rate of pulse voltage fall are among the more important considerations.
The rate of rise of voltage (rrv) shall be expressed in kilovolts per microsecond (kv/µs) defined by the steepest tangent to the leading edge of the voltage pulse above the 70 percent amplitude point.  Any capacitance used in the viewing (measuring) circuit shall not exceed 6 Pico farads (pf).
In handling and mounting the magnetron, care must be exercised to prevent demagnetization.  The use of magnetic inspection tools is prohibited.  Care must be taken to avoid excessive Shock and Vibration.
 The north-pointing end of a compass needle shall point to the bottom pole (end nearest cathode lead) of the magnetron.
With a total airflow of approximately 35 c.f.m. at approximately 760 mm. Hg., 25°C, divided equally and directed through the cooling fins toward the body of the tube from two ducts placed 1/2 to 1 inch  from the cooling fins, the specified rise above ambient temperature shall not be exceeded.
With a total airflow of approximately 35 c.f.m. at approximately 760 mm. Hg., 25°C, divided equally and directed through the cooling fins toward the body of the tube from two ducts placed 1/2 to 1 inch  from the cooling fins, the specified rise above ambient temperature shall not be exceeded.
Temperature measurements shall be made only after thermal equilibrium has been reached.  The frequency shall be measured at the extremes of any 30°C temperature range. Alternate- Over the specified temperature and frequency ranges, the temperature coefficient shall not exceed the specified limit, for purpose of testing the extreme frequency point will be used.
The tube shall be subjected to five shocks of the specified peak amplitude and duration in each of three mutually perpendicular directions.  Following impact test, the tube shall show no mechanical failure, and shall meet all mechanical, power output, pulse, frequency and voltage requirements of First Article test condition.
The magnetron shall be mounted in a resonance free jig and vibrated with sinusoidal excitation in each of three mutually perpendicular planes through the following amplitudes:
Cycling test:  The frequency shall vary from 5-500-5 Hz with approximately logarithmic progression, and shall require approximately thirty minutes to traverse the range.  This constitutes one cycle.  
The magnetron shall be vibrated for one such cycle in each of the three planes.

Resonance test:  Mechanical resonant frequencies of the magnetron shall be determined during the cycling test.  The tube shall then be vibrated at the indicated resonant conditions for a period of 30 minutes.  If more than one resonant frequency is encountered, the test period may be accomplished at the most severe resonance, or the period may be divided among the resonant frequencies whichever is most likely to produce a failure.

Frequency Modulation measurements during vibration - peak-to-peak frequency deviation shall not exceed the specifications, excluding frequency pushing and thermal drift.  Frequency modulation is defined as inter-pulse frequency changes, commonly know as "Clatter".
The frequency range F1 to F3 shall be traversed by a tuning shaft as stated in maximum block, in some cases mechanical over shall be provided on each end of the tuning range before contacting mechanical stops. No damage shall be caused by contacting the mechanical stops.

The frequency obtained by turning the shaft to a given angular position in one direction shall be reproducible within the specified limits when returning to the same position from the opposite direction after thermal equilibrium.
Operation outside the upper and lower frequency limit is not recommended since permanent tube damage may result.
Caution:   It is important when supplying a D.C. input to the Filament of this tube that the heater terminal be operated negative in polarity w/ respect to the heater cathode terminal.  Failure to observe this precaution may result in permanent damage to the tube.

The solicitation will be issued on or about June 16, 2004 and will be available through the 2.0 Contracts Competency home pages at: https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm

<DESC>NASA/Johnson Space Center (JSC) plans to issue a noncompetitive Request for Proposal (RFP) to Lockheed Martin Space Operations for an extension of up to six months (six one-month options) to the Science, Engineering, Analysis and Test (SEAT) contract (NAS 9-19100), covering the period from January 1, 2005 through June 30, 2005.	It is anticipated that the RFP will be released during the third quarter of calendar year 2004. Extension of the SEAT contract through June 30, 2005 will allow for the continuation of the following engineering and science activities: design, development, fabrication and assembly, and certification of flight hardware; software ground support equipment; performance of structural, thermal, materials, guidance and navigation and control system analysis; development and sustaining engineering of real-time engineering human-in-the-loop simulation systems; performance of research and development in all of the engineering disciplines; performance of earth science research; and performance of photo and television analysis.	In addition, the SEAT contract provides for translation of life science experiments into payloads and integration into space vehicles; crew training and payloads mission management; and maintenance and operation of major engineering test facilities in support of all NASA JSC missions.  Further, the SEAT contractor is responsible for supporting astronaut crews in Earth observing activities including planning, training, cataloging, and analysis.  Authority for the six-month extension comes from a deviation to FAR 17.204(e), NFS 1817.204(e) and NASA Procurement Information Circular 00-22 requirements granted by NASA Headquarters on May 6, 2004. The SEAT contract period of performance is scheduled to end on December 31, 2004.  The Engineering and Science Contract (ESC) competitive procurement schedule provides for contract award on December 16, 2004, followed by a 45-day transition period to facilitate the transition of work to the successor contractor by February 1, 2005.   As a result, there will be no contract coverage for engineering services during the month of January 2005.	 Also, a 45-day transition period may not be sufficient to mitigate technical risks associated with crucial, on-going return-to-flight activities supporting launch in the March-April 2005 timeframe, and critical skills providing support for return-to-flight, including real time mission support and post flight data reduction and analysis, are essential to mission success.  In an effort to mitigate these risks, the current contract will be extended up to 6 months by incorporating six 1-month options.	 The Government does not intend to acquire commercial items using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note “B”. All responsible sources may identify their interest or capability or submit a proposal which shall be considered by the government;  however, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330.  

A CNMP is a grouping of conservation practices and management activities for animal feeding operations (AFOs) which, when implemented as part of a conservation system, will help ensure that both production and natural resource protection goals are achieved. A CNMP incorporates practices to 1) Use animal manure, process wastewater and other organic by-products as a beneficial resource; 2) Address potential impacts of an AFO on natural resources, especially water and air quality; and 3) Assist an AFO owner/operator in meeting all applicable local, Tribal, State, and Federal water quality goals or regulations. NRCS has identified a need to develop up to
250 CNMPs for AFO facilities of EQIP and GLCI program participants over the duration of this project. See Technical Exhibit – Workload for CNMPs, attached, for a breakdown of estimated numbers of CNMPs in each county. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other items and services to provide the service.  The facility locations are distributed throughout Maine.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has issued a solicitation for Letters of Interest  (LOIs) from members of the photovoltaic (PV) community for sustaining support of thin-film PV commercialization, R&D, and continuing National R&D Team activities.  This LOI is in support of NREL’s Thin-Film Photovoltaic Partnership Program (TFPPP).  The purpose of the TFPPP is to accelerate the progress of thin film solar cells and module development as well as to address mid- and long-term research and development issues. The long-term objective of the TFPPP is to demonstrate commercial, low-cost, reproducible, high yield and robust modules having a stable, 15% efficiency. 
	
The purpose of this program is to make progress toward this objective by achieving aggressive interim goals in thin film module efficiencies; cell and module processing; cell and module reliability; and in the technology base that supports these key areas.  Existing NREL-sponsored National R&D Teams will be restructured to support progress of Technology Partners after subcontract awards. All awardees must participate in National R&D Team activities, and an LOI response to this solicitation must indicate acceptance of this condition.  As part of the new direction of the National R&D Teams, Technology and R&D Partners will be required to contribute in new ways:

A. Technology Partners will be required to lead collaborators to address key company issues that support their progress towards improved commercial thin-film PV modules.

B. Research and Development Partners will submit within three (3) new categories, and will be required to include contributions to the progress of Technology Partners. This work may address both short-term issues that, if solved, can enhance the commercial viability of thin film PV modules, as well as longer-term issues improving the performance for future manufacturing schemes.  Corporate and academic responders are expected to contribute to the three categories collectively referred to as R&D Partners, which are: Solar Cell Process Developers (Optimizers), Contributors to Directed Topics, and Specialized Contributors. LOI responses will be separately evaluated and ranked within the four distinct categories, and the budget amounts to be allocated to each category will be determined independently after assessing programmatic requirements.  

Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that three (3) to five (5) Technology Partner subcontracts, up to $ 1million each, three (3) to eleven (11) Solar Cell Process Developer (Optimizer) subcontracts, up to $450,000 each, three (3) to six (6) Directed Topic subcontracts, up to $200,000 each, and six (6) to twenty (20)  Specialized Contributor subcontracts will be awarded as cost-reimbursable, three-year phased subcontracts with annual total funding availability of approximately $10,000,000 (not per award).   Cost sharing from industrial proposers is required at levels specified in the LOI.

Through these conferences, researchers provide the results of their work to other scientists, community leaders and policy makers to promote further research and information exchange. The conference offers the opportunity to examine prevention strategies, those risk factors that are prominent within Native people's cultures, and the relationship of those risk factors with the common cancer sites.  The conference promises to further public health goals related to cancer in Native communities, and will build upon recent progress in cancer projects that have 
been implemented in the past three years. The Mayo Clinic is the lead agency for the five-year, NCI-funded project that supports the Network for Cancer Control Research among American Indian and Alaska Native Populations (aka "Spirit of Eagles"), currently in its fourth year of funding.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice. There is no solicitation available at this time. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) plans to release a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) on or about 11 June 2004. Research and Development is being sought in the area of CBRNE Non-intrusive detection technologies.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The objective is to research and develop non-intrusive detectors capable of providing real-time, non-intrusive interrogation of ordnance, munitions, and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) to detect and identify internal CBRNE components and filler agents.  Desired systems should also have the capability to accurately interrogate container contents for the presence of CBRNE materials regardless of packaging and/or container types, to include items such as pipes and equipment associated with agent production.  The systems being sought will perform CBRNE detection and identification in a complete “non-intrusive” manner, i.e., not requiring physical contact with or exposure to the agent outside of the containment vessel.  The non-intrusive detection systems should be man-portable with a total weight not to exceed 80 lbs (threshold), 30 lbs (objective), and not require or depend upon extensive logistics support for operation.  The systems being sought should be easily upgraded to incorporate technological advances in hardware or software including the ability to detect new analytes.  The systems should be capable of operating within all anticipated environments and should perform with a specificity of 99% (objective) 95% (threshold) with sensitivity comparable to direct detection technologies (objective), 2 logs more than direct detection technologies (threshold).  Specific information regarding the format of submissions, contents, schedules, and evaluation criteria will be provided with the BAA.  The estimated release date for the BAA is 11 June 2004.  This announcement in no way commits the Government to issue a solicitation or make a contract award(s).

Methods should be able to reduce the viability/infectivity of even the most concentrated forms of biological materials, either in wet or dry form, in the presence and absence of contaminating organic and/or inorganic species. The ability to neutralize or render dry materials ineffective is of particular interest.  For chemical materials, methods are required to render toxic chemicals ineffective for their intended use. This may be accomplished either physically or chemically to reduce toxicity, efficacy or otherwise eliminate utility even if retaining some toxic properties.  Methods or materials should be effective regardless of the physical form or the presence of contaminants.  Technologies/destructive materials (for both biological and chemical methods) should be lightweight, easily employed and require minimal or no mixing.  Highly efficient ratios of materials to target, such as those achieved by catalytic materials, are most desired. If mixing is needed to achieve rapid mass transport, provide a theoretical concept to address this requirement. All forms of deactivation will be considered.  Material addition most often requires some means of mixing.  New applications and methods for rapid mixing will be required.  Packages should be robust and lightweight with minimal power requirements.  Interest lay particularly in methods that may be used to mix dry materials. Specific information regarding the format of submissions, contents, schedules, and evaluation criteria will be provided with the BAA.  The estimated release date for the BAA is 11 June 2004.  This announcement in no way commits the Government to issue a solicitation or make a contract award(s).

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently released Business Employment Dynamics (BED) which contains establishment births, closures, contractions and expansions (http://www.bls.gov/bdm/home.htm) and the employment changes by these establishment categories.  BLS plans on shortly having the information available for states, industries and establishment size.  Current data available is establishment (business location) based, not firm based, so methods to develop a small business angle for the research will be necessary.  The data is quarterly going back to 1992 and is available with about a nine month delay.  This data is an improvement over currently available data in that it is quarterly and available with a lag of only 9 months.  These improvements open up interesting timely research angles.  Considering there are few variables associated with the data, other data sources will most likely need to be utilized in research topics.

The Office of Advocacy is interested in industrial organization topics using the BED data.  Potential topics include but are not limited to: the impact of business turnover on the business cycle (and vice versa), the relationship of establishment births and deaths to economic growth, etc.  The possibility exists to obtain special tabulations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics; however costs will be borne by the contractor (and thus should be included in the proposal).  If special tabulations are needed to conduct the research stated in the proposal, the proposal will need to attest that the Bureau of Labor Statistics is willing to create these special tabulations  The duration of this project will be 12 months from the date of award.  The Solicitation document will be posted 6/8/2004.  No other documents will be issued.  THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET A-SIDE.

<SUBJECT>R -- Study Impact of Credit scoring on Lending to Small Firms
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-04-Q-0021
<RESPDATE>072004

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>The use of credit scoring by commercial banks has become more prevalent during the past several years. However, there is concern that the use of credit scoring by commercial banks will exclude small businesses, especially, small businesses in central cities, rural areas, and less advantaged groups from the bank loan market.  Looking at both sides of this issue, many argue that basing loan acceptance primarily on quantitative financial information is too impersonal.  By not allowing for bankers to develop a relationship with potential small business owners through personal interaction, this approach could adversely affect the flow of capital to less advantaged groups.  

However, those who support the use of credit scoring argue that by looking primarily at financial variables, there should be less discrimination based on the “perception” and “subjective attitudes” of the loan officers.  As such, those with the same financials should warrant the same treatment in terms of loan acceptance. Moreover, by reducing the costs of credit review, thus reducing overall administrative costs of small business lending, more loans will be made. The duration of this project will be 12 months from the date of award.  The Solicitation document will be posted 6/8/2004.  No other documents will be issued.  THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET A-SIDE.

<DESC>The Office of Advocacy underwrites and supports database development, production of special tabulations, and research using large databases, in order to improve understanding of small business formation, growth, and survival and major policy issues affecting the survival and growth of small firms. We would like to encourage small business researchers to develop their expertise and interests in some of these databases as well as to share with us any databases that they have developed.
The Office of Advocacy seeks projects that use comprehensive existing databases to add to the state of knowledge about the state of small firms as well as major issues facing small firms.   For an abbreviated list of some data sources for small businesses, see Advocacy’s Academic Frequently Asked Questions (insert URL here).  In addition, research proposals will also be considered that incorporate non-survey methods of obtaining or enhancing public or proprietary data.  Depending on technical merit, policy relevance and costs, the Office may award more than one contract in this topic area. NOTE:  The Solicitation document will be posted on FEDBIZOPS June 8, 2004.  No other documents will be issued.  Provide four (4) copies of your price and technical data.  The duration of this project will be 12 months from the date of award . The latter must be packaged separately.  THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET A-SIDE.

<DESC>This research should take an empirical approach to assessing the differences between rural and non-rural small businesses with regard to various measures of economic growth and performance.  Hypotheses should be developed to address topics such as the number and growth of small business firms, small business employment, business cycle performance, or finance issues dealing with credit availability and capital access, among others.  Analysis of rural small business issues should ideally investigate the differences across the states in small business performance as well as identify differences between rural and non-rural firms.  This approach would integrate an analysis of state policies that affect rural small business development as well as regional differences across the U.S.  Furthermore, the research will ideally identify the part rural small businesses play in state economic growth.  The research proposal should carefully identify data sources and methodology as well as testable hypotheses.  The duration of this project will be 12 months from the date of award.

<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>Fast growth companies are a small percentage of all companies but are often believed to be the engine of growth. While a lot of hype associated with fast growth companies exists, there needs to be more concrete results showing their status and value in the economy.

Research is needed to determine their distribution by industry, at what age they tend to grow, is their growth internal versus acquisition, what percentage of the business population they represent, how they financed their growth, business characteristics and how they fit into our economy (or economic growth).  Equal attention needs to be on fast shrinking firms to determine if these were recent fast growers and do the fast growers essentially net out the fast shrinkers.  Considering much of the results could be based on the definition created to define fast growth, various definitions will be needed to compare how the definition affects the results (growing by an amount within a certain time frame, like doubling or reaching a certain growth level within a certain time frame). 

To conduct this research, a longitudinal database of firms over time with a size indicator(s) needed.  Researchers can procure special tabulations using the Statistics of U.S. Business program at the U.S. Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov/csd/susb/susb.htm) or obtain access to another longitudinal database.  Focusing on venture capital portfolios is another possible datasource, but it is worried that this method would focus too much on the few firms that have growth from initial public offerings.  Data costs will be borne by the researcher and should be reflected in the cost of the proposal.  The duration of this project will be 12 months from the date of award.  The Solicitation document will be posted 6/8/2004.  No other documents will be issued.  THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET A-SIDE.

<DESC>Small business owners are interested in selling their products or services to the government. In many instances, small business owners are interested in stepping in and performing functions previously under the tutelage of the Federal government.  Government outsourcing is governed by at least two important documents: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-76 and Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998 (PL 105-270).

These sources may shed light on the impact of government outsourcing on small business.  For the period 1999-present, for example, are small businesses winning these contracts?   What types of work is being outsourced?  Is there a trend showing that the outsourced work is being bundled?  To what extent, in terms of percentage of total expenditures, has the federal government outsourced to the private sector?   The proposed research should address such issues, but the list presented here is not exhaustive.  This research should include the background information of government outsourcing, literature review of outsourcing history and data information. . NOTE:  The Solicitation document will be posted on FEDBIZOPS June 8, 2004.  No other documents will be issued.  Provide four (4) copies of your price and technical data.  The duration of this project will be 12 months from the date of award . The latter must be packaged separately.  THIS IS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET A-SIDE.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a modification to the above numbered REQUEST FOR INFORMATION to extend the response due date from 15 June 2004 to 30 June 2004.  NAVAIR Lakehurst is seeking potential sources, industry comments and product information for the potential acquisition of a New Organizational level portable Radio Frequency Transmission Line Test Set capable of automatically testing RF transmission lines and RF components of various aircraft installed antennas, coaxial cable, and RF wave-guide paths.  The Test set should also be capable of testing the Radar Warning Receiver systems of the below listed aircraft. This test set will replace the AN/USM-482A (NIIN: 01-390-9170) and the AN/USM-482 (NIIN: 01-211-2836) and the AN/USM-638 (NIIN: 01-399-1757).  The test set will be used to support the AH-1, CH-53, C-130J, EA-6B, E-2C, EP-3E, HH-60, MV-22B, P-3BC, SH-60, S-3B, UH-1 and unmanned aircraft.

Desired Minimum Specifications: Insertion Loss: Measurements Frequency Range - 10 MHz to 18 GHz, Measurement Range - 0 dB to -70 dB (50 Ohm), Measurement Accuracy - +/-1.0 dB or +/- (0.5 + 0.02(F+A)) whichever is greater, where F = Frequency in GHz and A = Attenuation in dB, Measurement Resolution - +/-0.1 dB
Return Loss: Measurement Frequency Range - 10 MHz to 18 GHz, Measurement Range - 1.6 dB to 40 dB (50ohm impedance), Measurement Accuracy - 1.6 dB to 10 dB, +/-1.5 dB, 10 dB to 15 dB, +/-2.5 dB, 15 dB to 17.5 dB, +/-5.5 dB, 17.5 dB to 20 dB, +/-7.5 dB, 20 dB to 40 dB, +/-7.5dB, Measurement Resolution - +/-0.1 dB.     VSWR: Measurement Frequency Range - 10 MHz to 18 GHz, Measurement Range - 1.02:1 (40 dB Return Loss) to 11.1:1 (1.6 dB Return Loss) (50ohm impedance), Measurement Accuracy - Rho to 1.925, 1.925 to 1.43, 1.43 to 1.31, 1.31 to 1.22, Measurement Resolution - +0.1 dB, Distance to Fault: Measurement Range: 0 to 200ft., Measurement Accuracy (<60 dB Insertion Loss), 1.0 GHz bandwidth - +/-6 in (most fault types), 500 MHz bandwidth - +/-1 ft., 50 MHz bandwidth - +/-2 ft, Input Power: 115/220 volts AC, 50, 60 or 400HZ, Warm up Time: 3 minutes typical 

The test set should be capable of automatically or manually testing RF transmission lines, RF components, and microwave components.     The test set should be menu driven.     The test set should be capable of performing Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) testing via Insertion Loss (IL) and Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR). The test set should be capable of testing complete transmission line paths from end to end, from the aircraft Weapons Replaceable Assembly (WRA) to and including the aircraft antennas.     RF transmission line paths tested will include individual coaxial and/or wave-guide transmission lines, connectors, power dividers, RF switches and splitters, and aircraft antennas. The test set should also be capable of generating pulse train patterns that simulate enemy radar transmissions.     The test set should be capable of simulating a multiple threat scenario to test the Radar Warning Receiver in radiated or direct connect mode.     The test set should contain a Built-In-Test (BIT) that automatically does a self test every time the unit is energized and can be operator initiated.
The test set should be of open architecture design with a state of the art control interface.  The test set should provide software download and sweep data recovery capability through the use of a removable memory module or flash card. Leverage of the USM-482 Fault Diagnostic Test Program Instructions (FDTPI) is a plus. Leverage of the USM-638 database is a plus. The test set must be rugged for operating in a flight deck environment on vessel and land based facilities during testing and troubleshooting of these Military aircraft components.     Information is requested on the test sets capabilities to provide testing and troubleshooting of these Aircraft components.     Information is requested on what, if any, cost effective modifications (or suggestions) are necessary to NDI units to meet military environmental requirements. Information is also requested on NDI items ability, or modifications necessary, to meet requirements of MIL-STD-810 (tailored to our requirements) for functional shock, humidity, vibration, transit drop, water resistance, salt fog, solar radiation (minimum), explosive atmosphere (minimum), and expected operating temperature ranges are ?40C to +55C and non-operating ?51C to +71C IAW Mil-Prf 28800F. The unit must meet Mechanical Random vibration requirements IAW MIL-STD-785, Task 301 & Thermal cycling IAW MIL-STD-785, Task 301 (this spec. has been cancelled but will be used as a guide and tailored to our requirements). In addition, the unit must meet EMI requirements of MIL-STD 461D (tailored to our requirements).     The test set will be used in a carrier flight deck environment.
The government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this request for information nor will the government compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information for the government. The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government without written permission in accordance to the legend. It is requested that information be submitted within 30 days after publications of this notice. Any request for copies of solicitations will not be addressed since this is a request for information, not a request for proposal.

3.0	INTRODUCTION, OVERVIEW, OR BACKGROUND

Technical Training Management System (TTMS)
Headquarters Air Education & Training Command
Directorate of Plans & Programs, Requirements, Information Technology (XPRI)
Providing Software Tools For Managing Air Force Technical Training Students


The TTMS utilizes commercial off-the-shelf hardware and software to systematically modernize specific training functions and locations.

It provides a suite of automated tools to manage schoolhouse activities, reporting tools to aid decision makers, and new business practices to maximize efficiency and minimize duplication.

This system supports the following functions:
	
Student Management

Provides training organizations with software tools for training management, student management, scheduling, tracking, and historical reports targeted for all technical training courses within the command.
Also employs related resource scheduling, tracking, and utilization information.

Standardizes student/course management data collection, reporting, and systematically modernized specific training functions.  This phase also provided operational benefits for future implementation phases.

Currently used by over 5,000 faculty members.
Supports approximately 1,800 courses.
Manages over 30,000 new students each year.
Manages Advanced Skill Level Training.
Tracks over 100,000 students annually.


Integrates an automated Instructional System Design (ISD) process with a central database at six training locations.

The course data automatically populates the Student Management data necessary for the student management process.

Customer requests required the development of several course control document templates necessary for course developers.

Reduced course development from 8 – 10 months to 10 – 12 weeks!

Query Capability

Established the need to provide query capability to Training Leadership at all levels.  

Provides the Training Leadership with the necessary access to TTMS production data through a series of pre-defined cubes. 

Evaluation

This phase will modernize and automate the course evaluation process.  The initial deployment is defined as fielding non-TTMS integrated software at the six training locations for Graduate Assessment Surveys (GAS), End-of-Course Critiques and Course Evaluation/Validation.  The final phase will integrate the field evaluation questionnaires and Testing.

Resource Management

This phase will allow users to manage all facets of resource management to include shared utilization of major equipment items, determine equipment utilization rates, and facility utilization.

Employee Management


This phase will provide management insight to instructor qualifications, define instructor-training requirements, and document instructor-training accomplishments.  This will also serve as the instructor’s formal record set.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service is seeking parties who may be interested in perform real estate closing services for the acquistion of conservation easements through out the state of Pennsylvania. Interested parties should express their interest  via regular mail or e-mail by the closing date.

 This request neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. 

The following is the proposed statement of work:

I. OBJECTIVE

The objective of this contract is to retain closing services for acquisitions of wetland easements on behalf of the United States of America, acting by and through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), United States Department of Agriculture, pursuant to Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 3837.

II. BACKGROUND

The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) authorizes the acquisition of easement rights for willing landowners for the purpose of restoring and protecting wetlands. The NRCS is the lead agency within the United States Department of Agriculture charged with administering the program.

III. SCOPE

The Contractor shall furnish all closing services, including obtaining title insurance. The Contractor will perform the same closing services as in a commercial transaction, including disbursement of funds, obtaining deeds, and any necessary curative instruments to assure merchantable insurable title in the name of the United States of America to the wetland easement. The closing services will be performed in the parish/county courthouse of the parish/county in which the wetland easement is located, unless the Contractor and landowner mutually agree to a different location.

IV. STANDARDS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Contractor is responsible for having a current knowledge of the requirements of state law in connection with closing real estate transactions and title clearance. The title insurance company must be on the United States Attorney General’s list of approved companies and must comply with all state laws, including title insurance reserves requirements. The Contractor must be an approved agent licensed to do title insurance business in the State. The title insurance company must be approved by the State Insurance Commissioner. The Contractor will provide evidence of liability insurance coverage for errors and omissions in the amount of at least $1,000,000 and fidelity coverage of at least $500,000 on each individual who will have access to the WRP funds or provide an indemnification agreement from the title insurance for which the Contractor will close the transaction(s) satisfactory to the NRCS providing for reimbursement to NRCS for any loss caused by fraud or dishonest or failure by the attorneys, agents, or employees of the Contractor to comply with NRCS’ written closing instructions. The ALTA Closing Protection Letter Revised 3/27/87 is satisfactory to meet this condition of responsibility. Evidence of liability must be provided prior to contract award.

V. CONFLICT OF INTEREST

A Contractor will not close on a WRP easement purchase for a spouse, children, partners, or business associates, nor have a financial interest in the real estate to be covered by the proposed easement.

VI. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE

A Class D-Boundary survey will be provided to the contractor within 45 days of award. Once the survey is received, the Contractor must obtain the Commitment for Title Insurance. The Contractor shall provide title insurance covering both the easement area and the access area to and from the easement. ALTA U.S. Policy Form 9/28/91 shall be used. The name of the insured on the policy should read: United States of America. The title search will be for a sufficient period of time for the title company to insure the title without objectionable exceptions, and will determine all owners of record, outstanding mortgages, liens, judgments or pending suits, outstanding tax claims, easements or rights of ways of any type, whether oil, gas, and mineral interests have been severed, and any other exceptions that may cloud the title of the easement to be purchased. The Contractor will be required to obtain the execution and recordation, as needed, of such items as Warranty Easement Deed, other deeds, releases, full or partial satisfactions of mortgages, subordinations, lien waivers, affidavits of materialmen liens, child support, and various types of releases of encumbrances on the property. Upon completion, the Contractor will forward the following documents to NRCS:

	Warranty Easement Deed
	Subordination Agreements, if applicable
	Survey, original and one copy for DC
	Title Commitment, original and one copy for DC
	Invoice
	Other documentation as required.

The Contractor will submit the above preliminary package to the Contracting Officer not later than 10 business days from receipt of the survey plat. The Contractor will also include a copy of the invoice for the title insurance premium. The Contractor will forward one copy of the title commitment to the local District Conservationist (DC). Upon receipt of the required documents, NRCS will obtain from its Office of General Counsel (OGC) a Preliminary Title Opinion (PTO) which will set out any exceptions to the title. OGC will determine which exceptions are acceptable and which exceptions must be cured. The Contractor will not close any transaction or record deeds or other instruments prior to receiving the PTO.

At this time, NRCS will process the landowner’s easement payment along with payment for the title insurance expense. On receipt of the PTO, the Contractor will be required to close the transaction at a place mutually satisfactory to the Contractor and landowner within 10 business days of receipt of payments. The Contractor will not close any transaction until funds are received. The Contractor will close the transaction, record the deeds and other instruments as necessary and insure that the following have occurred:

1. No new encumbrances have been recorded against the subject property since the date of the title commitment.
2. Receipt, execution, and recordation of the Warranty Easement Deed from the landowner.
3. Delivery of the policy of title insurance referred to below.
4. All exceptions required to be removed, released, subordinated, waived or otherwise handled as set forth
in the Preliminary Title Opinion from the Office of the General Counsel have been completed and the applicable clearance documents recorded. Complete the closing checklist from OGC.
5. All taxes, assessments, etc., are paid to the date that the Warranty Easement Deed is recorded.
6. Furnish a Final Title Policy in an insured amount which is the same as the consideration paid for the wetland easement. The Final Title Policy shall be on ALTA U.S. Policy Form 9/28/91 and will be issued by a title insurance company that is on the Attorney General’s approved list.
7. Comply with any listed title commitment or binder requirements.
8. Prepare/submit IRS Form 1099-S for all easement payments.

If any new encumbrances have been recorded against the subject property since the date of the title commitment, the Contractor will immediately notify the Contracting Officer (CO) and will not proceed until further instructions are received. Upon completion of the closing, the Contractor will send to NRCS the U.S. Policy Form 9/28/91, naming the United States of America as the insured, in the amount of the purchase price as of the date and time of recording of the Warranty Easement Deed to the United States of America. The policy of title insurance will be free and clear of any and all encumbrances (exceptions) to the title except those shown as acceptable in the OGC Preliminary Opinion. At the time of closing, the Contractor will provide a Settlement Statement to the landowner, in the form similar to HUD-1 (8-87) RESPA, HB 4305.2.

The Contractor will return the package, to the Contracting Officer and one copy to the local DC within five business days following closing. The package shall include the following:

	1. The invoice covering the agreed upon closing cost.
	2. Policy of title insurance (original and one copy).
	3. The original recorded copy and one copy of the Warranty Easement Deed to 	the United States of America.
	4. The original and (one copy to landowner) of the settlement statement.

<DESC>C-130 Aerial Spray High Pressure Spray System (HPSS) Request for Information (RFI)

This is a request for information and not a solicitation.

INTRODUCTION:

The Government is interested in obtaining information concerning the C-130 Aerial Spray HPSS.  This program includes efforts to design, develop, manufacture, install and test one C-130 Aerial Spray HPSS and deliver three additional systems.  The Department of Defense Pest management board has determined the need for a high pressure spray system to be used on the C-130 aircraft.  All manufactures that propose a bid to design and build the high pressure system must have a Federal Aviation Administration certificate that certifies the company to design and build equipment that will be used on airborne aircraft. The vendor must also comply with all military specifications on material used in the system. Upon completion of the effort all designs, drawings and proprietary rights to the project will be relinquished and turned over to the United States Air Force.

SCOPE:

This request for information is directed to competitive potential prime contractors who have demonstrated experience in the design, development, integration, and test of aircraft modifications.  The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to refine the strategy for the development of the C-130 Aerial Spray High Pressure Spray System.  Further, this information will help the Government structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule and performance risks.  

OBJECTIVES:  

The main objectives in this project are as follows:
1.	Design and build 4 ea. high pressure spray systems with multiple subassemblies capable of being installed and removed from a standard 463L military cargo pallet.
2.	Produce one trial install kit for operational and flight testing prior to producing the final three systems.
3.	The system must be capable of producing flow rates from 1 gallon per minute to 5 gallons per minute at pressures of 1000 – 2500 pounds per square inch (PSI).
4.	The system must have the capability to utilize existing low pressure Modular Aerial Spray System (MASS) power outlets and boom cradle assembly currently installed on spray modified C-130 aircraft.
5.	The system must be capable of incorporating many design features and components found on existing MASS systems.
6.	The system must be capable of holding a minimum of 200 gallons of chemical
with a desired capacity of 300 gallons.
7.	The system sub-assemblies will be designed and installed as not to exceed maximum PSI rating for the cargo pallet.
8.	The system must produce 80% of it’s droplets in the 7 – 22 micron range.

HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM ASSEMBLY: 

The basic assembly of the high pressure system will consist of the following:
1.	Modified 463L military cargo pallet
2.	200-300 gallon chemical tank sub-assembly
3.	Operators control console sub-assembly
4.	Pumping unit sub-assembly
5.	Pneumatic pump
6.	Tank sub-assembly 

SUB-ASSEMBLIES:

1.	Standard 463L Cargo Pallet:  The standard 463L cargo pallet will be modified as follows: Pallet will have a three inch tall drip pan installed over the entire surface of the pallet. The drip pan will be constructed of 316 stainless steel with all seams welded. All other sub assemblies will fit down inside the drip pan in an effort to prevent any possible contamination to the aircraft. All side strap/net rings will be removed, rings on forward and aft ends of pallet as installed will remain in place. The 463L pallets are manufactured by the Brooks & Perkins Corp.  No pallet procurement is required; they will be furnished as Government Furnished Property (GFP).

2.	Chemical Storage Tank:  The chemical storage tank will be manufactured utilizing either a polypropylene or 316 stainless steel material. Material composition of tank is of utmost importance as various chemical compounds will be used. Bottom of tank must be situated above floor of the pallet on a cradle and will have a 3 gallon sump area in the center.  The sump outlet should be above or even with pump inlet. Tank must be designed and manufactured so as to withstand chemical weights up to 18 lbs per gallon and must also be able to withstand a gravitational force of 5g’s. Tank should be designed with internal baffles that will slow/reduce fluid movement. Tank will have a minimum capacity of 200 gallons with a desired capacity of 300 gallons. Tank must be capable of being installed and removed on the pallet using locking devices that will restrain tank movement in all directions. Tank must have access plates installed that will allow access for internal cleaning. Tank must have a 16 AN fitting installed at top of tank to enable the connection of overboard vent hose. Tank must incorporate a suction valve like that of the one contained on current MASS system. This eliminates possibility of implosion and allows for continuous purge during flight. Tank must have outlet to pump unit at bottom of sump and must have recirc and over pressurization lines on the top. Tank must incorporate both visual and electrical measuring devices that show amount of liquid inside. Tank must have a 1 ½” upload download port/dry break adapter to enable power filling and draining.

3.	Operators Control Console:  The operators console shall be designed to control all operations of the high pressure system. The console will incorporate a flat screen multifunction control panel. The panel will be touch screen design and capable of controlling all valves, quantity, flow and pressure readouts. The panel will also have  toggle type switches off to the side that will be used as an emergency shutdown for entire system and motor control. The console will also incorporate adequate lighting for all areas and an additional light that can be adjusted over the work area of console. The console will be designed so as to allow for installation of an operators seat that will be removed from a MASS unit and installed on the high pressure system. The entire console will be based on design as the one used on the MASS, however, it will be smaller and designed specifically for the high pressure system. The console sub assembly will also house all main wiring and circuit breakers. All wiring connectors will be of the cannon type connectors. Console unit will have 2 external cannon type plugs on left side that will be switched. They will feed power to the MASS ground loading station. Console will have a clear splash guard around upper perimeter to protect operator. Console will be designed so as to allow for easy installation and removal from the 463L pallet assembly. Locking devices used to hold the console in place must be such to prevent the console from movement in all directions.

4.	Pumping Unit:  The pumping unit will contain all the main operating components. These components are, but not limited to, (1) a 5 hp 220 volt motor as used on the MASS and (2) a high pressure low volume pump or pumps producing flow rates from 1-5 gallons per minute at pressures up to 2500 psi. The pump must utilize viton or Teflon o-rings for any internal sealing. Pump must have the capability to be rebuilt in the field and repair kits must be available to the user. The pumping unit will have the capability to re-circulate liquids back to the chemical tank when not in spray mode and must have an over pressure safety design so as in the event of an over pressurization the pressure will drop and recirc back to the chemical tank. Unit will incorporate a 2-way pneumatic valve to enable the system to rapidly change from spray to recirc mode. The spray lines from the 2-way valve outboard will have the capability of being air purged with air from pneumatic bottle. The spray lines must be manufactured using 316 stainless steel or a Teflon lined braided stainless steel capable of withstanding system pressures plus 50%.  The components will be designed in such a way that they will be inside a containment box by themselves. The unit will be manufactured using 316 stainless steel in order to eliminate any corrosion problems. Unit will have outlets for spray lines and applicable cannon type electrical connectors for wiring. The box for unit will also incorporate a cover to avoid possible contamination of aircraft in the event of a leak. The cover will incorporate stainless steel and a lexan type window so as to afford the operator a view into the box without opening the cover. The cover must be removed and installed by mechanics with relative ease. The pumping unit as a whole will have the capability to be installed and removed from the 463L pallet. Locking devices used to hold the pumping unit in place on the pallet must be such to prevent the unit from movement in all directions.

5.	Pneumatic Pump:  A compressor type pump will be installed on the unit. Compressor should have a receiver and have the capability to maintain a constant supply of air at rates from 40 to 150 psi. In the event this is not possible the following storage tank will be acceptable.

6.	Storage Tank:  The pneumatic storage tank will have the capacity to hold 115 cubic feet of air and serviced to 1800 psi. The tank will be of same type and size as currently used on the MASS. The tank will have the capability of being serviced while in place on the High Pressure pallet. Tank air flow will be through a pneumatic regulator in order to regulate flow from 40 to 150 psi. Tank may be mounted to any previously mentioned sub-assembly so long as its location does not interfere with the maintenance or servicing of the other sub-assemblies when installed. Tank air must have capability of being routed both for pneumatic valves and air purging of spray lines with minimal operator action required. Lines from tank to purge will incorporate a check valve so as not to contaminate the air line when not in use.

<DESC>PURPOSE OF RFI
The purpose of this RFI is to identify existing systems and solutions to utilize the Government Smart Card (GSC) platform.  This is not a request for proposal (RFP).  We are looking for information regarding the types of solutions and services available on a national scale.  The FPS is looking to define and identify open architecture systems and technical solutions  capable of meeting the project's functional requirements. 

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
To provide the government with an integrated process for employees to identify and authenticate themselves, before being given access to government systems, and facilities all within a secure process.  For those areas with more discerning security needs, the use of digital signatures and/or biometrics may be used to provide additional security for access control or other forms of electronic transactions.
 
BACKGROUND
The Federal Protective Service has been designated to provide physical security protection at all Federal Buildings.  This encompasses approximately 13,000 GSA owned or leased locations in the U.S.

These buildings are located throughout the United States and its territories. A large portion of these existing locations have physical Access Control (AC) systems, however, the systems are not connected to one existing card AC system that uses the existing GSA Global/Wide/Local Area Network (G/W/LAN).  Each of these systems will need to have an interface panel installed and have assigned/static TCP/IP addresses assigned for the control panels in each location.  The systems must work in conjunction with the facilities contract security officer guard services that physically inspect and observe building entry.

CURRENT AND PROJECTED PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEMS
FPS intends to adopt a multi-application Smart Card (SC) that will support a broad range of Government-wide and agency-specific services such as personal identification, property accountability, physical and logical network access, and other administrative functions.  The national SC program must meet the current requirements of the Government Smart Card (GSC) Interoperability Specifications (IS).

The supplied Computer server for this project shall be mirrored and located in two of the four Mega Centers (MC) with real time connectivity to the other two MC servers.  These 4 MCs then serve FPS and their districts in supporting the Federal Community.

A TCP/IP address and an Ethernet connection (to the GSA and/or DHS G/W/LAN) will be provided by the government to all these locations.  The system shall incorporate as much of the existing technology or legacy systems, in whole or part as is feasible for a successful project.  (E.g.: Incorporate the use of existing Motorola Indala card readers and Motorola ASP cards, HiD, etc., but eventually all legacy systems will be upgraded to incorporate or be replaced by the GSC Initiative.

The solution shall integrate all existing cardholder profiles, as they exist at the time of installation to the government's Human Resources (HR) pre-populated database.  Connection between readers, data gathering panels, smart panels and server, which use the G/W/LAN, shall be encrypted and alarmed to ensure secure system integrity.

The central card management system (CCMS) shall allow multiple Domain administrators, each controlling members of their own Domain but not members of other Domains.  Each Domain administrator shall be able to create reports, view statistics and have full administrative rights to their respective domains.  The CCMS will also allow for setting of multiple levels of security.  For example:  restricting nonessential personnel during times of emergencies.

Interested parties are requested to submit marketing packages and technical information in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the products and services being offered for consideration. Information should be sent to the following address: Department of Homeland Security, Federal Protective Service, Attn: Peter J. Andrews, 200 Chestnut Street, Suite 356, Philadelphia, PA  19106.  Any question should be submitted by e-mail to: peter.andrews@dhs.gov.  The information is due no later than COB, June 17, 2004.

<DESC>This is a Market Survey conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center.  The NIH Clinical Center has interest in seeking sources capable of providing a Medical Intelligence Application with the capability of integrating all required data of a Health Care Institution into one HIPAA compliant format. 

The Government system requirements are specified herein. FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS: The application must be able to combine data from multiple source databases such that users need not be aware of the system of origin of the data, and the system must contain explicit rules to combine records from multiple sources transparently into one “virtual record.” The application must be able to accept source data in coded formats, including but not limited to Rich Text Format (RTF), Portable Document Format (PDF), and Extensible Markup Language (XML). The application must be able to aggregate data based on criteria including but not limited to subject, clinical research protocol, institute or owner of that protocol, and coded diagnosis. The application must contain data visualization tools to allow the characterization of aggregate data by arbitrary variable including but not limited to age, sex, location of subject residence, prior diagnosis, and race/ethnicity. The application must be able to present data in multiple formats, including but not limited to scatter graphs, bar charts, and tables or lists. The application must provide the ability to “drill down” from aggregate displays such as graphs to individual records by both sequential graphical selection and refinement of query criteria. The application must use a security model than can limit access based on user, user role, user institutional affiliation, subject, subject clinical research protocol, and subject institutional affiliation. The security model must be able to limit access at the individual data field level. The application must support mapping of data to standard vocabularies/ontologies/coding sets specified by the Federal Consolidated Health Informatics initiative, including but not limited to LOINC, SNOMED CT, and RxNorm. The application must provide support for both predesigned and “ad hoc” queries, and must include at least a query tool that allows construction, storage, and resubmission of queries without knowledge of Structured Query Language (SQL), a tool that allows the submission of well formed SQL queries directly, and a tool that checks queries for predicted performance impact on the application. In addition to standard SQL queries, the application must support queries based on the representation of time, e.g. return all subjects with test result X within 6 months of diagnosis Y. The application must provide management tools to assign and manage access permissions at the levels described above. The application must support storage, display, and analysis of multiple data types, including but not limited to continuous variables (laboratory test results, age), discrete variables (sex, race/ethnicity), grouped variables (age range), relationships (pedigrees), and pointers (to images). The application must be extensible to accommodate new data types as standards for representation of these data types become available. Such data types may include genomic sequence data, gene expression data, protein activity data, and profiles of single nucleotide polymorphisms. The application must allow creation of matched aggregate data sets for statistical comparison, including on-the-fly construction of control groups based on user-defined variables, and the application must provide basic statistical tools for comparison across groups. The application must provide tools for natural language processing, including but not limited to ability to search text documents by word or regular expression, and the ability to qualify searches based on negation or proximity of terms. The application must be fully compliant with relevant security privacy regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the privacy act. Such compliance must include at least full audit trails for record access, both in aggregate and as individual records, and the ability to mask identifiers in retrieved records to the extent required by regulation. The application must explicitly support both unmasked retrievals for queries approved by a Privacy Board, Institutional Review Board (IRB) or equivalent, or masked queries for preliminary hypothesis generation/data exploration. TECHNICAL (ARCHITECTURAL) CHARACTERISTICS: The application must be designed using a three-tiered architecture that separates the data store, the business logic, and the presentation layer. The application must support operation of the presentation layer on the following client platforms: Windows, including releases from 98 to XP, MacOS X versions 10.1 through 10.3, and Linux. Such support may be provided either natively or through a third-party product such as Citrix. If support is provided through a third-party product, the application must still meet all performance requirements and the respondent is responsible for providing a reasonable configuration to meet such requirements. If the data store is hosted  on a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), it must be an RDMS already in use at the NIH Clinical Center, such as Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, or Oracle. The data store and middleware must run on an operating system already in use at the NIH Clinical Center, such as Microsoft Windows 2000 or XP, MacOS X Server, Solaris, or AIX. The application must provide an Application Programming Interface (API) or other standard and well-defined interface to be used by other systems to access data within the “virtual record.” All data passed between the application tiers must be encrypted. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS: The application must have a well defined average query-to-response time under normal load. Application performance must be scalable, and performance degradation with increasing data store size must be correctable with reasonable augmentation of hardware. The application must not require scheduled periods of unavailability (down time) of more than 2 hours per week, and must not require unscheduled down time of more than 2 hours per month. BUSINESS CHARACTERISTICS: The respondent must demonstrate existing or past use of the application in a health care setting in the United States or abroad, and must demonstrate existing or past use of the application to support clinical research.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement only, and your response is not an offer.  All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary.  The Government will not pay for the information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in the preparation or submission of industry responses.  Solicitations are not available at this time, and as such any requests for solicitations will not receive a response.

Interested parties that believe they have the performance capability required should send supporting information that documents that belief.  The Government would like to review descriptive literature and pricing as part of this market research to determine interest and capability of potential sources for this requirement.  The information provided need not be excessive in length, but should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate that your company understands the nature of work involved, and has the expertise and resources to successfully perform.  

The NAIC and small business size thresholds for this requirement are respectively, 541512 and 21.0 million dollars in annual receipts of a concern which has been in business for three or more fiscal years.  Responding companies should indicate whether they consider themselves a large or small business for the purpose of this requirement.  Those Contractors which hold GSA schedule contracts are requested to submit a copy of the applicable GSA contract as part of their response.  

Responses are requested by June 25, 2004.  Please address responses to Julius Y. Tidwell, Contracting Officer, National Institutes of Health, Office of Purchasing and Contracts, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Suite 106M, Mail Stop Code 5480, Bethesda, Maryland  20892-5480 or via e-mail to jtidwell@cc.nih.gov.

<SUBJECT>R -- Multi-Int Fused Imagery Initiative
<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with Concurrent Technologies Corporation for a base year and 4 option years.  

This effort will involve the establishment of a Multi-Int Fused Imagery (MIFI) foundation capability.  This capability will allow for the integration, storing, and retrieval of collected imagery data, which will, eventually, be assessed and fused.  Utilizing improved markup languages (ex. XML, GML), incorporating image tagging, pointers, and rapidly developing web technologies suggest there are ways available to provide MIFI data (raw, target and collection) to customers in near real time.

Creation of a multidimensional information space around the image with fused relevant data will transform how data is viewed.  Envisioned are multiple representations of each fused image, for different purposes, used by various end users.    

This effort will require working in a sensitive, compartmented environment.

All current CNRSE FSC service providers are invited.  CNRSE has Navy activities in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee, and South Carolina.  

It is anticipated that approximately 40 to 50 participants from government and industry will attend.  The forum will be a one-day event that will include the full spectrum of CNRSE FSC service providers as well as key government representatives in the FSC program and acquisition functions.  Information and ideas of interest to this group will be shared with the intent of improving the general understanding of the 1) changing resource environment, 2) processes and approaches that may be used to balance resources with requirements and, 3) related issues and concerns from the government and contractor perspective.  These three themes will be central to the government/industry exchange at the forum.  Discussion of specific contract actions or procurements in progress will be limited, as needed, to appropriately preserve procurement integrity and business sensitive information.  Otherwise, we welcome an open exchange and we are very interested in having you participate and share your views.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The contractor responds in person by the afternoon of the same business day of the maintenance call if contacted by phone, fax or e-mail before 8am or the contractor responds in person to MSC by noon of the following business day if contacted after 8am.

Standard: The contractor provides normal replacement items (i.e. fixer rollers and other typical parts requiring periodic replacement) and supplies such as toner, and returns the printer to satisfactory service during the initial visit.

If the delay is due to unavailability of replacement parts or supplies, the contractor must provide proof of unavailability along with a proposed schedule for returning the printer to satisfactory service.  If the parts are so rare that they cannot be obtained in a timely manner, MSC has the option to remove the printer from the maintenance agreement and receive a pro-rata credit of the price of the warranty as applicable to the printer in question for the remainder of the warranty period.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the purchase of two  Redlake ES 4.0/E digital cameras.  These cameras must be customizable to operate under low pressure environments (less than one-tenth of an atmosphere).  The specific requirements are as follows: ITEM 1:  2 ea. Redlake ES 4.0/E digital cameras, 2048 x 2048 interline transfer CCD sensor, LVDS output. C-mount option. ITEM 2: 2 ea. 100-foot cable compatible to NI 1428 frame grabber boards, subsequent pixel clock tuning for each camera and cable combination ITEM 3: This model of camera has three components to its body: two end caps with perforations to permit cooling fans to draw air through the electronics and a square "tube" which contains most of the electronics. New endcaps need to be designed and fabricated. These new endcaps must seal the electronics but also allow for an external source of cooling air. The front cap must have a window and must be thick enough to accommodate the one atmosphere pressure differential. The aperture must be large enough to accommodate Schiempflug focusing, or no less than the current aperture of the standard C-mount.The front cap must have an air fitting to permit the cooling air into the camera body. The cooling air source will be dried "shop air". The back cap must permit sealed connections of three cables: the camera signal cable, the synchronization cable and the power cable. The back cap must have an air fitting to permit the cooling air to vent to the atmosphere outside the pressure vessel.   This customization of the cameras will be needed for the two new cameras and two cameras (the same model) currently in use (total of four).

It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to procure equipment and labor to upgrade NIH existing C-Cure 1 Plus access control and security alarm monitoring systems located at Rockledge Drive in Bethesda, MD.  Some panels need to be replaced and/or upgraded to the newer apC/8X with the latest firmware.  The following equipment, materials, and labor as stated below.  There are a total of twenty four (24) panels at NIH, eighteen (18) panels will be upgraded, and six (6) panels remain as is.  The materials, description, and quantity are needed as follows: (1) 1 system - C-Cure 800/30 Bundled System includes 8 client license; (2) 1 each - Dell PC for Access Control System (Window 2000); (3) 18 each - apC panels upgrades to apC/8X 1MB Panel; (4) 1 fee - C-Cure 1 data conversion and input to the new C-Cure 800; (4) 1 fee - Installation, Programming, Testing, Training, Technical Support, Materials.  The alarm system has automatic monitoring capabilities, no additional monitoring will be required.  Network:  Due to the limitation of straight copper between the facilities and ApC chains are full to capacity, install Multiplexing units as well as port expander units, just to facilitate the system growth throughout the buildings.  By putting the new CCure 800 system on the NIH network all of the hardwired equipment will be able to be removed and change the system into a true-networked Access Control System, expanding the flexibility now and in the future.  The integration with the network will also allow the elimination of the Verizon phone circuits to other buildings (i.e. Warehouse, 6011, etc.), which would eliminate the monthly charge for those circuits.  Modem:  This modem offers the NIH two benefits.  (1) It will allow NIH access into the CCure 800/30 machine via phone line if the NIH remote network connectivity is not working. (2) It will allow the Facility Manager capability to dial into the system to perform programming functions and help with programming problems.  In addition, it will allow technical support personnel and project managers ability to dial into the system when a Facility Manager is not available to perform programming changes so NIH personnel can remain secure and protected.  The NIH has scheduled a site visit to review the performance site.  The site visit is on Thursday, June 10, 2004 from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made.  For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price, with past performance being considered equal to price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as required delivery dates, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.
            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal, who meets the government’s required delivery dates, will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
