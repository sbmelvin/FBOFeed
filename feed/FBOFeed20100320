<DESC><p>This is the solicitation associated with Presolicitation Notice HSFEHQ-10-R-0039 posted on 22 February 2010. This Synospsis/Solicitation is labeled HSFEHQ-10-R-0039(RFP) so as to distinguish from the Presolicitation Notice. In all correspondence, the correct reference shall be HSFEHQ-10-R-0039 for this Solicitation.<br /><br />Questions from all interested parties will be entertained through 3:00 PM, Eastern Time, Friday, March 26, 2010. (see pages L-3 and L-4).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Risk Reduction Division (RRD) of FEMA's Mitigation Directorate requires Programmatic Technical Assistance (PTA) in applying and maintaining FEMA's Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) Tool . State, Local and Tribal Governments frequently request grants to assist in mitigating loss of life and property due to natural and manmade disasters. The FEMA BCA Tool was developed to establish a consistent, uniform automated tool developed to assess the benefits flowing from the proposed grant relative to the cost of the grant. The contractor would also be required to maintain BCA Tool, enhance it as required and to teach the application of the tool to key stakeholders. <br />Additionally, RRD is seeking the development and implementation of a Loss Avoidance National Tool (LANT). A LANT will assess effectiveness of previously issued grants by capturing the avoidance of life and property loss due to grant implementation. Such analyses are not new; however, a uniform, automated approach is required to reduce analysts' effort and to provide a consistent methodology. The Contractor would also be responsible for training development and instruction for key stakeholders. Technical communication of the tool, its application and installation is part of the requirement.<br />The Contractor would also provide expert advice, guidance, and recommendations to modernize and streamline grants program business processes and services for FEMA's RRD. Further, the Contractor would provide assistance to improve the quality of RRD technical reports. The Contractor would also provide expert advice on loss avoidance, benefit-cost analysis and other mitigation projects on an as needed basis. There is a requirement that the Contractor provide expert support and advice on programmatic information analysis. This analysis will include quantitative and qualitative analyses and will utilize Geographical Information System (GIS) and spatial analysis related tools.<br /><br />See the Statement of Objectives at Section C of the attached Solicitation for the full requirements statement.</p>
