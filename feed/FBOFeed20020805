<DESC>This synopsis advertises a Commercial Item requirement for "turn-key" data routing and retrieval (DR&R) telecommunications services; hereafter, the Converged POES/DMSP Telecommunications Contract (CP/DT).  These services will be notionally comprised of discrete firm-fixed-price (FFP) point-to-point "circuit" unit prices.  The term "turn-key" is defined as comprising the satellite uplink (e.g., ground station facilities and associated electronics), the communications satellite (SATCOM) transponders, and the satellite downlink to users either directly or through a teleport facility, including all equipment necessary at the users' site. These DR&R services will support the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) data dissemination mission.  The NOAA is a bureau of the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC).  NOAA's mission for data dissemination hereunder includes but is not necessarily limited to data acquired from the Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) and the Department of Defense's Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) systems.   Optional circuits will include priced circuits for METEOSAT/GMS and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) GOES-9.  The NOAA contract will be managed by the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS)/Integrated Program Office (IPO), an office under the DOC/NOAA, National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Services (NESDIS).  Contract award is planned for July 8, 2002.  The effective date of operations will be no later than September 6, 2002.  Between award and the operational effective date the Contractor will be testing circuits and ensuring a transparent phase-over to this successor contract.  The POES and DMSP's telecommunication services are currently acquired through DISA/DITCO, Scott AFB, IL, Contract DCA200-96-C-0047.  The maximum term envisioned for this contract is 10 years, which includes a Base Period of up to 36 months, and a succession of unilateral options of two-three years duration.   This solicitation is being conducted in accordance with Public Law 103-355 (41 U.S.C. 264 note), and the information below is expressed as a statement of need for a commercial item, as outlined in FAR 12.202. This acquisition exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, and will be procured IAW Part 15.  The intent of this synopsis is to describe the required commercial items through the process described in FAR subpart 11.002. The Government further intends to use streamlined procedures to the extent practicable.  Part of the intent of this notice is to identify any appropriate commercial practices.  Additionally, it is the intent of NOAA to tailor the provision of FAR 52.212-1 and 52.212-4 to include addenda to the terms, estimated to include: indefinite quantity & indefinite delivery ordering; performance and quantity options; financing provisions, if applicable; progress reporting requirements; inspection and acceptance; and incentive provisions-if applicable to commercial practices.  A 150% optional quantity above the priced value is within the scope of this contract's ordering authority.  Minimum performance requirements are as follows: Bit Error Rate (BER) of 10-8;circuit delay of 600 milliseconds; and data availability of 99.5%.  Conceivably these requirements can be measured, quantified and potentially induced using positive and negative incentives.  Data quality, timeliness and availability are paramount objectives for the user at the DR&R destination.  It is presumed that DR&R data will flow by domestic satellite (DOMSAT) channels, at least for the Base period.  It is envisioned that a future architecture could include fiber optic channels, which will be considered if proposed for a future technology infusion plan that demonstrates capacity for accomplishment of the mission at decreased cost and improved technical efficiency. Data rate capacities will be listed as priced circuit links, and described in the documents described below.  IN RE: AVAILABILITY OF SPECIFICATIONS, PLANS, DRAWINGS, AND OTHER TECHNICAL DATA?it is impractical to distribute the applicable performance specifications with the solicitation. These documents may be examined at the originating office, by notifying the POC, or obtained by sending an electronic mail request with full address and contact data to jay.moore@noaa.gov with a reference to ''CP/DT Performance Specifications''.  An RFP is anticipated for release o/a April 24, 2002, with a Pre-solicitation conference o/a May 1, 2002.  IMPORTANT!! Those interested in this requirement should contact Mr. Jay W. Moore, NPOESS/Integrated Program Office, 8455 Colesville Road, Suite 1450, Silver Spring, MD 20910; Tel. 301-427-2126, ext. 112, and provide full contact information.  Requests by e-mail and letter will be honored with a rapid reply containing a description and diagrams of the requirements synopsized above.

The OPS has three modules as follows: (1) Take Off & Landing Performance; (2) Emergency Return Calculation; and (3) Ground Weight & Balance Determination.  As a Minimum the software must be capable of: (4) Determining zero fuel; (5) takeoff weight; (6) ramp weight and takeoff center-of-gravity for multiple flights concurrently based on aircraft-specific parameters and environmental conditions; (7) Maintain a history of all calculations performed by each user; (8) Capture closeout times; (9) fuel quantities; (10)  CG trends and data on specific loads for management analysis. The software must also make it possible to: (11) Maximize allowable takeoff and landing weight; (12) improve engine reliability and reduce maintenance costs by calculating optimum takeoff thrust; (13) eliminate/minimize requirement for paper-based information;  (14) calculate emergency return-to-base profile based on real-time information; (15) reduce training costs thought a common graphical interface across different type/model/series aircraft; (16) customize the output for organizational-specific requirements ( forms, procedures etc.); and (17) operate in a network environment. Note: This software is proprietary and available only from Spirent Systems. The SIC Code is 7371 and the NAICS Code is 541511. All interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirement.

Attention is directed to DFARS Clause 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Effective 1 June 98 contractors must have registered in the C CR database.

If not already registered, on-line instructions and registration are available by visiting t he website at http://ccr.edi.disa.mil. The Corps of Engineers (COE) is responsible for effectively implementing the small business programs withi n its activities, including achieving program goals, and ensuring that contracting and technical personnel maintain knowledge of Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women-owned small business program requirements, and taking all reasonable actions to increase participation in its small business activities. In line with the emphasis on this program, the COE, New York District is particularly desirous of increasing subcontracting opportunities for Small business concerns, Small Disadvantaged business concerns and  Women-owned small business concerns. You, as a prime contractor, are required to participate in this program by soliciting subcontractor bids from such firms. In addition to locating simply small business sources, you are encouraged to take action to loca te competent Small Disadvantaged and Women-owned small business concerns for your subcontracting opportunities in preparing your offer. You are further urged to request such sources in the vicinity in which the work is to be performed. In addition, it is s uggested that you contact the local SBA Minority Enterprise Development (MED) staff to obtain SBA’s certified listing of socially and economically disadvantaged business concerns in the vicinity in which the work is to be performed. Therefore, the followin g instructions and provisions apply to this solicitation:  The successful offeror, if a large business, must submit a subcontracting plan within five (5) working days of notification of selection. The subcontracting plan must be in conformance with all asp ects of FAR Subpart 19.7.  A contract will not be awarded unless and until the Contracting Officer has determined (with advice from SBA) that the offeror’s subcontracting plan provides maximum practicable opportunities for Small, Small Disadvantaged and Wo men-owned Small Business concerns to participate in contract performance. In determining the acceptability of a proposed subcontracting plan the Contracting Officer will evaluate all relevant factors inclusive of an offeror’s past performance with respect to the offeror’s having awarded subcontracts for the same or similar products or services to Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-owned small business concerns.  In order to make this evaluation, the offeror is required to submit its past SF 294 (Subcontra cting Report For Individual Contracts) and SF 295 (Summary Subcontract Report) forms along with its offer. Subcontracting plans will be evaluated to ensure compliance with solicitation requirements and the public law.  PRIOR to award, the successful offero r will be required to discuss its subcontracting plan with the Small And Disadvantaged Business Utilization Specialist (the “SADBUS”), the Contracting Officer, the Source Selection Authority and the SBA.

The expected duration of this project is two weeks after date of contract award.  The FAA has determined that only Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) is the single source that can perform these upgrades because of the following reasons: (1) The current database employed by the Pegasys 1000 is proprietary. (2) JCI is familiar with the Pegasys application and the JCI hardware as it is implemented at the Technical Center, and (3) The process of evaluating vendors who may claim the ability of providing this service will jeopardize the current construction and security initiatives' timely completions. <P>

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research, Laboratory of Pathology(LP) intends on entering into a sole source contract with LC Packings, 80 Carolina Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94103 for UltiMate fully integrated nanoLCsystem with Famos cool micro autosampler, switch os micro column device and pro bot fraction collector.  The LP studies protein expressions in cell populations of tissues which are the most pertinent to analyze.  Characterization of cellular proteins in a high-throughput manner similar too diagnostic testing routinely employed at hospitals and clinical reference laboratories could be used for disease monitoring, prognosis, treatment strategy, and identification/staging. Laser Capture Micro dissection (LCM) has been developed in the LP to provide a rapid, reliable method to procure pure specified cells from specific microscopic regions of tissue sections for subsequent quantitative, multiplex molecular analysis. The LP has been developing technologies for using micros dissected cell total proteins for mass spectrometric or array based micro analysis.  Traditionally, Proteomics has its origin in the technology of two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis.  In 2D-PAGE proteins are separated in one dimension by its charge and the other by its molecular weight.  Despite its high resolution power, this method has limits when it comes to separation and detection of membrane proteins and  low abundant proteins, and improvement of this technique would be by using a non gel-based chromatography system which then is coupled directly to a mass spectrometer.  The Ultimate Nana LC is the only system known to the government that allows for automated injections of minute samples with zero sample loss, a micro column switching module that allows for automated sample preparation for multidimensional chromatography and the pro bot fraction collector.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capability.  The capability statement and any other information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow LP to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  A capability statement must be received in the contracting office no later than 2:00 PM EST on August 9, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No collects calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code 334516 and the business size standard are 500.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute(NCI), Applied Research Progream, Office of the Associate Director plans to procure the services of the Massachusetts General Hospital, Research Management, 50 Staniford Street, Suite 1001, Boston, MA 02114 for the Study of Pregnancy Hormones Across Ethnic Groups: Implications for Disparity in Breast Cancer Incidence in the Boston metropolitan area.  The NCI carries out extensive research and surveillance activities evaluating racial disparities in cancers.  For breast cancers, the disparities in incidence, tumor characteristics and mortality have been recognized for Hispancis, African Americans and Caucasinas. A new area of NCI's focus in breast cancer research is the area of early life exposures.  Studies have evaluated characteristics of the newborn and on characteristics of the pregnancy itself.  NCI's proposed study is to follow-up on the findings from Lipworth and coworkers in different ethnic groups who vary in their risk of breast cancer.  To achieve the goal of this study, investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) will share their resources of blood samples and their laboratory will perform a variety of hormone analyses on samples from Hispanic, African-Amerian and Caucasian women.  Under the direction of NCI, appropriate samples from pregnant women drawn for a study of gestational hypertension will be removed from long-term storage.  There will be two parts of the analyses; A pre-test with 45 aliquotes of blood to establish appropriate quality control within the laboratory, and the analysis of study subject's samples.  Prior to initiation of the study, the Massachusetts General Hospital will provide a Project Plan that outlines the hormones to be analyzed, the number of days required and the dates or time line for data delivery.  Massachusetts General Hospital is the only known source to the government with access to these samples, with minimal possibility of damage to samples during transport from the freezer to the laboratory, and the ability to perform 9 hormone assay on 2 milliliters of sample.  In addition, they possess appropriate staff, equipment supplies and facilities necessary to carry out this requirement.  However, if any interested party believes it too can meet the above, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information  must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statment must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 9, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of deterining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code: 541380.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plans to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to the George Washington University, Washington, DC, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). The objective of this requirement is to provide the following tasks: Contractor shall provide support of the Metrology for Systems-on-a Chip (SoC) Focus Project. The George Washington University will be participating in the research and the development as relevant to the multi-technology System-on-a Chip Project. The multi-Technology SoC will be the integration of NIST developed MEMS based Gas Sensor as Virtual Component (VC) with other circuits to realize SoC. The work will address a design methodology that addresses the problems for non-logic VCs and encapsulates them in a digital shell. This makes the non-logic functions for the system. This approach makes it the VC designer's task to design non-logic VCs that fit well into the SoC design methodologies. Finally, this design methodology is consistent with the platform design methodology that is most commonly used for SoC design and test of SoC devices. Task I) Applying a top-down approach to determine the test and metrology requirements of a MEMS bases Gas Sensor as a Virtual Component (VC) by first surveying and technical requirements for gas sensing systems; Task II) Survey existing integrated sensor technologies that are compatible with being implemented as VCs for SoCs or MCMs; and Task III) Outlining the circuit's requirement for MEMs-based Gas Sensors to be Virtual Components. This will include the study of the requirements for the Analog-to-Digital circuitry to be integrated with the MEMS based device, the other needed circuitry to support Testing and integration it as VC on the chip. Work will be performed at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. George Washington University is the only source for this service as they have personnel with the expertise and familiarity to meet the milestones of this work within the time that is allotted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plans to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to PMDTec in Siegen, Germany, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). The objective of this requirement is to provide the following: Feasibilty Study concerning the use of CMOS - and related PMD - technologies containing points as listed: Review of relevant CMOS photonic technologies for the stated requirement specifications based on PMDTec/S-TEC experience, Provide optical power calculations for certain background light illuminations, Provide algorithms for range and multi-range calculations; Provide description of additional technologies that will be necessary to meet specifications.  Include analytical or experimental data to support reasoning if available, 
and Prepare concept study report. PMDTec is the only vendor to provide this services as they have spent time building solid state Photoelectronic Mixing Device (PMD) test modules over the last few years and are now making experimental camera modules. PMDTec uses LED illumination to achieve range images at ranges out to about 7-10 meters.  The approach taken at PMDTec is similar to CSEM design in that it uses phase-based correlation and CMOS photogate-based detection combined with a non-coherent illumination source (LEDs operating in the 990 nm regime).  At PMDTec, both charge buckets are read and it is the difference between the two that is reported, with an automatic removal per pixel per range of the external noise, including solar radiation influx.  A second benefit of this approach is that, due to the Direct Fourier Transform (DFT) math, it is in fact these exact differences that enter into the equation for phase shift (and hence range measurement).  Thus, they only need to do a 0-degree and 90-degree phase shift and subsequent integration.  This increases the limiting frame rate by a factor of two.  The second important approach that has already been reduced to silicon at PMDTec is the use of a pseudo random code to drive the light source (and to provide the synchronization signal) instead of a harmonic oscillator.  This leads to faster correlation lock and a higher S/N ratio. The period of performance is date of award through October 31, 2002. The anticipated award date is on or about 5 days from the date of this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. Interested persons may identify their intent and capability to respond to the requirement no later than the response date above.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with New England Medical Center Hospitals, Inc. 
Boston, MA.
Purpose:5.6 million seniors are enrolled in Medicare Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and continued growth is expected.  Most analyses comparing health outcomes in traditional Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) vs. Medicare HMOs derive largely from studies of select HMOs, in a few geographic areas, before the 1990s enrollment surge. 
The proposed contractor has ?with AHRQ and National Institute of Agency (NIA) grant support -- compared health outcomes among seniors in Medicare FFS vs. HMOs.  The proposed contractor has also evaluated whether HMO model-type or profit-status are associated with outcome differences.
The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain the analytical services of the proposed contractor to update the above-described analysis to include a 4-year follow-up (in contradistinction to the 2-year follow-up involved in the above-described analysis).   
 THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND	NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Cochrane Child Health Field, University of 
Alberta, Alberta, Canada.
Purpose: Contractor shall conduct research and develop a report examining the methodological issues in child-relevant systematic reviews.
The mission of the Cochrane Child Health Field is to ensure that children (birth-18 years) receive health services that are effective and based on up-to-date evidence.  To achieve this mission, the field facilitates the identification, organization, dissemination and use of current and future knowledge about effective health care for children.  
In response to concerns about methodological issues in evidence reviews that may be related to children, the Cochrane Child Health Field International Advisory Group is concerned about the attitude taken by some (both within and outside of the Cochrane hierarchy) that there is no need to perform separate child health reviews and that there also is a bias against analysis of children as a subgroup.  This may rest on an assumption that there is not much difference between children and adults and that mixed or adult studies can be safely generalized to children.  AHRQ's Evidence-based Practice Centers, including those that conduct evidence syntheses for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have raised the same issues about including children in their evidence reports and conducting separate analyses for children.  This clearly is not the case for neonates, but we also think it is not likely to be the case for children.  The Child Health Field will look at this assumption from several viewpoints:  1) an examination of the empirical evidence that effect sizes are different for children by looking at subgroup analyses and separate reviews; 2) an examination of the implications of subgroup analyses when these are not a priori questions. AHRQ's Evidence-based Practice Centers program and its U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Program, will benefit immensely from these analyses.
THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>R ? PROFESSIONAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, AND MANAGEMENT SUPPORT SERVICES ? U.S. Dept. of Commerce/BEA, The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has developed several satellite accounts designed to expand the analytical capabilities of the system of national accounts.  One such account is the Travel and Tourism Satellite Accounts (TTSAS) developed in 1997-1998 and benchmarked to 1992.  The TTSAs are used to determine the economic size of U.S. travel and tourism.  BEA is updating the TTSA's and is seeking to improve the accuracy of each TTSA component.  

BEA's primary goal is to secure the best, most comprehensive data as appropriate input's for their TTSA's.  To improve the estimates of the TTSAs, BEA needs:

1) Better measures of travel and tourism expenditures in total and by type of traveler for both domestic and overseas travel.  Data are needed from 1997 to 2001. 
2) Data on the amount of automobile usage to include within the TTSA.  This includes not only the gasoline and related ?out-of pocket' expenditures centered around the automobile, but also inclusion of a portion of the purchase price of an automobile within the TTSA as a durable good purchase and other related expenses.
3) Data on the rents and imputed rents from vacation (2nd) homes.  Imputed rents are relatively standard within the system of national accounts framework, but difficult to apply within the TTSA framework due to lack of government data.

4) BEA needs the data for 1997 to 2000 by September 2002, and for 2001 by October 2002.

5) High quality data collected directly from travelers on their expenditures.  The collection of these data should be based on sound statistical sampling techniques and methodology.  There are no public sources of data on these expenditures.

Data to be provided: The vendor will provide the BEA with several data series for 2001, 2000 and 1997 (total and by quarter) for utilization in updating their TTSA.  Interested parties shall submit on e-mail to Jean.Hairston@NOAA.GOV  and the subject of the mail should state: RFQ Data on Travel and Tourism.
 Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all  proposals received within fifteen days (15) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Award will be made using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires a quantity of two Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (ADR) units.  The units will be used to test superconducting devices at 100 mK.  The ADR units must be an exact replica of the four existing ADR units already being used for testing in the laboratory.  NIST has made a substantial investment over the years in the development of custom cryostats, sensor mounts, flexible wiring, repair tools, EMI shielding and custom electronics that are used with these ADR units.  This ADR technology was originally developed at NIST and licensed to Janis Research Company, Wilmington, MA.  Therefore, NIST proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1),  with Janis Research for the new ADR units.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Any information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest.  This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  The anticipated award date is August 27, 2002.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service, Northeast Fisheries Science Center is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with E. G. Solutions, Inc. to provide three (3) Rotary Screw Fish Traps to increase capacity of smolt capture arrays used very successfully in previous work on endangered Atlantic salmon smolts since 1996.   Sampling gear that causes minimal mortality is required to collect Atlantic salmon smolts in the Narraguagus River that are part of a population that has been listed as a species of concern under the Endangered Species Act.  Successive trials have indicated a negligible salmon mortality of <.75% as compared to other systems.  The passive capture design; the flow through, self cleaning live-well; modular design; and the ability to locate these units in remote sections of free flowing rivers are technical features that are unique to this trap which are not available from any other source.  These features make this trap both efficient and very gentle on the fish collected.   With the expanded study design in 1999, it is imperative that standardized effort is attained between all traps utilized.  The Rotary Screw Fish Trap is a patented item and E. G. Solutions is the sole licensed manufacturer of this trap.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of  their capability to respond to the requirement by August 9, 2002.  Written requests may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.   The solicitation document will be issued on or about August 9, 2002.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

B-Evaluation Consultancy Opportunity to Perform Research on TDA Project Activities

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) wishes to announce a competitive small business set-aside for a consultancy opportunity for an individual to assist the TDA Evaluation Officer in collecting and analyzing project information for a number of TDA evaluation activities. This will be a firm fixed priced labor rate contract not to exceed $43,000, based on a hourly rate not to exceed $21 per hour for up to 12 month's work, on-site in TDA Offices.  Based on work accomplished at the end that period, TDA reserves the option to extend the contract beyond the 12-month period. This contract will be awarded subject to availability of funds or may be incrementally funded.

This project is designed to comprehensively acquire necessary information on recently completed TDA projects; to make that information available to TDA staff and to the general public in a useful manner; and to utilize some of the information to complete certain specific evaluations projects.  

The crucial aspects of the work are: (1) the evaluations consultant will obtain information from TDA files (supplemented as necessary by discussion with the regional teams and by calls to private companies) on all new TDA obligations.  This information will be placed in the appropriate place in the evaluations data file in the electronic database; new records will be created for brand new projects; old records will be revised when there has been a new obligation on an old project.  (2) the evaluations consultant will help the TDA Evaluations Officer determine which TDA projects have been completed (i.e. projects for which all TDA-funded activities were carried out).    The relevant portions of the data file will be updated.  

In addition, the evaluations consultant will be required to analyze the newly acquired information and write short memos on: (1) How many small companies win TDA feasibility study contracts; (2) What proportion of TDA feasibility study contractors are selected competitively; and (3) What proportion of TDA projects are cost shared (i.e. when entities other than TDA share the costs of doing the study)?   

TDA, located in Arlington, VA, is an export promotion U.S. Government foreign assistance agency that helps U.S. companies pursue overseas business opportunities.  Through the funding of feasibility studies, orientation visits, training grants, and various forms of technical assistance, TDA enables American businesses to become involved in the planning stage of infrastructure and industrial projects in middle-income and developing countries.

The Small Business Act, at 15 U.S.C. 644, authorizes procuring agencies to set aside procurements or portions of procurements for the exclusive participation of Small Business Concerns.  
Definition: ?Small business concerns? for purposes of TDA award of this total set aside contract means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant the field of operation for which it is bidding.  In determining whether dominance exists for TDA?s purpose for this contract, consideration is give to annual gross receipts.  Any concern that has annual gross receipts above $5 million, averaged over a three year period, is not considered small and is therefore, NOT eligible for award under this contract.

All participating organizations involved with supplying professional services must be incorporated or chartered in the United States.  Individuals, sole proprietors, or consultants planning teaming arrangements must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens.  In accordance with FAR 19.301, offerors will be required to submit self certification relating to business size.  The competitive proposals method of solicitation as set forth in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1) shall be utilized for this procurement.  This solicitation in no way obligates TDA to award a contract, nor does it commit TDA to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal.  Any explanation desired by an offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of this solicitation must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for reply to reach the offerors before submission of their offerors.  All oral explanations or instruction, given before award of this contract will not be binding.  Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning the solicitation will be furnished promptly to all prospective offerors as an amendment of the solicitation, if such information is necessary to offerors submitting proposals or if lack of such information would be prejudicial to uninformed offerors.

The individual selected for this work should be a college graduate or possess comparable educational or professional experience, demonstrate computer proficiency and be available for work in approximately 30-40 days from the date of this announcement at an hourly rate of $21 or less. Anyone interested in being considered for this work must submit a resume that describes their educational and professional background; describes their computer proficiency, provide assurances that they will be available in all major time periods (fall/winter and spring/summer), including approximate date they could start work, if selected; submit a short (no more than 4 pages double spaced) paper that demonstrates their writing capability; indicates their capability for this kind of research and tells why they are interested in this kind work.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>USAID/PHilippines intends to award a sole-source contract for approximately 34 months beginning on or about July 1, 2002 at an estimated $7.0 million to Louis Berger International Inc. (LBII). The contract will enable LBII to expand its provision of much needed assistance to former Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) combatants, originally numbering 3,500, but now increased by 8,000 for a total of 11,500 combatants.  The assistance will help them make a transition from being guerilla warriors to productive farmers.  A successful transition will make the Peace Agreement between the Government of the Philippines and the MNLF a reality.  

The contract is being sole-sourced under AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) for the continued provision of specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additonal costs to the Government or would result in additional delays.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(d)(xv), all responsible sources may submit to the Supervisory Contract Officer, a bid, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.  The Supervisory Contract Officer or, in his absence, the Acquisition Specialist, can be reached at tel no. (632) 552-9923, (632) 552-9924, or (632) 552-9900.

<DESC>The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) intends to award a competitive cooperative agreement to provide technical support to the national RTAP.  The cooperative agreement will be for a five year period and the anticipated level of funding available on an annual basis will be approximately $750,000.  The recipient of the cooperative agreement will assume primary responsibility for administration and management of the national RTAP and will develop and disseminate training materials designed for use by rural transit providers; establish a liaison relationship with the state RTAP managers to ensure that the products developed and activities undertaken through the national RTAP are of use to and supportive of the state programs, promote information exchange at all levels, and encourage coordination of state efforts; maintain, a national clearinghouse for rural transit technology-sharing and information dissemination, a central collection of products and services that are useful to rural transit professionals; promote and monitor use of the RTAP national resource center; develop and implement a national self-help technical assistance network that facilitate the exchange of technologies and techniques among rural transit operators on a peer-to-peer basis;  provide a research and technical support capacity to FTA to address issues of immediate concern to the rural transit programs; maintain a mechanism for user input and feedback such as the program review board, which functions as the mechanism for providing the national program with guidance on priority needs in the areas of training materials development, information dissemination, and technical assistance.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria; the overall technical approach to the requirements of the statement of work, particularly the proposer's understanding of the objectives of the national RTAP and how these objectives will be met by their proposal; the qualifications and work experience of proposed personnel; and the capability for managing an active and varied rural technical assistance program.  Experience in working with rural transportation professionals from local, state and federal government as well as public and private transportation operators and volunteer organizations is an important requirement. If proposals indicate that some tasks may be performed by other organizations or subcontractor (s), the proposal should also demonstrate ability to oversee their performance.  All reasonable private non-profit sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  Please contact Lorna Wilson at (202) 366-0893 to request a copy of the statement of work.   Proposals are due by August 23, 2002.

The services to be provided are Landbird Monitoring professional technical services to collect information; conduct surveys; conduct analyses; and conduct focused investigations to evaluate the consequences of selected Forest Service Management activities. The purpose of these activities contributes to aiding the Forest Service meet its bird conservation responsibilities under the Multiple-Use Sustained Yield Act, National Forest Management Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act and Executive Order 13186. 

The Northern Region of the USDA Forest Service has been conducting landbird monitoring surveys across the Region for the past ten years.  Information collected from these surveys has been used to develop species/habitat relationships, to provide baseline information for long-term trend assessments and to conduct focused investigations to evaluate the consequences of selected Forest Service management activities

To date, this program has been implemented jointly between the USDA Forest Service and the University of Montana.  Although both the Forest Service and the University of Montana work closely in all phases of the monitoring program, the Forest Service establishes priorities and collects data, while the University focuses on data analysis and reporting on conclusions and findings.  The University of Montana has done this work under 2 contracts with the Northern Region.

Summary Statement of Work: The primary responsibilities under the current contracts include conducting long term landbird trend monitoring using approximately 300 (ten point) transects on up to 13 National Forests and/or Grasslands across northern Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and northwestern South Dakota.  These permanently marked transects are distributed fairly uniformly across the Region and are surveyed every other year.  In intervening years, new transects are established in a manner suitable to monitor the effects of conditions or management activities on birds that are of particular interest to land managers.  In either case, the contractor is responsible for helping screen for qualified field personnel, conducting training in data collection and recording, ensuring quality control for data collection, analyzing and storing the information, drawing conclusions and reporting on findings.

Methods for data collection follow established protocols established for conducting standardized bird point counts ... see Hamel, P. et al 1995 A Land managers Guide to Point Counts of Birds in the Southeast; and Ralph, C.J. et al 1996 Handbook of Field Methods For Monitoring Landbirds.  Data analysis requires the use of appropriate statistical techniques.  Where appropriate, reports are to be written in a format suitable for publication in scientific journals.  Publication of results in professional journals or technical reports may be required.  Contractor responsibilities include providing standardized reports, responding to occasional specific requests from field personnel and posting and maintaining data and analysis results on the website.

For the short-term focused surveys, the contractor responsibilities, with assessment of results by the Forest Service, include recommending all aspects of the monitoring protocol.  Contractor responsibilities also include training of data gathering personnel, quality control, data analysis, and reporting.  The tasks identified above, includes survey design, sampling strategy and sampling intensity.  In recommending all aspects of the monitoring protocols, the contractor will have to work closely with Forests/grasslands regarding the need for specific support data and logistics for supporting data collection.

<SUBJECT>B -- Special Studies
<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Public Technology, Inc. (PTI).   This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the U.S. Geological Survey, Geographic Information Office.  This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The Government has a requirement for development of geospatial national standards in support of the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) in their work on the electronic government initiative Geospatial One-Stop.  Task one of the Geospatial One-Stop includes the development of national standards that are relevant to the nation.  The FGDC must fully engage all sectors of the Geospatial community under this task.  Local government is a key sector that needs to be fully engaged in the Geospatial One-Stop in general and the standards development activities in particular.  It is estimated that two thirds of the geospatial data collection in the United States is done at the local level.  The need is for local government to use national standards, therefore it is critical that leading county and city organizations be engaged as full participants in the standards task and this electronic government initiative.  Public Technology Inc., is the non-profit technology organization for all cities and counties in the United States. The National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, and the International City/County Management Association, three primary local government associations, provide PTI with its policy direction. Created in 1971, PTI is the only national organization dedicated to furthering the use of technology in both cities and counties, for both elected officials and professional managers. Through collective research and development efforts in its member jurisdictions, PTI creates and advances technology-based products, services, and enterprises for all cities and counties and has been an active leader in e-government.  The PTI Leadership is comprised of diverse local leaders from across the country. Most importantly PTI has obtained the endorsement of three key local government organizations to serve as local government coordinator for Geospatial One-Stop Project. The National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, and the International City/County Management Association have agreed to support the efforts of PTI in coordinating the overall involvement of these organizations in this e-government initiative. The period of performance for this effort is for 12 months from date of award.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by August 12, 2002. This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>B--WHITE PAPERS SOUGHT FOR PROPOSED RESEARCH TO SUPPORT THE TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT AND RESEARCH PROGRAM
<DESC>This announcement solicits White Papers, of not more than   five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to   the Minerals Mangement Service (MMS) Technology Assessment   and Research (TA&R) Program, Operational Safety and Engineering   Research (OSER). The MMS web site has descriptions of OSER   activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects.   The web site address is http://www.mms.gov/tarp/safety.htm.   We encourage interested parties to view the information presented   on the site when considering submitting White Papers. BACKGROUND:   Research sponsored by MMS through the TA&R Program is used   to acquire basic engineering information needed to oversee   the orderly development of offshore oil and gas operations.   New challenges and informational needs arise as companies use   new equipment or procedures based on technological changes   or as operations expand into new or different environments   such as the deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The   principal objective of this request for White Papers is to   address innovative or technological advancements among several   general topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the   White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this   announcement, selected proposals shall be requested. Projects   selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding   from FY 2003 funds. The MMS anticipates a total of $800,000 to $1,000,000 may be available for the initiation of new research   proposals addressing OSER topics in FY 2003 with projects being   identified through this announcement and additional avenues.   Typical projects envisioned to address the topics set forth   below may require one quarter to one man-year effort and prospective   offerors shall bear this in mind when responding to this request.   OBJECTIVES: The proposed objectives for the FY 2003 OSER activities   include research related to the following: 1)Evaluation of subsea BOP system performance in ultra-deep water using BOP test data (with emphasis on rigs placed in service in the last 5 years). 2)Evaluation of surface BOP systems performance using BOP test data. 3)Performance assessment of blind-shear or shear rams used in subsea and surface BOP stacks. The assessment should examine the shearing capability for various grades of  drill pipe and other tubulars under varying conditions; comparison of shear rams and blind-shear rams; and configuration options for placing the blind-shear rams in the stack. 4)Evaluation of safety concerns during well testing from OCS drilling rigs. The evaluation should address safety devices; inspection and testing of well test equipment; disposition of test production; differences between testing on dynamic positioned vessels and moored vessels; and well testing under Arctic conditions. 5)Evaluation of rig requirements for drilling deep high pressure - high temperature wells (15K+ feet) on the OCS. The evaluation should consider safety concerns when pushing depth limits on older drilling rigs, adequacy of BOP and mud-handling systems, and the potential for H2S. 6)Prevention and remediation of sustained casing pressure, including new cementing types and techniques; tubing design and installation; and intervention methods. 7)Effects of high temperature / high pressure production streams on platform production piping and vessels ( with emphasis on new HTHP production being introduced to existing platforms.) 8)A review and comparison of research on human limitations in responding to automated data inputs from control room management and monitoring systems in offshore drilling and production and other industries (Nuclear, Airlines, etc.) 9)Development of integrity methodologies for topsides of offshore production facilities that considers the integrity of the risers and operating plant to include wear and the lack of maintenance; and/or the integrity of the topside structural system to include means for evaluating corrosion protection (with emphasis on level 1 surveys and data collection). 10)Reliability of surface safety systems, including valves, in Arctic weather conditions.  11)Evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of offshore pipeline potential readings where pipelines originate or terminate at structures. 12)Identify effectiveness of current procedures utilized to prevent vortex induced vibration in subsea pipelines in the Cook Inlet, Alaska, or areas of similar operational environments and evaluate alternative state-of-the-art technologies which may be employed to produce superior performance.  13)Assessment of safety risks associated with complete or partial removal of subsea pipeline verses leaving in place. The study should consider different options for removal from shallow water and deepwater relative to the feasibility of the methods, safety aspects, and relevant costs. 14)Assess the current state-of-the-practice for the construction and maintenance of ice islands. Evaluate ice island technology to identify areas where further research and development would decrease the effort required to construct and maintain ice islands.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:   The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to safety   and pollution practices related to Offshore operations. As   a result of the White Papers, selected proposals will be sought   and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should   be to the above stated issues and/or other related issues to   the Offshore operations. Multi-year funding of project is acceptable.   HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages   in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS five (5) copies and one (1) electronic   copy in pdf format, on a CD, or on a standard 3 inch diskette,   shall be submitted to the U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,   MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE, 381 ELDEN STREET, HERNDON VA 20170-4817,   not later than September 16, 2002, 04:00 PM, EDT. WHITE PAPERS   SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES SHALL NOT ACCEPTED. White Papers   should define the proposed research scope and include the   level of effort.

<SUBJECT>A -- SMART WEAPONS INTERACTIVE WORKSHOP
<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Joint Munitions Test and Evaluation Program Office (commonly known as CHICKEN LITTLE), Eglin AFB FL, is hosting the Third Annual Smart Weapons Interactive Workshop on 27-29 August 2002.  This workshop provides an opportunity to share information, issues, and concerns dealing with development and testing of smart weapons systems.
This synopsis is an invitation to Government and industry for participation in the Smart Weapons Interactive Workshop.  The first day of the conference is devoted to a tour of the Eglin ranges and facilities.  Anticipated stops include the Climatic Laboratory, Guided Weapons Facility, Foreign Target Compound, Signature Test and Evaluation Facility, and related smart weapons development facilities.  The second and third days will provide a classified forum to exchange and discuss problems and concerns with the development and testing of state of the art smart weapons systems.  Presentations are solicited from groups and individuals working in the smart weapons development areas from target recognition to battle damage indicators and all areas in between.  We also request that all potential participants identify areas within the test and evaluation community that are cause for concern, either because of lack of facilities, difficulty in satisfying requirements, cost, understanding of the latest DoD, Air Force, Army, or Navy test directives, or related issues of general interest.  Goals of the conference are to promote open communication that leads to eventual solutions.
	This workshop will occur 27 ? 29 August 2002 at the Eglin Conference Center, Eglin AFB, FL.  The POC at Eglin AFB is Fred Reichstetter (Northrop Grumman Information Technology) commercial 850-882-7638 or e-mail: reichste@eglin.af.mil.  Persons wishing to attend and/or present briefings please call POC for brochure, registration form, and additional details.  Registration fee of $75 applies to cover conference rooms, tours, and other expenses.  All attendees are requested to send security clearances to Ms. Desi Pultz (Northrop Grumman Information Technology) commercial 850-882-8413, Fax: 850-882-9764.   Contractors will need a Government sponsor and a signed ?Need to Know? statement.  Due to the classified information exchange, foreign participation cannot be accepted.
Since this is not a request for a formal contract award, there will be no Request for Proposal (RFP), nor will any binding selection criteria be prepared.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

Statement of Work
C-130E Aircrew Training Device
02 August 2002

1.0 SCOPE
The 314 AW proposes utilizing a desktop part-task, PC-based, networked aircrew training device (ATD) to replicate the C-130E pilot, co-pilot, and navigator flight stations.  This configuration will focus on crew coordination, crew resource management (CRM), situational awareness, night vision goggle (NVG) flying, visual airdrop, visual low-level map reading, time-over-target (TOT) control, threat recognition/avoidance/ maneuvers, Station Keeping Equipment (SKE) procedures, visual formation flight, navigations systems management, NVG operations, Airborne radar approaches (ARA), and tactical formation maneuvers.   This initiative should significantly enhance aircrew readiness by providing a training bridge between classroom/simulator and the aircraft.   The device will also serve as a remedial training device for students experiencing difficulties in certain areas in the aircraft (current course loads all but prohibit remedial training in Weapons System Trainers (WST)).  Furthermore, this solution allows instructors to easily manipulate the training environment in support of diverse training scenarios, thus promoting part-task training, individualized instruction, and team training (e.g., CRM).  The ability for students to familiarize and rehearse selective skill sets, before employing the aircraft, will advance fundamental cognitive skills required to employ the C-130 weapon system.  Additionally, the flight environment simulated by using the virtual reality (VR) goggles very closely replicates the actual limitations of flying with NVGs and will likely provide exceptional training for crew members in developing NVG scanning habit patterns.  

2.0 BACKGROUND
2.1 The 314AW is the only active duty unit within the Department of Defense that provides C-130 aircrew training.  The training is provided to aircrew members from the active duty Air Force, National Guard, Reserve, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and several foreign countries.  Unfortunately, students often find the transition from classroom tactical lessons to performance in the actual aircraft a rather broad leap.  The propose desktop simulator presents a means to round out the aircrew training system by providing a hands-on cognitive learning tool which, potentially, leads to improved material retention.

2.2 Historically, aircrew training depended heavily on the weapon systems as the only realistic media for providing mission training.  ATDs were primarily used as an adjunct to prepare crewmembers to more effectively use limited flying hours.  However, increased training requirements coupled with the requirement that aircrew members graduate from the Formal Training Unit (FTU) be mission ready have reduced the quality and quantity of realistic, available training opportunities for aircrews.  The formal school training strategy employs ATDs to accomplish as many training events as practical through simulation.  For events with simulation training capability, simulation precedes on-aircraft training.  Normally, these tasks are taught to the appropriate proficiency level in the least sophisticated ATD.  Training progresses through knowledge, comprehension and performance levels.  As the student advances through the syllabus, related tasks are combined and the student is trained on the next level ATD.  With this methodology, students master procedural tasks before arrival at the aircraft.  Once at the aircraft, students concentrate on developing flying skills.  

2.3 The proposed system is not designed to reduce programmed weapon system trainer or flying hours.  Additional simulator time is not possible due to current student load, and the training requirements levied by 4 training (3 AETC, 1 CADS) and 2 operational C-130 squadrons.  It is intended to enhance the current training construct by reinforcing cognitive skills and providing a realistic simulation for tactical airlift missions.  Savings may be realized in the area of reduced ?break-in-training and additional training flights required by students who may need more time to reach required proficiency levels.  Additionally, TDY costs could be reduced by providing students training during weather and maintenance delay periods, time otherwise lost.  PC-based cognitive training simulation will improve training mission effectiveness by enhancing aircrew situational awareness, formation procedures, NVG procedures, threat recognition/reaction, and coordinated crew response.  Employing the proposed training device will unquestionably lead to improved training efficiency and optimum use of limited resources.

The recipient of the cooperative agreement will assume primary responsibility for administration and management of the national RTAP and will develop and disseminate training materials designed for use by rural transit providers; establish a liaison relationship with the state RTAP managers to ensure that the products developed and activities undertaken through the national RTAP are of use to and supportive of the state programs, promote information exchange at all levels, and encourage coordination of state efforts; maintain, a national clearinghouse for rural transit technology-sharing and information dissemination, a central collection of products and services that are useful to rural transit professionals; promote and monitor use of the RTAP national resource center; develop and implement a national self-help technical assistance network that facilitate the exchange of technologies and techniques among rural transit operators on a peer-to-peer basis;  provide a research and technical support capacity to FTA to address issues of immediate concern to the rural transit programs; maintain a mechanism for user input and feedback such as the program review board, which functions as the mechanism for providing the national program with guidance on priority needs in the areas of training materials development, information dissemination, and technical assistance.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria; the overall technical approach to the requirements of the statement of work, particularly the proposer?s understanding of the objectives of the national RTAP and how these objectives will be met by their proposal; the qualifications and work experience of proposed personnel; and the capability for managing an active and varied rural technical assistance program.  Experience in working with rural transportation professionals from local, state and federal government as well as public and private transportation operators and volunteer organizations is an important requirement. If proposals indicate that some tasks may be performed by other organizations or subcontractor (s), the proposal should also demonstrate ability to oversee their performance.  All reasonable private non-profit sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  Please contact Lorna Wilson at (202) 366-0893 to request a copy of the statement of work.   Proposals are due by August 23, 2002.
