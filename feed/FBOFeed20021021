1.1	BACKGROUND

Bechtel Nevada, Livermore Operations (LO) is looking for a supplier multi-wavelength (one usable wavelength at a time), Long Pulse Laser (LPL) system. This system will be used in the calibration and characterization of optical detectors, streak cameras and x-ray streak cameras (stimulation being in the UV range) in support of NIF/HEDP programs at LLNL and other National test sites. The type of laser will be an Nd:YAG. 

1.2	PROGRAM NEEDS

The purpose and objective of the laser system is to provide a system that can be used to characterize and calibrate a variety of electro-optic detectors over many wavelengths and power levels, from visible to UV to x-ray. This system is essential to the needs of the Long Pulse Lab at LO when addressing the support needed for the NIF/Stockpile Stewardship programs. NIF has a schedule for generating first light (referred to as NEL) and will utilize optical detectors that are to be calibrated at the LO facility. The Long Pulse Laser is scheduled to be installed and working at the LO facility by February 2003. Once this system is installed, the requirement to be in an operational condition means that should a failure occur, the system must be repaired and returned to full operational status with a down time of no more than 48 hours max per episode.

1.3	REQUIREMENT

Provide, deliver and install a Nd-YAG laser in accordance with specification LO-A150-02-03 and the subcontract documents.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) for a SeaWiFS Case-2 In-Water Optical Profiler Concept Development Study.  It is the intent of NASA to study the Case-2 Coastal environment.  New instrumentation and methods will be developed to study this environment.  An instrument will be developed, as an in-water profiler having all the capabilities needed for collecting the highest quality data possible in the coastal ocean.	The instrument is required to achieve a radiometric accuracy to within 5% absolute and 1% relative, water-leaving radiances to within 5% absolute, and chlorophyll a concentration to within 35% over a range of 0.05-50.0mg m-3.   This acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside.  The Government plans to conduct a phased acquisition involving a competitive down-selection process.  The acquisition will be conducted in two phases.  Phase A will be a request for a "Concept" proposal; this will result in the awarding of one to three Simplified Acquisition Purchase Orders for "Feasibility Studies".  Phase B will be the production of the radiometric instrument to meet NASA's needs, a Case-2 In-Water Optical Profiler.  NASA will select one "best approach" study to produce this prototype; a partnership will be offered under the Space Act Agreement.  Competition for the Phase B will build on the results of the Phase A.  The award criteria for the Phase B will include completion of specified requirements in the Phase A Feasibility Study.	The Government expects that only the initial phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for Phase B.	Proposals for Phase B will be requested from these contractors.  The Government intends to issue a new, formal solicitation for Phase B.  Phase B of this acquisition will be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.201 and 5.203.  Notwithstanding the expectation that only the initial phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the Phase B, proposals from all responsible sources submitted by the specified due date will be considered.  In order to contend for the Phase B award, however, such prospective offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to those of the Phase A contractors.  Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for an agreement.  The Phase B agreement will be a cost-sharing arrangement.  Upon the successful completion of this agreement, NASA will waive their data rights to enable the Contractor to manufacture the instrument as a viable commercial product.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See note 26. This procurement is a total small business set-aside.  See Note 1. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 500, respectively. The DPAS Rating for this procurement is DO C9. The anticipated release date of RFQ 903-84499-GCX is on or about 11/15/02 with an anticipated quote due date of on or about 01/02/03. All qualified  responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. An ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.	The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GSFC Business Opportunities home page is  http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51   Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.	It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential quoters will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for the modernization of the existing Warren E. Burger Federal Building and US Courthouse in St.Paul, MN in accordance with (GSA) quality standards and requirements. The seven-story building was constructed in 1966 and provides approximately 399,938 gross square feet.  Major work items include tenant alterations, ADA upgrades, asbestos abatement, security enhancements, Art-in-Architecture, HVAC, mechanical and electrical upgrades. Construction will be phased and the building will be occupied during construction.  All building systems must remain in operation during construction and the project phased to avoid disruption to the occupants.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is $25 million to $35 million. Construction will utilize the CMc (Construction Manager as Constructor) approach.  The scope of work will require at a minimum: programming, space planning, design services, construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS).  The objective of the selection process is to select a renovation designer and a firm that exemplifies design excellence. This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Design Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E Design firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept and the building?s architecture.  The A/E Firm must clearly define the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and its ability to manage the design and production of construction.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants related to meeting the requirements of this RFQ.  The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, an interested firm will submit a portfolio of accomplishments to establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8 1/2? x 11? format.  The Stage I submission should include the following: A) a cover letter referencing the announcement and briefly describing the firm, its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; B) Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project) modified to include only the A/E?s information (Identification of consultants is not required at this stage) and C) a design portfolio which is to include the following submission requirements and evaluation criteria: (1) Lead Designer Portfolio (35% of evaluated score): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer?s ability to provide design excellence.  Submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a typewritten description (maximum of two pages per project) of up to three renovation projects of comparable size completed in the last ten years.  Emphasis should be placed on projects utilizing a CMc approach in an occupied building with minimal interruptions to tenant operations.  The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the design was cost effective (both in terms of construction and maintenance), functional, and aesthetically appropriate. Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria #2, the Lead Designer will address his/her participation in the project. (2) Past Performance on Design (25%): The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five renovation projects of comparable size completed in the last ten years.  Emphasis should be placed on projects utilizing a CMc approach in an occupied building with minimal interruptions to tenant operations.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client?s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers. (3) Philosophy and Design Intent (25%): In the Lead Designer?s words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state his/her overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters inherent in this project. (4) Lead Designer Profile (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer, a representative of the client and professional representatives from GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The Board will establish a short-list of three to six firms.  For Stage II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. The firms will be required to complete Standard Forms 254 and 255 that reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  The Selection Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out the project, project management experience in occupied buildings and overall project management.  The Stage II evaluations will culminate with an interview with the A/E Evaluation Board. Award of this contract is contingent upon the receipt of design funds and negotiation of a reasonable fee.  This is not a request for a fee proposal.  A/E firms will not be reimbursed for expenses or efforts under Stage I and/or Stage II submissions.

<DESC>The requirement is to procure Aircraft Integrated Maintenance Rotor Track and Balance systems (?AIMS systems?), and related supplies and services for the CH-46E Helicopter.  It includes aircraft kits, ancillary hardware, and engineering and technical services necessary to upgrade CH-46E aircraft.  The main components of the aircraft kit include: AIMS Processor Unit, Acquisition Control Unit, Memory Card, Sensors, Aircraft Installation components and Ground Software.  This product is an adaptation of the existing VXP Balancer/Analyzer previously procured from Chadwick-Helmuth for the CH-46E.   The AIMS monitoring system when installed in the CH-46E aircraft will provide continuous monitoring of rotor track and balance data, vibration levels of all rotating pumps and drive shafts and will provide aircraft crew and maintainers immediate feedback of the aircraft operating condition and engine performance. The Government intends to procure these items on a sole source basis with Chadwick-Helmuth Company, El Monte, California, which is the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System and the only known company with the knowledge, experience, and technical data required to fulfill this need.  Chadwick-Helmuth was selected and qualified by the Original Equipment Maintenance (OEM), Boeing Helicopter, as the source for the 8500C Balancer/Analyzer is currently being used for the CH-46.  The AIMS rotor tracker and balance system function will be performed using the same proven algorithms as developed for the 8500C system.  The duration of the BOA will be through October 2005.  note 22.

<DESC>This five-year effort will consist of multiple, rapid response delivery orders for Research and Development, external anlalyses, and assessments of technical programs.  For purposes of the solicitation, "rapid response" is defined as the offeror's ability to quickly respond to and submit delivery order request for proposals for future delivery orders.  The Government considers rapid response as 15 calendar days or less under normal circumstances.  These efforts will be directed at supporting key technologies within the technical areas:  Aircraft Gas Turbine Engines, Aerospace Power, and Advanced Propulsion.  
	Key Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine technologies include, but are not limited to:  fans, compressors, combustors, turbines, nozzles, mechanical systems, controls, fuels, lubricants, and technologies related to advanced cycles, as well as overall engine and cycle performance, inlet/nozzle integration, thermal management systems, observability,  versatile cores, durability, intelligent engines, and all aspects of cost reduction.  Additionally, advanced instrumentation, engine health management, improved materials, and technologies related to noise/emissions are critical to supporting the warfighter. 
 Key Aerospace Power technologies include, but are not limited to:  aircraft electrical technology, electrical machines, thermionic energy conversion, pulse power, high power, fluid/mechanical technology, electrochemical energy conversion and storage, thermal technology, advanced plasma research, power electronics technology, space based power systems, magneto hydro dynamic (MHD) power generation, and superconducting power generation technology.  
Key Advanced Propulsion Technologies include, but are not limited to:  ramjet, scramjet, and combined cycle propulsion concepts and their component technologies (inlets, combustors, nozzles, structures, propellants, control systems); new, innovative propulsion concepts and their component technologies; and integration of aerospace propulsion cycles with air vehicles, weapons, and launch vehicles.  
This contractual action also includes administrative support incidental to and in support of R&D requirements for the directorate.  This administrative support will fall under the heading of Advisory & Assistance Services (A&AS) and will utilize approximately 20% of the dollars for this program.  There are three primary areas where this A&AS will be required.  The first area is planning assistance and support services.  There are multiple AF and PR level programming events each year.  A&AS support for these events includes data consolidation and agenda preparation for reviews and independent analyses of research plans.  The second area is information dissemination.  This includes multiple forms of technical reporting and marketing.  The third area is R&D programmatic maintenance.  This includes data compilation (planned budgets, schedules, execution), data analysis and reporting, and directorate wide development and training for applicable database systems.  Additionally, some administrative support may be required to support individual research and development delivery orders.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a  competitive Request for Proposal(RFP)for AERONET compatible Sun-Sky Scanning Spectral Radiometers.  NASA owns and operates 80 Cimel Sun-Sky Scanning Spectral Radiometers as part of the EOS Aerosol Validation Program called AERONET.  The program is a larger Federated Global Network of approximately 200 identical instruments designed to measure aerosol properties from land and ocean sites.  In order to insure compatibility within the network, any additional instruments must be identical in optical characteristics, measurement protocol, data acquisition and field hardness.  The current CIMEL 318 Radiometer functions reliably in the harsh environmental conditions (humidity, rain, insects and human abuse) expected in our remote sites.  The instrument is required to transmit data through the data collection system of the GOES, METEOSTAT and GMS Satellites and operates on battery and solar panels.  The measurement protocol requires direct sun and diffuse sky measurments to be automatically taken according to re-programmed solar zenith angles and scattering angles optimized for analysis of data to estimated aerosol properties.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Clinical Pharmacology Scientific Core (CPSC), intends to procure services for an Analytical Chemist in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  This announcement constitutes the only combined
synopsis/solicitation, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 01-09 August 2002.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $6M.  The Clinical Pharmacology Scientific Core (CPSC), Medical Oncology Clinical Research Unit, Center for Cancer Research, NCI has as its primary research interest the use of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic methods to develop new anticancer and antiretroviral agents.  The CPSC, is utilizing compartmental and non-compartmental methods to define the therapeutic range for these agents.  Moreover, several of CPSC clinical trials have utilized adaptive control with feedback mechanisms.  Likewise, the CPSC collaborates with numerous intramural and extramural groups by providing pharmacokinetic and analytical support.  Because utilizing these techniques to optimize the development of new anticancer agents requires a team of individuals with specialized skills (i.e., pharmacokinetic modeling techniques, analytical techniques, pharmacodynamic techniques, etc.) success is dependent on a coordinated effort between the disciplines.  The CPSC requires the skills of an analytical chemist to participate in the analysis of CAI and UCN01.  Such a specialist is needed to characterize the pharmacokinetics in preclinical models.  This expertise is not currently available elsewhere in the Clinical Center or the Institute.  All work is to be performed at the contractor's facility.  The contractor shall receive the samples from the NCI via federal express on dry ice.  The contractor shall then provide the NCI e-mailed results, as well as hard copies within forty-eight hours of receiving the samples.

 POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. South Africa: Hot-Briquetted Iron Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the development of a Hot-Briquetted Iron (HBI) plant in South Africa. 

Mintek, the Grantee, is a publicly owned South African technology firm. Mintek proposes the development of a new two million ton per annum HBI facility to manufacture HBI exclusively for export to supply worldwide mini-mill steel makers.  The project site remains to be determined and will be considered as part of the study.  Mintek is considering Saldanha Bay, 75 km north of Cape Town, or Sishen, 300 km southwest of Johannesburg.  

South Africa is uniquely positioned to competitively supply HBI, a key input for high-end steel production, to worldwide markets, given its natural resources and recent developments with natural gas projects.  The supply of low cost, reliable HBI will enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. steel makers seeking to reduce their production costs.  

The feasibility study herewith commissioned would include: 1) Market Survey for HBI; 2) Technical Analysis; 3) Economic Analysis; 4) Financial Analysis; 5) Environmental Impact Analysis; 6) Regulatory Analysis; 7) Definition of Goods and Services Requirements; 8) Implementation Plan; and 9) Final Report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $364,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA). 

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report, is available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  Responsive bidders might be invited to interview with Grantee before any final selection is made.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, November 29, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is seeking solicitations of interest for the Weapons Evaluation Test Laborotory (WETL) construction project at the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, TX, roughly estimated at $8.5 Million.    

The WETL facility will be approximately 31,400 gross square feet, including approximately 21,000 sf of secure laboratory/testing areas.  The facility will include private and open office areas, computer support areas, video/teleconference presentation room, static free rooms, boom room, explosive lab, chemistry lab, electronics testing areas, two belowground high speed centrifuge areas (centrifuge equipment by Government) and miscellaneous support spaces.  The facility has been designed and will be constructed using The Green Building Council's LEED's criteria for sustainable design and will be submitted for certification. Facility commissioning will be required.

The WETL will be a steel-framed structure with slab on grade concrete flooring, outside of centrifuge areas, and open-web steel roof joists. A reinforced concrete floor will be provided over the centrifuge areas. Foundations will be individual spread footings with cast-in-place grade beams.  Cast in place concrete walls and floors are used for the belowground centrifuge levels.  The facility will require material hoists, a bridge crane and blast resistant wall/door construction for various spaces. Roofing will be steel deck with built-up roofing. Exterior skin will be factory fabricated, preinsulated metal sandwich panels.  The facility will utilize variable air volume air handling systems with packaged rooftop DX cooling with hot water heating and hot water terminal units. Miscellaneous exhaust systems will be required. Plumbing systems will consist of sanitary, domestic hot and cold water, compressed air and liquid CO2 distribution systems. Facility will be provided with both wet and dry-pipe sprinkler systems. Electrical systems will consist of primary power, telecommunications, public address, security, fire detection/alarm, video teleconferencing, centrifuge access control and monitoring, operations monitoring, oxygen monitoring and other miscellaneous support systems. 

The below grade levels will support two large high-speed centrifuges to be relocated by the Government.  The successful Contractor will be responsible for coordinating centrifuge installation requirements with the Government's Specialty Contractors. The facility will be provided with power and HVAC systems to support the high heat dissipation and electrical requirements of the Government's test equipment.  

BWXT Pantex, LLC, operates the Pantex Plant; however SNL will operate the WETL facility and will be the contracting agency for procurement and administration of the construction contract. BWXT will support SNL in the areas of construction inspections and Pantex Plant construction requirements. Hayes, Seay, Mattern & Mattern, Inc. of Roanoke, VA is the architect-engineer and will provide shop drawing reviews and other construction phase services in support of SNL.

The majority of construction site is outside of the existing high security areas at the Pantex Plant, which will allow the majority of the construction to be completed under minimal security requirements. Work within the higher security areas to relocate existing equipment, install temporary fencing and to connect to existing utilities will need to be completed in accordance with the Pantex Plant security requirements. Prior to project completion the facility will be incorporated into the high security area.


A fixed price construction contract is anticipated to be awarded in January 2003, with an anticipated 70 week schedule for completion. All interested firms should submit a letter of interest, which includes demonstrated capability of meeting the criteria in this announcement, together with ten (10) copies of their qualifications. The qualficiations submittal should include descriptions of past jobs of similar scope and complexity with contact names to verify contractor performance.  The qualifications submittal is limited to 10 double-sided pages.  The submittals will be evaluated by a committee of WETL project team personnel, who will "shortlist" based on the following criteria (listed in order of importance).

1.	Similar Experience by the Construction contractor - Project specific relevance to the WETL Facility (include references for each project).  List no more than 3 projects.

2.	Management Plan and Approach - Discuss your strategy for staffing this project.  Include Project Manager, Superintendent, Safety officer, Commissioning agent, discipline leads and key support personnel roles, responsibilities and interfaces, including project team organization and overall management plan.

3.	Experience of Team Members - Professional Designation/Certification/Education and Technical Experience (It is expected that team members identified in the proposal will perform the work and will be involved throughout the WETL project). 

4.	Quality Management - Internal QA Process.

5.	Methodology and Performance of Cost Estimating, Schedule and Cost Control.  Include experience with P3 Project Planner.  This will be required during the Construction Phase.

  
Only those "shortlisted" will receive the actual Request for Quotation (RFQ).  All qualification submittals must be delivered in writing, organized and tabulated per the listed criteria sequence. No telephone or fax proposals will be accepted. Proposals are due by 3:00 p.m. MST, November 11, 2002. Submittals and any questions should be directed to Sandia National Laboratories, Attention: Jimmy Romero, mail stop 0222, 1515 Eubank SE Albuquerque, New Mexico 87123-0222.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation (F17EMS22590500) is issued as a request for quotations.  This solicitation as well as all provisions and clauses are current through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-08.  Date of delivery is 180 days after receipt of order and FOB point is 7 EMS, Dyess AFB, TX 79607.  Offers are due to 7th Contracting Squadron, 381 3rd St, Dyess AFB, TX 79607 not later than 1630 or 4:30 P.M. central standard time on 6 November 2002.  This is for the purposes of procuring tail maintenance stands for use on the B-1 Bomber.  Dyess B-1 Maintenance Flight is in need of better work stands to enable maintenance personnel to have better access to the aircraft.  The stands shall be constructed of modular units with easy upgrading, low maintenance and easy maneuverability with workers safety in mind at all times.  There will be a SITE VISIT on 25 October 2002 at 0900 hours or 9 A.M central standard time.  All offerors will be REQUIRED to submit conceptual drawings at time of quote submission.  Failure to do so will result in offeror being disqualified.  The following are a few guidelines 7th EMS is looking for in the wing maintenance stands.

The stands must be designed to meet or exceed the direction found in ?AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 21-101 AEROSPACE EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT (01 FEB 2002),: ?AIR FORCE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS 91-2 VEHICLE ELEVATING AND ROTATING WORK PLATFORMS, MANUALLY-PROPELLED AND SELF PROPELLED MOBILE WORK PLATFORMS, AND SCAFFOLDS (TOWERS) (01 AUG 1997), ?AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 91-301 AIR COMBAT COMMAND SUPPLEMENT 1 AIR FORCE OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY, FIRE PREVENTION, AND HEALTH (AFOSH) PROGRAM (04 DEC 1997).  

Units must be entirely constructed of non-corrosive lightweight steel/aluminum.  Each unit must be mobile and easily moved and positioned by four people or less.  Units will have manually operated vertical movement jacks allowing a minimum of 18 inches of variable height adjustments for platform leveling. Stands will allow access to the tail section of the B-1 aircraft from approximately 6 feet forward of the Mixer bays to the aft section of lower rudder. They should also allow personnel to walk under the horizontal stabilizers to allow maintenance.

Stands should allow movement and positioning of a universal maintenance stand at the aft of aircraft and also allow for the removal of aircraft engines.

The casters should swivel 360 degrees with 90 degree locking points and manually operated foot brakes.  Tires should be made of solid polyurethane molded to the cast wheel. Step-fast jacks should also be used to take out any caster movement when stands are in position.  

Segment should be approximately 30 feet long by 20 feet wide providing approximately 600 square feet of usable workspace.  Tail sections should be no more than one section per side and no more than two stages, it should also allow walking from one side of the aircraft to the other (bridge from stand to stand with hand rails) without dismounting.  Segments must provide access to the Stab, lower rudders and flight control bays (mixer-bay).  Each segment will be capable of holding a minimum of six 200-pound individuals.  Each segment shall have collapsible handrails for fall protection.  There will be toe-boards a minimum of 4 inches high surrounding the work decks to prevent small items from rolling or being kicked over the edge.  The interface edge between the aircraft and the work deck will be adjustable to allow for aircraft contour and will not have toe-boards.  The adjustable edge-mating surface must be covered in a non-marking rubber material to prevent damage to the aircraft skin (each fingers will extend 2-3 ft).

Stands must be sturdy enough to be towed by a small vehicle as they are used in different hangars on base for stab removals.  Each stand must have a tow bar attachment (tow bar must be able to receive a pindle hook type of attachment).

Each stand will have access stairs to the work platform.  The stairs should allow for treads to remain in the horizontal position when the deck height is raised or lowered.  Each stair should have handrails fitted to each side.  There should also be a hand-operated jack to remove any movement of the stair casters.  Stair treads should be lightweight and the facing edge of the treads and top landing must be highlighted with yellow paint.

Operating instructions will be clearly defined on signs located close to the relevant piece of equipment, such as jacks.

The work decks, walkways and stairways will be of non-slip construction or coating.  All base beam plates at low level will have rounded corners.

All dimensions provided are approximate.  Final dimensions of units will be determined at a site visit.

Final product must be delivered in a near complete state.  No welding will be allowed on site.  Total assembly time allowed at destination will be 2 weeks.

This project is SET ASIDE 100% for SMALL BUSINESS INTERESTS.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 333518 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. Award will be based lowest price, technical acceptability and past performance, with price slightly more important than technical acceptability and past performance.  However, those proposals that are deemed technically unacceptable will be labeled non-responsive.  Quotes must be accompanied by a simple technical representation of the final product.  Paper copies of this solicitation are not available. It is anticipated that the following viewers will be needed to view this solicitation: Microsoft Word (.doc), Adobe Acrobat Reader (.pdf), WinZip (.zip or .exe) to be able to view the solicitation documents.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION IS TO PROVIDED CLARIFICATION TO THE ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS POSTED ON August 12, 2002.

The requirement is to procure an Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS) and related supplies and services for the CH-46E aircraft. The primary components of AIMS are an onboard Processor Unit, a Display Unit, and miscellaneous aircraft installation components. AIMS is a consolidation of support equipment functions, a majority of which are currently performed by the Chadwick-Helmuth 8500C or Chadwick-Helmuth VXP Balancer/Analyzer. 
An additional function of AIMS will be engine data acquisition. AIMS, when installed in the CH-46E aircraft, will provide for integrated rotor track and balance capability, continuous monitoring of vibration levels of all dynamic components and engine performance parameters. AIMS will also provide for future implementation of aircrew in-flight warnings for basic vibration exceedances and engine parameter exceedances. The benefits of an onboard monitoring system include the preservation of aircraft structure and electronic components life, tremendous reductions in maintenance man-hours due to enhanced trouble shooting /fault isolation and the elimination of ground support equipment requirements. The requirement includes the aircraft kits, ancillary hardware, and engineering services necessary to upgrade CH-46E aircraft.

The Government intends to procure these items on a sole source basis with Chadwick-Helmuth Company, El Monte, California. Chadwick-Helmuth was selected and qualified by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Boeing Helicopter, as the source for the 8500C Balancer/Analyzer, previous generation of the VXP Balancer/Analyzer. AIMS will use the same proven algorithms as developed for the 8500C and VXP systems. Since AIMS is simply the latest generation of the equipment we are already using with a few additional functions/capabilities, Chadwick-Helmuth is the only company that can meet the government?s needs within the timeframe required. The knowledge and experience on CH-46E rotor track and balance and vibration analysis resides at Chadwick-Helmuth. In addition, they own the proprietary data for the current systems that are being adapted for on aircraft monitoring vice routine maintenance being performed with support equipment. The duration of the BOA will be through October 2005.

The requirement is to procure Aircraft Integrated Maintenance Rotor Track and Balance systems (?AIMS systems?), and related supplies and services for the CH-46E Helicopter.  It includes aircraft kits, ancillary hardware, and engineering and technical services necessary to upgrade CH-46E aircraft.  The main components of the aircraft kit include: AIMS Processor Unit, Acquisition Control Unit, Memory Card, Sensors, Aircraft Installation components and Ground Software.  This product is an adaptation of the existing VXP Balancer/Analyzer previously procured from Chadwick-Helmuth for the CH-46E.   The AIMS monitoring system when installed in the CH-46E aircraft will provide continuous monitoring of rotor track and balance data, vibration levels of all rotating pumps and drive shafts and will provide aircraft crew and maintainers immediate feedback of the aircraft operating condition and engine performance. The Government intends to procure these items on a sole source basis with Chadwick-Helmuth Company, El Monte, California, which is the designer, developer, and sole manufacturer of the Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System and the only known company with the knowledge, experience, and technical data required to fulfill this need.  Chadwick-Helmuth was selected and qualified by the Original Equipment Maintenance (OEM), Boeing Helicopter, as the source for the 8500C Balancer/Analyzer is currently being used for the CH-46.  The AIMS rotor tracker and balance system function will be performed using the same proven algorithms as developed for the 8500C system.  The duration of the BOA will be through October 2005.  note 22.

<SOLNBR>DAAE30-03-R-0303
<RESPDATE>110102
<CONTACT>Mary Beth Forte, Contracting Officer, 973-724-4012
<DESC>The Office of the Product Manager for Mortars is seeking proven producers with extensive experience and facilities in place to provide 60mm Mortar Cartridge M27 Fins.  First Article Test is required to be performed approximately 5 months after contract award and production lots to be delivered on thirty day intervals commencing 7-10 months after award.  The quantity in each production lot is estimated to be a quantity up to 10,000 M27 Fins per month. The M27 fins is a canted 6 Bladed One Piece Fin used on the rear of a number to 60mm Mortar Cartridges to stabilize the Mortar Cartridge in flight.  Manufacturers need to possess expertise in machining materials to reasonably tight tolerances (e.g.+/-0.0025 inch) and conducting specialized tests such as hydrostatic testing (approx. 18 KPSI).  The fin is approximately 5.5 inches long and has a maximum outside diameter of 2 3/8 inches.  The fins are made from extruded aluminum alloy (two material choices are permitted with a minimum strength of approx. 40 KSI).  The ID of the fin is not completely hollow, therefore, the ability to bore is required as is the ability to drill a series of flash holes perpendicular to the centerline of the fin.  Due to the  configuration of the fin, a significant amount of the machine work required will involve interrupted cuts. This is a sources sought notice for planning purposes only.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal and does not obligate the government to issue a solicitation.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement.  All responding sources must submit their responses no later than 01 November 2002, 1630 Hourse (Local Time), to:  Rhonda Chuchwa, U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC, Attn: SFAE-AMO-CAS-MS, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.

<DESC>The Projects Division, Precision Strike System Programs Office (WMGD) is issuing a sources sought for new or modified warhead leading to a production of approximately 350 All-Up-Rounds (AUR).  They are seeking capable sources with demonstrated past performance to accomplish this effort.  This program is scheduled to begin in FY03 with two years to design, develop, and test a new or modified warhead leading to a production of approximately 350 All-Up-Rounds (AUR) beginning in FY05.  The objective of this effort is to increase the penetration, survivability, and lethality of the current design to improve the capability in defeating hard targets.  Survivability areas to be addressed are: fuze mounting hardware, payload, and case.  The resultant warhead will be incorporated into the EGBU-28 system with minimal impact to operations and logistic support.  There will be no changes to the guidance and tail kits other than minor changes to adapters, lanyards, and other miscellaneous hardware required to accommodate potential reshaping of the warhead.  The objective is to stay within the mass properties of the existing BLU-113 warhead; however, nominal changes to mass properties may be permitted as long as those changes do not require a full flight certification program, and do not impact the guidance system.  The designated launch platforms are the F-15E and B2 aircraft and shall require no modifications to accommodate the resultant system.  Responses to this sources sought will be used by the government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  The government has developed candidate concepts for improved penetration, survivability, and lethality.  These concepts will be made available for consideration upon issuance of the Request For Proposal (RFP).

<SOLNBR>N0017803Q1001
<RESPDATE>121502
<CONTACT>XDS113 at (540)653-7478
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), is seeking sources for the design and manufacture of an inflatable lifting surface.  The lifting surface is to be used in conjunction with a mission responsive ordnance (MRO) submunition for the purpose of providing enhanced maneuverability.  An inflatable lifting surface system is desired as opposed to a conventional rigid wing due to limited volumetric packaging constraints.  When inflated, the wing should be able to provide five g's of lateral acceleration to the submunition at sea level at 600 ft/sec.  The submunition weighs approximately 100 pounds.   The time required to inflate the wing should not exceed one second, and a more desirable inflation time would be .5 seconds or less.  The wing must also be able to withstand the aerodynamic loading, resisting buckling and flutter.  Preliminary estimates show that a m aximum of 75 cubic inches will be available for packaging on each side of the submunition airframe.  A feasibility study is desired for the first phase of this program.  Interested sources should submit a white paper detailing a proposed feasibility/trade study.  A Rough Order of Magnitude estimate should also be submitted.  The submitted information should allow technical NSWCDD personnel to assess the feasibility, performance, affordability, and risk associated with an inflatable wing system.  Assuming that the results of the first phase assessment are found to be acceptable, additional follow on phases will be planned.  The second phase will involve the construction of a prototype wing, which will be tested in a wind tunnel.  A third phase would consist of the incorporation of the inflatable wing system into the submunition, followed by a flight test.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUG HT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOCUMENTATION SUBMITTED FOR THIS INFORMATION.  All interested parties shall forward the specified documentation on or before 29 November 2002 to: Contracting Officer, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Attn: Code XDS113/Bldg 183/Room 102, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5100 and reference Sources Sought Announcement Number N00178-03-Q-1001.

<SUBJECT>99 -- PROPOSED ADDITIONS TO THE COMMITTEE''S PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company?s overall financial status.  

Items being considered are: 1) Batteries (6135-00-826-4798; 6135-00-900-2139; 6135-00-985-7845; 6135-00-985-7846; and 6135-00-835-7210).  2) Four-Ply Cut End Mopheads (7920-00-NIB-0430; 7920-00-NIB-0431; 7920-00-NIB-0432; 7920-00-NIB-0434; and 7920-00-NIB-0435).  3) Dual Head Stethoscope (6515-00-NIB-0115).

In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm?s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 

To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 

When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.  Reply by November 11, 2002.

Beers Skanska was originally selected under the Source Selection procedures to construct the New U.S. Courthouse under Contract No:  GS-04P-99-EXC-0019.  Construction services to be provided under this new contract include:  demolition and construction for the existing space build-out on the 6th floor to accommodate the Tax Court.  Beers Skanska is currently completing original contract work in the remainder of the building.  Beers is still mobilized and constructing the courthouse where the renovated work will be performed.  The Systems in the space to be renovated are currently under Beers warranty, utilizing another contractor could possibly void the warranty.  Beers Skanska and their subcontractors possess unique and intricate knowledge of the new courthouse architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical building components and are therefore best qualified and are available to perform this urgent work.  The expedited performance expected through their unique project knowledge and extensive documentation of current conditions would result in less risk and cost to the federal government.  The requirement to procure these additional services under full and open competition would result in a high cost risk, to acquire a level of knowledge that the present construction contractor already has due to the experience gained while constructing the new courthouse.  Therefore, this procurement is planned as Other Than Full and Open Competition based on the grounds that Beers Skanska is the only practical firm that can provide these construction services expeditiously and economically.  The total estimated range for this construction service is approximately Four Hundred Thousand Dollars.  Firms who believe that they must question the government's intent to award this project under Other Than Full and Open Competition or obtain additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to:  General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Property Development Division, 401 W. Peachtree Street, NW, Attn:  Margie King (Contracting Officer), Suite 2500 (4PCA), Atlanta, GA  30308.  Any written comments are to be received by the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the publication of this notice of intent.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Cushioning Systems for Crashworthy/Ejection Seating Systems
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR NEW OR PROVEN CUSHIONING TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS THAT COULD ENHANCE OCCUPANT CRASH PROTECTION FOR NAVAL EJECTION SEATS, CRASHWORTHY SEATING SYSTEMS, AND FIXED SEATS.  The Aircrew Escape and Crashworthy Systems Fleet Support team (NAVAIR PMA ?202J) / Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division is requesting information (RFI) from potential sources for the following specific requirements.  The U.S. Navy is interested in information regarding new or proven cushioning technologies and products that could enhance occupant crash protection for Naval ejection seats, crashworthy seating systems, and fixed seats.  The technologies and products would need to be capable of being developed and integrated into existing and future Naval and joint service vehicles.  Of particular interest are innovative approaches that could increase occupant crash protection, and survivability at mishap scenarios, support ejection loads, meet ergonomic and physiological considerations, and meet applicable federal/military regulations. Also of particular interest are systems that could be deployed with reduced cost and weight penalties when compared to conventional approaches.  Examples of the types of technologies and products sought include the following:

Cushioning systems that could improve occupant crash protection, relieve long mission fatigue, and reduce long-term injuries.  Systems that could reduce the vertical component of ejection and/or crash accelerations transmitted to aircrew and passengers and enhancement of ergonomic design should be considered.  

Cushioning systems that will compliment/enhance the performance of ejection-seating systems.  Systems that could improve ejection load absorption and restraint for ejection seat equipped aircraft; loads incurred during mishaps or high G maneuvers.  Systems that will minimize fatigue and increase comfort during long missions.  

Systems that could reduce the probability and severity of head, torso, and limb contact injuries and fatigue for crashworthy/ejection seats.  Concepts are sought that could complement or enhance the performance of existing occupant restraint systems.  

Systems that could retain or enhance current cockpit ergonomics, human factors considerations: anthropometrics, work-space envelopes, crewmember control clearances, grips, reach ability, visual display design-eyes criteria, restraint systems effectiveness, body posture, contouring, cushioning etc.

Systems that could facilitate the rapid post-crash emergency egress of aircrew and passengers in ground mishaps and over-water mishaps in which escape often occurs underwater, inverted, and in darkness.

Systems that maintain or enhance the reduction of resonance, damping frequency amplification, and vibration transmission effects resulting from vibrations encountered in long missions aboard turbo-propeller aircraft and high G maneuvers.

The Navy is interested in minimizing crew compartment accelerations and forces transmitted to the occupant during normal missions, to reduce occupants? chronic long-time injuries and disabilities, to enhance emergency ejection occupant?s protection, and reduce aircrew fatigue due to long missions with innovative design solutions.   

The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) is 541330.  Interested parties are requested to submit a brief one-page statement demonstrating their capability to perform the services listed above.  Interested sources should clarify if their product is commercially available or if the product would be a non-developmental item that could be modified to meet the governments needs.  Related information, brochures, photos, concept papers, copies of drawings, may be submitted to VegaRodrigZ@navair.navy.mil, or to the following address: Crashworthy and Escape Systems,  ATTN: Ms. Zoraida Vega Rodriguez , Code 4.6.2.2 Bldg 2187, Suite 1280-B8, NAVAIRSYSCOMHQ, 48110 Shaw Road, Unit 5, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1906.

<DESC>This announcement is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The referenced solicitation (RSJ-ACR2002) shall be issued as an request for quotation and contain incorporated provisions and clauses effective through the Federal Acquisition Circular 01-09 and applied under the associated NAICS Code: 541511.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistic Service has a requirement for disclosure analysis consultant services.  These services are to provide network./minimum cost flow disclosure limitation methodology to census programs within the Dept. of Agriculture.  The necessary application of this methodology requires knowledgeable use of a highly technical mathematical technique that is used to protect confidentiality of respondent data in large scale data products from the Census of Agriculture.  USDA plans to pursue a sole-source procurement with Robert S. Jewett, from Springfield, VA who is the author of several FORTRAN programs that will be utilized and is the only source known that is able to apply these complex methodologies to theoretically modify follow-on surveys. His expertise is derived from programming of the 1992 and 1997 Economic Census for the Dept. of Agriculture and he possesses a working knowledge of the agency's data structures as it relates to disclosure methodology.
