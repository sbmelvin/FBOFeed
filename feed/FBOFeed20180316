In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.
20.   Buyer name, phone#, and email address   Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer William J. Stephenson, 405-739-9077, william.stephenson.4@us.af.mil.

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-18-01784 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) hereby announces its intent to award a sole source contract to Solomon Park Research Laboratories, Inc., 658 S. 152nd. Street, Burien, WA 98148-1111 for the acquisition of whole units of serum and pooled serum consisting of single donor bulk units and serum pools in vials.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 621991, Blood and Organ Banks with a size standard of $32,500,000.00. The period of performance for this procurement is 90 days.</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this procurement is to purchase whole units of serum and pooled serum consisting of single donor bulk units and serum pools in vials along with shipping materials from Solomon Park Research Laboratories, Inc. The CDC Clinical Standardization Programs (CLSI) serve as the international reference point for clinical measurements. These programs use ONLY C37A materials that are value-assigned by the reference laboratories at CDC and then are used to assess the performance of participating assay manufacturers and clinical laboratories. Only Solomon Park Research Laboratories is certified to provide the materials meeting the CLSI C37A requirements for collection and storage of commutable, high quality serum necessary for the highly selective sample analysis of lipids in human serum, and for use in trueness control and calibration studies which are ongoing in the CDC Clinical Standardization Programs. Serum used in these programs must be collected off-the-clot on ice to minimize enzymatic degradation or alteration of serum units in order to replicate serum collection in tubes used in patient care, without the addition anticoagulants, additives or stabilizers as required by CLSI C37A. The preparation of these samples to these specific requirements can only be met by Solomon Park Research Laboratories for this program. There is currently no other company or individual that has the ability to provide serum materials that have a minimal matrix alteration and such preparations have been shown to be commutable across various measurement procedures, and it is critical in continuation of our CDC standardization activities and efforts. Solomon Park Research Laboratories is the only vendor who is certified and able to provide the required materials recommended for use in trueness control and calibration studies which are ongoing in the CDC Clinical Standardization Programs.</p>

<p>This agency proposes to issue a solicitation for a long-term strategic/sole source contract which will include multiple NSNs to support the UH-60 weapon systems. A total of 9 NSNs are targeted to be added or repriced for this contract effort. The proposed sole source action will be issued to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE): 78286 and is intended to be on a sole source basis as supported by a J&amp;A IAW FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". Items provided by the following Sikorsky CAGE codes covered by this acquisition: 78286.</p>
<p>The proposed requirement will be for a total of three (3) years period of performance. Letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified OEM. This is proposed to be a FAR 15 effort. The attached lists of NSNs are the items that have been identified for this current action. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately.</p>
<p>These items are being added to contract SPE4AX-15-D-9415, a firm fixed price with price redetermination Indefinite Quantity Contract, awarded to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation CAGE Code: 78286 in accordance with the originally approved J&amp;A. However, the NSNs identified here were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort. The contract requires supply of parts, as well as other functions including but not limited to inventory management, forecasting, distribution, storage, reliability improvements, engineering maintenance and design control affecting these parts.</p>

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<BR><BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010)
(a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at:

E-mail:____________________
(b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows:
(1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract.
(2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor.<BR><BR>Insert the clause 1352.209–73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts.
As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507–2(c), insert the following clause:
Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010)
The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507–2(d), insert the following clause:
Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:
(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and
(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.
(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as “contractor”) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.
(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<BR><BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms “contract,” “contractor,” and “Contracting Officer” shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507–1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:

NAVSUP Weapons Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Mechanicsburg will be placing a repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Communications  and  Power Industries – Microwave Power Products Division, CAGE 99313, Palo Alto, CA, for repair of various Electron Tubes.  The scope of work, which may include the acquisition of piece parts, is for the restoration of depot level repairables in support of various platforms, including Mk 92 FCS and Mk 86 GFCS. The restored items will be returned to the supply system for stock for immediate Fleet use.  Several items to be restored are:  Electron Tube, NSN 7HH 5960-01-373-5313, Electron Tube, NSN 7HH 5960-00-906-6087, and Electron Tube, NSN 7HH 5960-00-450-2229.
  

Technical data is not available and cannot be furnished.  All items on the BOA require Government source-approval prior to contract award, since the items are critical and the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair by other than Communications  and  Power Industries – Microwave Power Products Division. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  

The POC is Nicholas Stellhorn 717-605-1457, Email: Nicholas.Stellhorn@navy.mil

Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<BR><BR>

<DESC><br /><strong>Multi-Discipline Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services for Military and Interagency &amp; International Services (IIS) Projects throughout the Seattle District, U.S, Army Corps of Engineers Boundaries (WA, OR, ID, and MT)</strong>
<p><br />1. <strong>CONTRACT INFORMATION:</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> This announcement for IDIQ A-E services is for at least three (3) Large A-E Firms and at least three (3) Small Business A-E Firms. Note below there is separate criteria for Large A-E Firms and the Small Business A-E Firms. When submitting a response, indicate which business size your firm is being considered for.</span></p>
<p>This contract is being procured in accordance with Public Law 92-582 (the "Brooks Act") as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award multiple full and open competition IDIQ A-E contracts. Selection of multiple A-Es under this acquisition will create two A-Es groups, consisting of a small business A-E group and a large business A-E group, sharing the $45,000,000 ($45.0M) total contract capacity. Each group will consist of at least three (3) A-E firms, resulting in the award of A-E contracts to at least six (6) firms. Under the IDIQ contracts, project-level requirements will be scoped for selection, negotiation, and award as firm-fixed-price (FFP) Task Orders. If the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that the number of awarded contracts should be adjusted based upon the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all. These IDIQ contracts will have a maximum period of performance of five (5) years (a one-year base period and four (4) option periods of 1 year each).</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is <strong>541330</strong> for Engineering Services (primary) and <strong>541310</strong> for Architectural Services (secondary). Firms must be capable of providing support for program requirements for military (DoD) and IIS (non-DoD) planning, studies, design, and design support during construction. The A-E services will be primarily for military projects at U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and other DoD agency sites and secondarily for non-DoD project sites for various federal agencies within the NWS area of responsibility, which covers Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana.</p>
<p>The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing work under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employee's office location (not the location of work).</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must have a DUNS number from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) and be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). For information in regard to opening a SAM account, see the following link for instructions:</p>
<p>https://www.sam.gov/sam/transcript/Quick_Guide_for_Contract_Registrations_v1.7.pdf</p>
<p>Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov or by calling (866) 606-8220.</p>
<p>2. <strong>PROJECT INFORMATION:</strong> The A-E will be required to prepare design analyses, drawings, specifications, and cost estimates, as required, for a variety of major projects using current Army, Air Force, Corps of Engineers and other DoD and non-DoD agency standards. A-E services may be required for one or more project phases, including project initiation and plan development, project definition, bid packages with full design (specifications, drawings) for design-bid-build (DBB) contracts and/or requests for proposal (RFPs) for design/build (D/B) contracts, design support services during construction, and other services as required by the Government. Service capabilities will be required for architectural, landscaping, civil, mechanical, electrical and structural engineering. The ability to prepare designs using Building Information Modeling (BIM) meeting U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force standards is a requirement. Incidental asbestos and lead paint survey work may be required relating to the design services.</p>
<p>Services will be accomplished in the contractor's office with the exception of field investigations and field surveys required at the individual project sites. The Government will not provide any direct supervision of the A-E employees.</p>
<p>Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract ordering period. Task order awards will be FFP-type orders. The period of performance on individual task orders will not exceed three (3) years, unless otherwise approved by the Procuring Contracting Officer. The total contract amount will not exceed $45.0M in shared contract capacity. The minimum and maximum task order amounts are, respectively, $2,500.00 and $2.0M for large and small business A-E firms, unless otherwise approved by the Procuring Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Per 10 U.S.C &sect; 2855, military task orders that surpass the threshold amount of $400,000 require an unrestricted selection process. This procurement provides for work below that threshold to be reserved for small business set-asides. In addition, the proposed contracts will include task orders for similar project types and dollar ranges for non-DoD agencies requiring A-E services for planning, design, and support during construction. The threshold amount does not apply to non-DoD agencies. The most highly qualified A-E firm for the current task order requirement(s) is determined in compliance with FAR 36.6 procedures.</p>
<p><strong>3. SELECTION CRITERIA:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Offerors shall identify the A-E group (small or large business) for which the firm is submitting their SF330 for consideration.</strong> Firms are not allowed to submit for both groups or for a group which does not match their firm size. For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business for NAICS 541330 if its annual gross receipts are $15 million or less.</p>
<p>&#61558; <strong>SMALL BUSINESS A-E SELECTION CRITERIA:</strong></p>
<p>Selection of the <strong>small business A-E group</strong> will be based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance, first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion, if applicable. Criteria A through E are primary and will be evaluated for all offerors.</p>
<p>Criteria F through H will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal, most highly qualified firms in the <strong>small business A-E group.</strong> The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The three secondary selection criterion are listed below in order of descending importance (higher level criterion will be evaluated first, and others considered only if required).</p>
<p><strong>Primary Criterion A - Specialized experience and technical competence</strong> of the proposed firm(s) in a broad range of military and non-DoD projects:</p>
<p>1. Planning (DD1391 validation, charrette, Project Definition Report, Value Engineering).</p>
<p>2. Design (all phases through full design-bid build or design-build packages), listed in descending order of importance:<br />&bull; Administrative, training, and physical fitness facilities.<br />&bull; Hangars, maintenance facilities, and warehouses.<br />&bull; Community centers, education centers, youth/child development centers.<br />&bull; Barracks, quarters or dormitories, and short-term lodging facilities.<br />&bull; Site infrastructure (streets and highways, access controls, parking) and utilities.</p>
<p>3. A-E support during construction for military projects.</p>
<p>Additional considerations:</p>
<p>&bull; Projects in which the small business team demonstrated prior project experience working together in significant prime/sub-consultant roles may be evaluated more favorably for this criteria.</p>
<p>&bull; Projects completed on a military installation and those requiring anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) criteria knowledge may be evaluated more favorably for this criteria. Projects completed for non-DoD agencies, with similar requirements to the range of military projects described above, may be submitted as experience, but will not be evaluated more favorably.</p>
<p>&bull; Projects that included building information modeling, underground utilities information modeling, and sustainability may also be evaluated more favorably.</p>
<p>Firms will be evaluated for experience and competence. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections F, G, and Part II - General Qualifications of the SF330.</p>
<p>A maximum of <strong>ten (10)</strong> projects awarded to and/or completed by the proposed Team no more than 5 years prior to submission, including joint ventures and teaming partners, shall be shown in Section F. For the 10 projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed at one site or at a single installation. An Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) is not a project. A project may contain multiple task orders or contracts if they are for multiple phases of the project at the same site or installation. Project descriptions shall clearly state extent of work performed by the team, extent of work completed, and dates of completion.</p>
<p>If the offeror provides a specific task order as its "project," provide the base contract number(s) and the task order number(s) for reference purposes. If the offeror provides a site-specific contract as its "project," provide the contract number. If the offeror provides more than 10 example projects, only the first 10 examples will be evaluated.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Criterion B - Professional qualifications</strong> of a firm's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract. The education, training, professional registration, proposed job title, overall and relevant military and non-DoD design experience, longevity with the firm, and experience of key personnel will be considered. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel identified by the A-E and not the number of personnel, which is addressed under Criterion D - Capacity. The number of key personnel employed by the small business Prime/JV may be evaluated more favorably for this criteria.</p>
<p>Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in key disciplines:</p>
<p>&bull; Key professional disciplines are identified below by function code (fc):</p>
<p>&#61607; Descriptions by fc correspond to "List of Disciplines (Function Codes)" in the SF330 Instructions; where a function code does not exist, the requirement is described by the Government.<br />&#61607; Identify key personnel proposed by fc in Sections E, G, and H of the SF330.<br />&#61607; List professional registrations or certifications, if applicable, for the key disciplines; professional registration is required for disciplines (1) through (10), with the exception that nationally-recognized cost engineering certifications are acceptable for (7) Cost Engineers and LEED certifications are acceptable for (9) Sustainable Design.</p>
<p>&bull; Key professional disciplines required, listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>1. Project Managers (fc 48);<br />2. Quality Control Managers (no fc; self-identify QC role(s), qualifications, and specific staff);<br />3. Architects (fc 06);<br />4. Civil Engineers (fc 12) and Structural Engineers (fc 57);<br />5. Electrical Engineers (fc 21),<br />6. Mechanical Engineers (fc 42);<br />7. Cost Engineers (fc 18);<br />8. Fire Protection Engineers (fc 25);<br />9. Sustainable Design (no fc; LEED certification required, self-identify sustainable design roles and specific staff); and;<br />10. Communications Engineers (fc 13).</p>
<p>&bull; Responses must be coordinated with Part II, subpart 9, "Employees by Discipline."</p>
<p>The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections E, G, and H of the SF330.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Criterion C - Past Performance</strong> on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, management/business relations, and compliance with performance schedules. Evaluations used for source selection purposes are obtained from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) ratings are the primary source of information on past performance. PPIRS will be queried for all firms submitting an SF330. Each project in Section F of the SF330 shall include project owner's contact information. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors may also be considered. The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm, if none is available from PPIRS.</p>
<p>The board will first consider the relevancy of each performance evaluation on A-E services contracts to the proposed contract, including the type of work, performing office, age of the evaluation, and whether subsequent evaluations indicate a change in a firm's performance. Past performance ratings for projects completed on a military installation and those requiring antiterrorism/force protection (AT/FP) criteria knowledge are considered more relevant. The board will then rate the confidence of the firm based on the ratings of its past performance, with an emphasis on quality of work, cost control, and compliance with performance schedules, and the extent to which past projects were performed by proposed key personnel. The end result will be a combined relevancy/confidence rating (e.g., Relevant/Substantial Confidence).</p>
<p>If no relevant past performance information is available on a firm, the firm will be given a neutral confidence evaluation regarding past performance.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Criterion D - Capacity of key disciplines.</strong> The board will consider available capacity of key disciplines identified above (Criterion B) for the Team to perform work in the required time. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H (e.g., a table summary of total Team capacity for each key discipline) and Part II of the SF330. Function code (fc) and descriptions must correspond to "List of Disciplines (Function Codes)" in the SF330 Instructions. Where a function code does not exist, the requirement is described by the Government. Responses must be coordinated with Part II, subpart 9, "Employees by Discipline".</p>
<p><strong>Primary Criterion E - Knowledge of the Locality.</strong> The board will evaluate the Team's familiarity with local conditions, specifically demonstrating (1) knowledge and experience dealing with geological features, and (2) the state/ local regulatory agencies in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and Montana. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located throughout NWS. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF330.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Criterion F - Extent of Small Business participation.</strong> (Not used.)</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Criterion G - Geographical Proximity</strong> to the USACE Seattle District office and its engineering and construction personnel located in the covered states (Idaho, Oregon, Montana, and Washington). The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF330.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Criterion H - Volume of DoD Contract Awards in the last 12 Months.</strong> Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract awarded within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms, including SB and SDB. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF330.</p>
<p>&#61558; <strong>LARGE BUSINESS A-E SELECTION CRITERIA:</strong></p>
<p>Selection of the <strong>large business A-E group</strong> will be based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance, first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion, if applicable. Additional consideration will be given for experience and qualifications by the Prime/Joint Venture (JV) A-E firm. Criteria A through E are primary and will be evaluated for all offerors.</p>
<p>Criteria F through H will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal, most highly qualified firms in the <strong>large business A-E group.</strong> The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The three secondary selection criterion are listed below in order of descending importance (higher level criterion will be evaluated first, and others considered only if required).</p>
<p><strong>Primary Criterion A - Specialized experience and technical competence</strong> of the Prime/JV firm in a broad range of military and non-DoD projects:</p>
<p>1. Planning (DD1391 validation, charrette, Project Definition Report, Value Engineering).</p>
<p>2. Design (all phases through full design-bid build or design-build packages), listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>&bull; Administrative, training, and physical fitness facilities<br />&bull; Hangars, maintenance facilities, and warehouses<br />&bull; Community centers, education centers, youth/child development centers.<br />&bull; Barracks, quarters or dormitories, and short-term lodging facilities<br />&bull; Site infrastructure (streets and highways, access controls, parking) and utilities.</p>
<p>3. A-E support during construction for military projects.</p>
<p>Additional considerations:</p>
<p>&bull; Projects in which the Prime/JV and its team sub-consultants demonstrated prior project experience working together in significant prime/sub-consultant roles may be evaluated more favorably for this criteria.</p>
<p>&bull; Projects completed on a military installation and those requiring anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) criteria knowledge may be evaluated more favorably for this criteria. Projects completed for non-DoD agencies, with similar requirements to the range of military projects described above, may be submitted as experience, but will not be evaluated more favorably.</p>
<p>&bull; Projects that included building information modeling, underground utilities information modeling, and sustainability may also be evaluated more favorably.</p>
<p>Firms will be evaluated for experience and competence. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections F, G, and Part II - General Qualifications of the SF330.</p>
<p>A maximum of <strong>ten (10)</strong> projects awarded to and/or completed by the Prime/JV no more than 5 years prior to submission, including joint ventures and teaming partners, shall be shown in Section F. For the ten projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed at one site or at a single installation. An Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) is not a project. A project may contain multiple task orders or contracts if they are for multiple phases of the project at the same site or installation. Project descriptions shall clearly state extent of work performed by the team, extent of work completed, and dates of completion.</p>
<p>If the offeror provides a specific task order as its "project," it shall provide the base contract number(s) and the task order number(s) for reference purposes. If the offeror provides a site-specific contract as its "project," it shall provide the contract number for reference purposes. If the offeror provides more than 10 example projects, only the first 10 examples will be evaluated.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Criterion B - Professional qualifications</strong> of a Prime/JV's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract. The education, training, professional registration, proposed job title, overall and relevant military and non-DoD design experience, longevity with the firm, and experience of key personnel will be considered. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel identified by the A-E and not the number of personnel, which is addressed under Criterion D - Capacity. The key personnel employed by the Prime/JV may be evaluated more favorably for this criteria.</p>
<p>Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in key disciplines:</p>
<p>&bull; Key professional disciplines are identified below by function code (fc):</p>
<p>&#61607; Descriptions by fc correspond to "List of Disciplines (Function Codes)" in the SF330 Instructions; where a function code does not exist, the requirement is described by the Government. <br />&#61607; Identify key personnel proposed by fc in Sections E, G, and H of the SF330.<br />&#61607; List professional registrations or certifications, if applicable, for the key disciplines; professional registration is required for disciplines (1) through (10), with the exception that nationally-recognized cost engineering certifications are acceptable for (7) Cost Engineers and LEED certifications are acceptable for (9) Sustainable Design.</p>
<p>&bull; Key professional disciplines required, listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>1. Project Managers (fc 48);<br />2. Quality Control Managers (no fc; self-identify QC role(s), qualifications, and specific staff);<br />3. Architects (fc 06);<br />4.

<p>&bull; Responses must be coordinated with Part II, subpart 9, "Employees by Discipline."</p>
<p>The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections E, G, and H of the SF330.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Criterion C - Past Performance</strong> on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, management/business relations, and compliance with performance schedules. Evaluations used for source selection purposes are obtained from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). Contractor Performance Assessment Reports System (CPARS) ratings are the primary source of information on past performance. PPIRS will be queried for all firms submitting an SF330. Each project in Section F of the SF330 shall include project owner's contact information. If deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors may also be considered. The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm, if none is available from PPIRS.</p>
<p>The board will first consider the relevancy of each performance evaluation on A-E services contracts to the proposed contract, including the type of work, performing office, age of the evaluation, and whether subsequent evaluations indicate a change in a firm's performance. Past performance ratings for projects completed on a military installation and those requiring antiterrorism/force protection (AT/FP) criteria knowledge are considered more relevant.

The end result will be a combined relevancy/confidence rating (e.g., Relevant/Substantial Confidence).</p>
<p>If no relevant past performance information is available on a firm, the firm will be given a neutral confidence evaluation regarding past performance.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Criterion D - Capacity of key disciplines.</strong> The board will consider available capacity of key disciplines identified above (Criterion B) for the Prime/JV and its team consultants to perform work in the required time. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H (e.g., a table summary of (1) Prime/JV and (2) total team capacity for each key discipline) and Part II of the SF330. Function code (fc) and descriptions must correspond to "List of Disciplines (Function Codes)" in the SF330 Instructions. Where a function code does not exist, the requirement is described by the Government. Responses must be coordinated with Part II, subpart 9, "Employees by Discipline".</p>
<p><strong>Primary Criterion E - Knowledge of the Locality:</strong> The board will evaluate the Team's familiarity with local conditions, specifically demonstrating (1) knowledge and experience dealing with geological features, and (2) the state/ local regulatory agencies in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and Montana. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located throughout NWS. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF330.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Criterion F - Extent of Small Business participation</strong> including Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions in the proposed contract team, measured as a percentage of the total estimated effort.</p>
<p>FAR 52.219-9 requirement for a large business is a subcontracting plan for parts of the work it intends to subcontract. The subcontracting minimum goals for the Seattle District in the negotiation of this contract follow:</p>

required by ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2007 (as well as previous versions back to
1999) and the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) (including versions back to
2003) for buildings over 5,000 square feet. The energy-saving intent of the requirement is to be
sure that unnecessary lights are turned off, such as those not needed after the end of the
business day. The requirement itself ensures that the control is available so that occupants can
set up automatic shutoff of lighting.

<DESC>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential manufacturing sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Nmarket research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited. <br /><br />The 422nd Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the manufacture of the NSN(s) listed below. The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement, inclusive of the need to do an Industry Day and/or Presolicitation Conference. The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. No qualification requirements exist. Consequently, potential sources for this effort typically would be companies who have a license or agreement with the Original Equipment Manufacturer Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation Cage: 97942 to complete the work described, including military specific modifications. <br /><br />The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 334511, which has a corresponding Size Standard of 1,500 employees. The Government is interested in all businesses to include, Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses 8(a)s, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Hubzone Businesses, and Women-Owned Small Businesses. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>In Vitro Affinity-based Diagnostic System for Diseases Resulting from Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Exposure</p>
<p>Objective: This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI. The Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (Medical Countermeasures Systems) is seeking information on the capabilities and willingness of private entities (academic, non-profit and commercial) in the areas listed below.</p>
<p>Briefly, the Medical Countermeasure Systems - Joint Product Lead for Diagnostics (MCS-DX) seeks responses that will inform future investments in diagnostics to complement current and planned polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based capabilities. Technologies should enable clinically-relevant diagnosis of chemical, biological, or radiological (CBR) warfare agent intoxication or infection at early points in disease progression. Of additional interest are systems that leverage or integrate with routine, non-CBR, healthcare capabilities to favor broader adoption across the services and enhance force readiness.</p>
<p>Background: <br />MCS-DX is responsible for the development, acquisition, and sustainment of FDA-cleared diagnostic devices intended for use by Service Members in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of exposure to CBR agents. Currently, MCS-DX is fielding a molecular assay (PCR) system for diagnosis of infection with a limited set of biological threats. However, there are instances where the molecular pathology of disease suggests PCR is not an effective methodology. Such a situation may arise with biological threats early in infection or with organisms that become compartmentalized and sequestered (e.g. in abscesses of internal organs) from easily accessible sample types. MCS-DX desires information regarding systems, and their components, that may address those instances.</p>
<p>Traditional and non-traditional defense contractors, including companies new to working with the DoD, are encouraged to respond. Companies currently in the U.S. domestic healthcare market, or considering entry into the FDA-cleared diagnostics market, are especially encouraged to respond. Respondents are invited to provide information related to their capabilities to fulfill any portion of the requirements listed below. Companies with an enabling technology that may serve as a component within a diagnostic system (e.g. clinical sample collection and preservation, sample preparation, assay designs, etc.) are encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>All proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security Classification markings.</p>
<p>Concept of Employment and Operational Environment</p>
<p>Capabilities developed and fielded by MCS-DX are intended for use by a variety of U.S. personnel in a range of deployed locations. A combat medic or physician assistant on the frontline may need to perform diagnostics in a fairly uncontrolled environment, such as a Battalion Aid Station tent. Further from the frontline, yet still "in theatre", a dedicated laboratory technician of a 50-bed combat support hospital may need to perform diagnostics of all levels of complexity in a controlled operational environment, not unlike many Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratories.</p>
<p>Service Members are evacuated through this combat health support system depending on severity of illness and assessed ability to return to duty. As such, clinical sampling and field diagnostic testing is likely to occur between 0 and 168 hours after acute symptom onset. Additionally, CBR diagnostics are used in parallel with, and are subservient to, routine combat casualty care (i.e., trauma and endemic disease medical countermeasures). Thus, it is highly desired for CBR diagnostic capabilities to leverage routine, non-CBR health care capabilities such as clinical chemistry tests, endemic infectious disease tests, traumatic brain injury screening, and specific or non-specific insult/injury host-response.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) currently operates multiplex-PCR diagnostics in the controlled laboratory environment mentioned above and expects to deploy additional PCR-based, CBR diagnostic capabilities closer to the combat frontline by 2022. Any new capabilities must complement the existing diagnostics family of systems to improve patient health outcomes and force health decisions.</p>
<p>Requirements: <br />The purpose of this RFI is to solicit information on the availability or developmental status of affinity-based systems, or other alternatives to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based systems, for diagnosis of intoxication or infection with CBR warfare agents. Responses will inform market research for the advanced development, procurement, fielding, and sustainment of a reusable, lightweight, low-complexity, in vitro diagnostic (IVD) capability.</p>
<p>1. MCS-DX is interested in a reusable, multiplex diagnostic platform with application to CBR threats including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>a. Intracellular bacterial pathogen infection: Brucellosis (Brucella spp.), epidemic typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii), Q Fever (Coxiella burnetii), Melioidosis (Burkholderia spp.), and syndromic near-neighbors for which a differential diagnostic impacts clinical treatment course<br />b. Viruses: Encephalitic alphaviruses (Eastern, Western, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus) <br />c. Biological toxins: botulism (botulinum toxin), ricin, food poisoning (staphylococcal enterotoxin B; SEB), Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis)<br />d. Non-specific viral vs. bacterial screening<br />e. External gamma radiation exposure testing (&gt;6 Gy) and triage screening (&gt;2 Gy)</p>
<p>2. Diagnostic Targets: Agent-derived or host-response biomarkers are acceptable for each disease.</p>
<p>3. Clinical Sample Types: Non-invasive or minimally invasive sample types consistent with collection and analyses in austere environments (e.g., capillary whole blood, venous whole blood, saliva, urine, sputum, stool, exudates, etc.).</p>
<p>4. Data and Communications: HIPAA-compliant communications and data processing tools supporting remote data analysis/interpretation of point-of-care sample analyses, if applicable, should be described.</p>
<p>5. Time to Result: Rapid sample-to-answer protocol is highly desired - if greater than 120 minutes, please explain why this is the state of the art for the threat/application. Rapid protocols support administration of appropriate clinical treatment at earlier points in disease progression.</p>
<p>6. Ease-of-Use: Moderate complexity to CLIA-waived - if highly complex please explain why this is the state of the art for the threat/application.</p>
<p>7. Product Maturity: FDA-cleared IVD or sufficiently mature to begin clinical trials no later than 2023.</p>
<p>8. Other Considerations: Safety features for use with BSL 4 agents, including limited user exposure to contaminated sample and minimized risk of aerosolizing sample materials, are desirable. Additionally, support of 3rd-party components through open architecture assay or device design, as well as non-proprietary file formats, is advantageous for integration across Services and should be described.</p>
<p>Performance Objectives: <br />In fewer than 10 pages (single-sided; not including cover page and cover letter), respondents are encouraged to address the above desired characteristics and the below informative details:<br />&bull; Total system weight and dimensions - inclusive of instrumentation and consumables <br />&bull; Ability to process multiple clinical sample matrices relevant to disease status<br />&bull; Assay methodology (e.g. sample preparation, performance steps, detection and analysis methods)<br />&bull; Applicability of system to other morbidities of military relevance (e.g. traumatic brain injury, infectious disease, or cardiac care)<br />&bull; Other commercial assays (in development or currently available), on the described system, that address a DoD routine healthcare capability<br />&bull; Relevant efforts in the discovery pipeline (e.g. antibody, antigen, or biomarker identification efforts)<br />&bull; Synopsis of any relevant experience with the regulatory approval process, including providing capabilities under Emergency Use Authorization<br />&bull; Description of IVD applications under development with the proposed system <br />&bull; Existing or emerging FDA regulatory framework to support development and 510(k) clearance/PMA approval<br />&bull; Assay storage requirements - study-demonstrated (e.g. room temperature, refrigerated, frozen) <br />&bull; Shelf-life extent - supported by current Good Manufacturing Practices stability studies.<br />&bull; Manufacturing capabilities - system or kit production rates; COTS or outsourced component availability <br />&bull; Estimated cost per test - clearly explain plexity (per sample, per target, per run, etc.)<br />&bull; Alignment with planned technology transitions between academia, industry, government<br />&bull; Associated intellectual property rights or patent coverage <br />&bull; Willingness to enter into agreements with the DoD utilizing the medical countermeasures Other Transaction Authority (OTA) via membership in the MCDC (www.medcbrn.org)</p>
<p>Administration: The Government will retain comments and information received in response to this RFI. Proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government security classification markings. All written responses must be received by 4:00 pm on 26 April 2018. Responses should be sent by e-mail to: usarmy ft detrick dod jpeocbd mailbox mcs-rfi@mail.mil, with Subject Line of Responding Organization Name and RFI Title. Material that is advertisement only in nature is not desired. If a solicitation is subsequently released based on the responses to this RFI the first choice for an acquisition vehicle, if appropriate, will be the Medical CBRN Defense Consortium (MCDC) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA). Respondents not already members of the consortium are encouraged to join at www.medcbrn.org. Respondents may also inquire about the MCDC at mcdc@ati.org.</p>

<p>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) is seeking sources to provide continued research and development efforts for Naval Health Research Center's (NHRC's) NOR-211 clinical trial, in support of NHRC, 140 Sylvester Road, San Diego, CA 92152.</p>
<p>These services are currently being provided under a non-severable contract/task order W911QY-11-D-0053/0015, awarded to the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine (HJF). Due to unforeseen delays in the project, primarily due to Government IRB approvals and the recent absence of Norovirus outbreaks in U.S. Navy recruits entering basic training at Naval Station Great Lakes, additional time and effort is required to complete the NOR-211 clinical trial. It is estimated that an additional six-months of services provided by HJF will result in successful completion of the clinical trial thus resulting in a benefit to the Government for the services provided.</p>
<p>The IRB-reviewed and approved clinical vaccine trail protocol designated NOR-211 is a Phase IIb, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Double-blind, Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Intramuscular Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 Bivalent Virus-Like Particle Vaccine in Healthy Adults. The modification to the existing non-severable services contract/task order will extend the period of performance by six months, from 30 April 2018 to 30 October 2018, with an estimated increase of $1.3M, in order to gain and compile research data to successfully complete the clinical trial.</p>
<p>The purpose of the NOR-211 study is to demonstrate the efficacy and expand data on the safety and immunogenicity profile of this new, investigational Norovirus (NoV) vaccine, evaluate the immune response to the NoV vaccine when given with other vaccines, as well as the potential effects the NoV vaccine has on the immune response to the other vaccines received at the same time and vice/versa. The NOR-211 study will help prepare for a future Phase III study where the vaccine will be used to assess whether it can prevent NoV illness in U.S. Navy Recruit Training settings. Study subjects include consenting voluntary Navy recruits entering basic training at Naval Station Great Lakes, IL.</p>
<p>Based on the progression of the research thus far, the proposed modification to increase performance for six months will allow for research efforts to include additional study participants in order to carry out the study protocols to successfully evaluate the immune response to the NoV vaccine when given with other vaccines, the potential effects the NoV vaccine on the immune response, and to the other vaccines received at the same time. Without the additional work and extended period of performance, an adequate study sample cannot be achieved. In addition, as a result of the lack of norovirus cases, an increased number of research subjects were enrolled in the study later than anticipated, requiring additional time to complete patient safety follow-ups, in compliance with FDA study regulations. Without the additional time and effort, patient safety follow-ups would not be completed. In addition, without the additional time and effort, it would not be possible to provide patient safety follow-ups for the most recent/to be enrolled subjects, gather the data, and prepare it for evaluation.</p>
<p>The contractor will continue to provide research support for the NOR-211 clinical trial. In coordination with the NHRC Principal Investigator, the contractor will continue to carry out the NOR-211 clinical study in accordance with the IRB-approved protocol. The contractor will provide personnel with the research expertise and familiarity with this ongoing clinical trial. The personnel will provide the overall day-to-day management and conduct of the NOR-211 protocol elements to ensure successful completion of the objectives and outcomes set forth in the protocol, ensuring adherence to quality standards and good clinical practices. Aspects of service consist of, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>&bull; assist with coordinating assigned research studies in accordance with approved protocol and applicable local and state and federal regulations while promoting the safety and confidentiality of research subjects and their data at all times,<br />&bull; meet with potential research subjects; explain the research project in detail and determine if subject meets study eligibility based on the protocol's delineated inclusion and exclusion criteria,<br />&bull; enroll eligible subjects into the study by obtaining a fully completed signed/written informed consent document,<br />&bull; perform blood draw processing and blood and serum processing according to federal and state regulations,<br />&bull; administer all study-related vaccinations using good clinical practices,<br />&bull; complete all appropriate study-related document(s) to ensure correct vaccines (investigational vaccine or placebo) were administered to each study subject,<br />&bull; conduct and document investigational vaccine and placebo inventories, <br />&bull; ensure study materials and equipment are available to perform daily study functions,<br />&bull; maintain complete and accurate drug and equipment accountability,<br />&bull; ensure analysis and recorded test data reports form a consistent narrative, <br />&bull; provide administrative support for the management of generated research data as necessary,<br />&bull; ensure proper closure of each research subject,<br />&bull; coordinate shipping of specimens from study sites, and<br />&bull; ensure all regulatory and protocol requirements are met, including patient-safety follow-ups.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the entire task order, inclusive of performance during this six month extension, is expected to be 2 Dec 2015 to 30 October 2018.</p>
<p>If capable sources are not identified through this notice, NMLC intends to award a sole source modification under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine (HJF), 6720-A Rockledge Drive, Suite 100, Bethesda, MD 20817.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 1 (8.5 x 11 inch) page using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 4:00 PM, Eastern Time, 21 March 2018. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: cheryl.r.vendemia.civ@mail.mil AND thomas.l.hood26.civ@mail.mil.</p>

Although the primary user of the list will be the Forest Service, any USDA office located in the Forest Service Eastern Region boundaries may use the list. <br /><br />The shortlist will contain all of the unexpired submissions from previous announcements and all qualified, interested AE firms that respond to this announcement. <br /><br />Examples of the types of work that may be awarded using the short selection list include: bridge and large culvert design, road and trail bridge inspections, culvert inspections, low volume road design, design of small warehouses and offices, historic preservation, rehabs to improve energy efficiency and safety concerns, energy audits and studies, design of repairs to small dams and impoundments, design of photovoltaic and other renewable energy systems, LEED consulting, design of HVAC systems, design of electrical systems and lighting, water and waste water system design, performance of sanitary inspections for water systems, safety inspections for bridges and dams, construction inspection, drafting services, surveying (construction and property), geotechnical investigation, and environmental (RCRA, CECRLA, CWA, etc.) investigations, reviews, inventories, audits and coordination of RCRA and other waste disposal.

Discussions are then held with the 3 firms to determine the best qualified firm for that particular project. A price proposal will be requested from the highest technically rated firm. If a reasonable price cannot be negotiated, discussions will be held with the second best qualified firm, and so on. AE data files will be maintained by State and NAICS code. The AE's professional qualifications for satisfactory performance of the required services (FAR 36.602-1(a)(1) and the firm's geographic proximity and knowledge of the local area (FAR 36.602-1(a)(5)) as identified on the AE's SF330 and supplemental information, will be used for the first preliminary screening of firms when a large list of potential firms exist.<br /><br />All acquisitions utilizing the short selection&nbsp;list shall be set-aside for small business concerns unless requirements cannot be met by a small business and the Contracting Officer obtains a proper waiver.<br /><br />WHAT DOES MY FIRM NEED TO SUBMIT TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY AND RECEIVE CONSIDERATION FOR FUTURE AE PROJECTS?<br />All information shall be submitted on a CD/DVD capable of being read utilizing Windows 7 and 10 operating systems.

<DESC><br />1.	SUMMARY<br /><br />The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is seeking information under this Request for Information (RFI) to assess commercial interest in development of domestic lunar lander capabilities that would evolve to meeting the identified performance towards human-class landers. These progressively larger lander capabilities are complementary to NASA's new Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) effort to award contracts to provide capabilities as soon as 2019.<br /> <br />NASA has multiple new and linked activities proposed under the President's Budget Request for 2019 that mandates a robust return to the Moon.  These efforts will establish U.S. leadership for missions to, around, and on the Moon.  NASA is planning to develop a series of increasingly complex and capable lunar missions to the surface of the Moon, starting first with robotic missions. This new initiative will be undertaken in coordination with scientific lunar exploration, and will run in parallel to the development and flight of the Space Launch Systems (SLS), Orion, and the elements of the Lunar Orbital Platform - Gateway.  This will be a collaborative effort between NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD), Science Mission Directorate (SMD), and Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD).<br /><br />NASA has been fostering the growth of commercial lunar lander capabilities through the Lunar CATALYST public private partnership efforts.  Under these competitively-awarded agreements NASA has provided assistance to private entities through the application of NASA Subject Matter Expertise (SME), unique facilities, software, and the loan of government equipment.  NASA is now beginning conceptual development of a human class lander. NASA envisions using a series of medium-to-large landers with payloads in the 500-5000 kg range to assist in requirements development and establish an approach to a human-class lander in the next decade.<br /><br />Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) are sought broadly from U.S. industry, universities, non-profit organizations, and other U.S. government agencies, and these will be used by NASA to inform planning and acquisition strategy development.<br /><br />2.	BACKGROUND<br /><br />The President's Space Policy Directive-1 instructs NASA to "Lead an innovative and sustainable program of exploration with commercial and international partners to enable human expansion across the solar system and to bring back to Earth new knowledge and opportunities." NASA is trying to better determine the state-of-art and maturity of lander capability in the private sector and mature its own requirements for a human-class lander.  NASA has therefore identified a variety of exploration, science, and technology demonstration objectives that can be addressed by sending instruments, experiments, or other payloads to the lunar surface. <br /> <br />These progressively larger lander capabilities are complementary to NASA's new Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) effort to award contracts to provide capabilities as soon as 2019.  The early missions under CLPS will support innovative approaches to achieve human and robotic science/exploration goals by funding contracts for commercial transportation services. CLPS will also support delivery of small rovers and instruments to meet lunar science and exploration needs. NASA plans to release a Request for Proposals for CLPS in mid-2018 that is expected to fund payload opportunities on near-term commercial lunar landing opportunities. <br /><br />To enable the development of robust lander capabilities and better understand technical requirements leading to eventual human-scale capabilities, NASA is seeking information from U.S. entities on how to approach capabilities development, including requirements, with the near-term goal of a first mission to the lunar surface as early as Fiscal Year 2022.  NASA anticipates that the initial capability of this evolutionary path is for landers capable of landing around 500kg of payload mass to the lunar surface.  Such landers could support initial commercial and government activities covering lunar science, technology and human exploration objectives.  These medium-scale landers (500kg payload) will also provide critical risk reduction and technology requirements maturation for a human-scale lander descent stage (5,000-6,000 kg payload) as well as utilization capabilities.
<p><br />To accomplish these goals, NASA is assuming an initial set of two demonstration landers will be funded over the next 4-7 years, with the capability to deliver payloads starting in the ~500 kg range. These landings will be in addition to the numerous small landing missions to be planned and conducted under the CLPS contract. These demonstration missions could also prove out key requirements such as landing precision, long-term survivability, guidance, and navigation for human ascent vehicles.</p>
<p>NASA has a goal to complete an initial demonstration of these human-class lander capabilities by the end of the 2020s. NASA is seeking inputs through this RFI on the potential technical steps, partnership approach, cost implications, and strategy required to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>3.	RESPONSE GUIDELINES<br /><br />Since this is a request for information, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI by answering the following questions to be submitted electronically, via e-mail, to the primary Point of Contact (POC) listed below. The Response text, exclusive of the one-page summary described below, shall not exceed 30 pages (including attachments), and shall use a minimum font size of 12.<br /> <br />A.	Your Response should include:<br /><br />1.	Entity information: name, contact information, summary of previous relevant experience, indicate whether a U.S. entity, identify partners and funding sources/investors.<br /><br />2.	Details of how you would approach development of a lander capable of delivering 500-5000 kg payloads with an emphasis on building towards a human-scale lander, including how NASA-provided resources (other than funds) can assist in the development of your lander capabilities, and your schedule for potential lunar mission(s). <br /><br />3.	If you have lander concepts, include these, for example, picture/image, description (mass, volume, operations concept, maturity, etc.)<br /><br />B.	Your Response should include answers to the following topics and questions:<br /><br />B.1. Partnership:<br /><br />1.	Industry collaboration and public-private partnerships, through cost-sharing or in-kind cost or technical contributions, is highly desirable. How would the financial, technical, and risk factors associated with lander development be shared between the government and private sector?  <br /><br />2.	What type of legal mechanism(s), such as contracts (fixed price, cost-plus, cost-share), Space Act Agreements (collaborative, funded), or Cooperative Agreements should NASA use to partner with industry to develop a medium-to-large lander capability, and why?<br /><br />3.	What potential NASA requirements would hinder your business case?  What changes could NASA make to existing requirements that would further your business case?<br /><br />4.	What is your estimate of the market today (in number of launches per year or dollars) for medium to large lander capabilities in addition to NASA payloads? What is your estimate of future market potential (in number of launches per year or dollars) for medium to large lander capabilities in addition to NASA's payloads? Is there a self-sustainable market without NASA as a potential user? What mission cadence would be needed to support your capability?<br /><br />5.	What approach should be taken toward Intellectual Property (IP) inventions and data rights? What IP challenges do you foresee? How can these be addressed? What types of corporate and government contributions should merit invention ownership, and the provision of unlimited or unrestricted data rights by the Government, and what types of contributions should result in the ability of partners to assert limited or restricted rights in data?</p>
<p>B.2. Technical:<br /><br />1.	What is a reasonable development timeline? Is a first flight demonstration of a 500 kg class lander achievable by Fiscal Year 2022? If not, what is an achievable timeframe? <br /><br />2.	What NASA capabilities will assist you in developing lander capabilities: integration and test facilities, technical expertise, government furnished equipment, etc.?<br /><br />3.	What are the critical technologies that need to be developed and what are their current maturities?<br /><br />4.	What lander technical/development challenges need to be addressed that would enable a first flight demonstration in Fiscal Year 2022 with a 500 kg payload?  <br /><br />5.	Is a 500 kg payload-class lander evolvable to a human-scale lander? What evolutionary path(s) are most feasible for developing a human-scale lander capability?<br /><br />6.	Should NASA require evolvability to a lander capable of landing crew on the surface at this early stage? <br /><br />7.	What launch vehicles are suitable for lunar lander missions?  What is the preferred method for procuring the launch vehicle and why? <br /><br />8.	Are the current human rating requirements adequate for lander development? Or would you recommend changes to the approach to human rating and why? <br /><br />B.3. Cost:<br /><br />1.	What is the total cost of the initial capability development and flight demonstration of a 500-kg-payload lander to the lunar surface by Fiscal Year 2022? What is the total expected cost to extend the capability to a human-scale lander and flight demonstration (i.e., 5,000-6,000 kg payload)?<br /><br />2.	What would be NASA's expected share of the initial capability development and first flight demonstration in 2022? And how would that extend to the human-scale lander development?<br /><br />3.	How would changing the timing of flight dates (i.e., 2023 or 2024) for a first flight demonstration effect the cost? <br /><br />C.	Summary<br /><br />To facilitate a prompt review, a one-page summary shall be included with your Response which shall outline your company's specific capabilities that are relevant (and reflect the magnitude) to these requirements.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt;"><a name="_Hlk500160839">First responders typically survey high-risk facilities in their jurisdiction at least once per year as part of a preplanning process. Outputs from preplanning are often in report form, and first responders may annotate available floor plans (e.g. from CAD models) or generate their own hand-drawn maps during the process. Preplanning is time-consuming, inefficient, and inherently complex considering the information and level of detail that should or could be captured, the lack of automation, and difficulty identifying notable changes to facilities and infrastructure during successive preplanning surveys. </a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt;">PSCR has identified mobile 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) as a potentially transformational technology for first responders. Using LiDAR and 360 degree cameras imagery, coupled with advanced software processing, first responders could very efficiently capture 3D point clouds and a wealth of other information, both observed and derived, while walking through buildings as part of their routine preplanning operations. The use of 3D LiDAR and imagery has many potential upsides beyond just creating point clouds for visualization and mapping, e.g., use in localization, object classification, integration with virtual/augmented reality solutions, change detection, etc. Though not widely used currently for surveying, especially outside the architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) community, it is expected that investments by the automotive and unmanned aerial systems industries will drive the costs of 3D LiDAR down dramatically over the next five years so that it will become a cost-effective tool for public safety, building owners/managers, and various service industries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt;">To accelerate research and development for this public safety driven use-case, the contractors shall develop and demonstrate the following prototyping and demonstration activities:</p>

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>Background: </strong>The National Institute on Drug Abuse Intramural Research Program (NIDA IRP) has established a collaborative relationship with the Johns Hopkins University Department of Neuroscience (JHU).  The purpose of this collaboration is to allow the research experience and expertise of NIDA IRP Investigators to be imparted to students currently enrolled and studying in the Johns Hopkins Department of Neuroscience.  First year JHU graduate students will be working on a rotational basis in the NIDA IRP laboratories. Johns Hopkins University program management and liaison services are required to ensure that these rotations are effectively arranged and that student oversight is provided.<br />Purpose and Objectives: The NIDA IRP requires Johns Hopkins University program management and liaison services in support of a collaborative graduate student rotational program between the NIDA IRP and JHU.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: </strong><br />Independently, and not as an agent of the government, the contractor shall:</p>
<p>&bull;	Liaise between the NIDA IRP and JHU students to schedule graduate student rotations<br />&bull;	Enter graduate student rotational program data into JHU systems to ensure students receive course credit. This involves accessing personally identifiable student information held by JHU.<br />&bull;	Prepare rotational program documentation for Johns Hopkins graduate students as well as documentation for any required clearances, Johns Hopkins Health Care system and liability insurance etc.<br />&bull;	Provide oversight of Johns Hopkins graduate students working in the NIDA IRP. <br />&bull;	Provide monthly and annual reports to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) regarding the graduate student rotational program.</p>
<p><br /><strong>ESTIMATED  EFFORT:</strong><br />It is estimated that the effort required for full performance would be one (1) part-time individual (1,040 hours per year).</p>

<p><strong>Background: </strong>The National Institute on Drug Abuse studies the biological effects of newly-emerging drugs of abuse. One of our techniques is to measure blood pressure, temperature, and locomotor activity in rodents.  Abused drugs can have stimulatory cardiovascular effects that can lead to serious medical complications. These transponders are necessary to measure the effects of our novel D3 antagonist versus partial agonist on blood pressure, temperature, and locomotor activity in the absence and presence of either cocaine or oxycodone.  These studies are needed for investigational new drug approval of our novel compounds.<br />Purpose and Objectives: The NIDA IRP needs eight pressure, temperature and activity transponders that will be used to measure blood pressure, temperature, and locomotor activity in rats. Blood pressure, temperature, and locomotor activity will be measured in these animals to look at the effects of our novel D3 antagonist versus partial agonist in the absence and presence of either cocaine or oxycodone. These studies are needed for these drugs to be approved as investigational new drugs.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements: </strong>The Pressure, Temperature, &amp; Locomotor Activity Implanted Telemetry Devices must have the following salient characteristics:</p>
<p>The implantable pressure, temperature, and activity transponders must allow researchers to continuously collect multiple physiologic parameters from rats.  Endpoints that must be able to be measured with the transponders are pressure, temperature, and activity. The transponders must have data security to ensure that the data collected is from the intended animal.  The system must auto-calibrate to reduce setup time and eliminate human error during manual entry.  The transponder must have at least a five month battery life, and the researcher must also be able to see the battery life in real time for planning purposes and for reuse of the transponder.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated delivery date:</strong> 30 days from date of award.</p>
<p><strong>Other important considerations: </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The&nbsp;implantable telemetry devices must be compatible with Data Sciences International Model RPC-1 receivers and DataQuest A.R.T Gold v4.36 software.</span></p>

<DESC>Market research is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements for qualification and production of a "Convenient &amp; Precise Tissue Clamp"
<p>Background Information</p>
<p>During vitreoretinal surgery multiple instruments are introduced through scleral openings (sclerotomies) in the wall of the eye through which vitreous humor and other fluids can leak.  Loss of intraocular fluids can lead to surgical complications, such as collapse of the eye, retinal bleeding, and detachment of the retina.  Some intra-ocular procedures, such as retinal transplantation or implantation with in vitro retinal tissue, may require making unusually large incisions in that eye that must be repeatedly opened and closed while minimizing disruption of the pressure equilibrium within the eye.  Fluid-tight scleral incisions would avoid excessive or continuous fluid loss that necessitates constant infusion of replacement fluid into the eye.</p>
<p>There is a need for a convenient &amp; precise tissue clamp that can be easily manually manipulated to selectively open and close surgical incisions and traumatic wounds, such as penetrating injuries that must be quickly closed to achieve hemostasis and protect the wound until surgical repair can be completed.</p>
<p>The surgical tissue clamp prototype has been designed (patent pending) and used in animal surgeries with convenience and excellent results. The clamp has been used during implantation into the retina of a scaffold on which choroid and retinal pigment epithelium cells and retina grow in a three-dimensional matrix that mimics the native structure of the retina.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives of this Source Sought</p>
<p>Specific objectives of this requirement:</p>
<p>&bull;	Help determine best materials to use for manufacturing of this clamp. Preferred selection of materials should be based on previously tested clinically approved materials that are currently used in manufacturing of surgical instruments</p>
<p>&bull;	Create engineering drawing based on current prototype. Drawings should include details needed for production of multiple clamps in a consistent mater</p>
<p>&bull;	Several manufactured clamps will be used to test their performance during surgeries. Based on surgeon's experience incorporate all needed changes and re-test updated clamp design. Repeat this cycle if needed.</p>
<p>&bull;	Finalize engineering drawings including materials</p>
<p>&bull;	Produce batch of clamps. Final amount will be determined later (~20).</p>
<p><br />Contractor will help finalize surgical clamp design where previous knowledge of surgical instruments design and biocompatible materials selection will be utilized in consultation with surgeons to produce small batch of surgical clamps for use in eye surgeries for temporary closure of surgical wound.</p>
<p>Final design and drawings are required by May 30, 2018<br />Small batch of clamps - by June 15, 2018</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>Contractor is required to have previous knowledge in manufacturing ocular or related surgery instruments. Good knowledge of biocompatible materials, capability to produce professional drawings, and manufacturing capabilities are required.</p>
<p>Contractor is required to help in finalizing clamp design, choosing materials, producing drawings, and manufacturing final version of clamp.</p>
<p>Optional, any contractor which can provide cleaning (reducing bioburden) and packaging option for this clamp that insures clamp integrity during sterilization, transportation, and storage of this clamp will be given extra consideration.</p>
<p>This project latest completion date June 30, 2018</p>
<p><br />Government Responsibilities</p>
<p>Clamp prototype, photographs (including in use photographs) and sketches will be provided to initiate this work. We will provide facility for testing intermediate and final version of clamp.</p>
<p><br />Reporting Requirements and Deliverables</p>
<p>Contractor is required timely communication of progress and cost with updates at least once a week.</p>
<p>Deliverables will include finalized engineering drawings with well-defined materials and batch of manufactured clamps. <br /> <br />Program Management and Control Requirements</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements</p>
<p>Surgeries based on swine model will be used to determine clamp functionality and satisfactory design using following criteria: ease of handling, ease of application and removal of clamp during surgery, Ability of clamp completely close scleral wound.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (EXWC) has a requirement to procure Multi-Mission Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Response Trucks (MERTs).   The MERT has two primary compartments; the front vehicle operator’s compartment and the rear EOD technician compartment.   The rear EOD technician compartment shall be divided into two sub-compartments; EOD personnel work area and robot storage/garage area.

Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Shore Detachments that are based within the Continental United States (CONUS) require a specialized vehicle to support their mission.  CONUS based EOD units support both the Department of Defense (DoD) in CONUS, and local, state, and federal authorities as required.
  The MERT will be a highly mobile, wheeled vehicle platform with a full suite of mission equipment, communication gear, and electronics capabilities specifically designed for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), explosive hazards, and EOD operations. In addition, the MERT must be reconfigurable.  Reconfiguration capability should include integrating additional components such as communications equipment; external Chemical, Biological, Nuclear, and Radiological (CBNRE) detectors; external camera and sensors; etc., as noted in ‘Attachment A.’  To accomplish this reconfiguration capability, the vehicle must be able to provide optimum flexibility in both internal and external configuration to the MERT.
  The vehicles must be able to integrate specialty items specified in the requirements.  There is an additional requirement for wiring trunks/conduit and channeling for future expansion of capability.  Interested vendors need to consider maximizing Commercial off-the shelf (COTS) components when balanced against other requirements within this RFI.

‘Attachment A’ provides an overview of specifications for a project the Government is considering. Inclusion of ‘Attachment A’ with this RFI is intended to provide prospective contractors with a rough scope of potential work; the actual details within the work scope may be different if released for solicitation.
All interested parties are invited to submit responses (using the ‘Attachment B’ as a template on the attached Statement of Interest or as part of your submittal) describing their ability to perform the work requirements or describing any products with similar capabilities.
  
‘Attachment B’ includes space for the parties to describe their experience, qualifications, past performance, company information, business size and status as it relates to the NAICS code provided, and any other relevant information.  Also,  ‘Attachment B’ includes space for indicating if any interested party has been US Government accredited for any of the following: Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone Small Business (HUBZoneSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and if applicable, Historically Black Colleges or Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI).
  This  in performance of a potential contract including solo effort, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.

Submissions should be five megabytes or less and in a format compatible with Microsoft Office.

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. EXWC is conducting market research to determine the range of available contractors and assess their capabilities to perform the work requirements described. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes – it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.

Respondees are advised that the U.S.
 Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party’s expense. The Government will treat all information received in response to this notice as proprietary and such information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations. Responses to this sources sought request for information will not be returned.
An award will not be made on any information or offers received in response to this notice. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.

It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor that site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

<DESC>This RFI is issued for market research purposes only. The purpose of this notice is twofold:<br /><br />1.	Identify U.S. small business concerns having an interest in and capability to provide support for INL/WHP programs. Responses to this notice will be considered in selecting the acquisition strategy and to determine the appropriateness of setting aside Functional Areas (FAs) of the IDIQ for any one of the small business programs described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19.<br /><br />2.	Obtain industry feedback on the proposed acquisition strategy to include, but not limited to: IDIQ contract ceiling, composition of FAs, proposed number of awards per FA, and existing contract vehicles that the Department may leverage to meet INL/WHP requirements.<br /><br />All information contained in this notice is preliminary in nature and is subject to change. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Request for Quotations (RFQ), Invitation for Bids (IFB), or a commitment on the part of the government to conduct a solicitation in the future. All information provided is strictly voluntary and no reimbursement will be made by the Government for any costs associated with providing a response to this notice or otherwise participating in market research activities. Further, the US Department of State offers no assurance that a solicitation will result from this notice.<br /><br />Any information submitted will become the property of the Government and will not be returned. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and must be clearly marked.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></strong>
<p>The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) leads the Department of State's anticrime and counter-narcotics efforts. INL assistance programs help partner nations to build their capacities to extend the reach of justice under the rule of law, including respect for human rights and gender equality, and to deny safe haven to criminals who would otherwise operate with near impunity.<br /><br />INL delivers technical assistance and capacity to: enhance international drug control through interdiction and supply reduction; develop civilian law enforcement capacity, regional partnerships, and information sharing; and further the administration of justice and corrections under the rule of law with respect for human rights. INL's programs seek to oppose and counter illicit drug production and demand; drug, wildlife and human trafficking; corruption; cybercrime; intellectual property rights (IPR) fraud; transnational organized crime; environmental crime; crimes that threaten civilian security; crimes against women; and activities using the proceeds of crime.</p>
<p><br />INL's anticrime programs seek to improve and support key components of the criminal justice system such as gendarmerie, police, customs and border officials, investigators, judges, courts, prosecutors, defense attorneys, civil society organizations, and the corrections system. INL also plays a significant role in front line U.S. foreign policy priority countries in transition by assisting in strengthening internal security and governance under the rule of law.</p>
<p><br />The nimble, fluid nature of international crime needs to be addressed through a variety of tools, both programmatic and diplomatic. Criminal networks are constantly evolving and changing their activities in response to operational threats. New competitors enter the crime market with different ideas and ways of operating as others are arrested, neutralized, or removed. As the law enforcement communities' anti-crime techniques improve, criminals evolve their techniques to make use of new technologies and alter and expand their modes of criminality, especially in the commission of cybercrime, financial crime, and the smuggling of drugs, weapons and humans. Often, a lack of sufficient and appropriate resources, combined with host governments' limited infrastructure and capacity to support and maintain the newest technological advancements and equipment, severely hinder the ability to immediately and effectively counter criminal networks.</p>
<p><br />The threats and challenges INL faces are often regional, and therefore, the solutions should be regional. Many of the challenges and criminal networks faced by INL and its partners in the Western Hemisphere are interrelated and similar in nature. Additionally, many INL partners in the region share a common language, possess a similar culture, and face similar constraints in meeting the aforementioned challenges. Moreover, historically there has been a high degree of cooperation between INL programs in the region.</p>
<p><br />In order to meet its objectives, INL/WHP requires flexible and timely acquisition support. This proposed multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract aims to establish a streamlined approach to successfully meeting INL/WHP's acquisition requirements, while maintaining the public's trust and fulfilling public policy objectives.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROPOSED CONTRACT STRUCTURE</span></strong></p>
<p><br />The Department aims to establish approximately three (3) IDIQ contracts per each of the following FAs. The cumulative program ceiling is expected to be approximately $500 million for the 66-month effective period of the contracts (5-year base plus a 6-month option).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull;	FA 1: Training Services<br />&bull;	FA 2: IT Services<br />&bull;	FA 3: IT and Communications Systems<br />&bull;	FA 4: Operations, Logistics, and Facilities Support Services<br />&bull;	FA 5: Forensics and Non-Intrusive Inspection Equipment<br />&bull;	FA 6: Vehicles<br />&bull;	FA 7: Watercraft<br /><br />The FAs were selected to comply with the requirements of 13 CFR &sect;121.402(c). While we acknowledge certain overlap between the FAs, each order awarded under the IDIQ contracts will be assigned the single NAICS code that best describes the principal purpose of the goods or services to be acquired. This NAICS code selection will determine under which FA the order will be awarded. Only companies awarded an IDIQ contract under that FA will be eligible for award. Companies may participate and be awarded contracts under more than one FA.</p>
<p><br />Refer to Appendix A for a list of proposed FAs, associated NAICS codes, small business size standards, and examples of task required under each FA.</p>
<p><br />Companies may be required to provide services in the language of the INL partner nation. Additionally, all products may require local warranty, maintenance, and support. The use of simultaneous translators and/or US-based warranty and technical services may not meet INL/WHP requirements.</p>
<p><br />While we acknowledge there are multiple companies with generic capabilities under each FA, we are particularly interested in companies having said capabilities <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span></strong> implementation experience in programs similar to INL/WHP programs.<br /><br />Work under the IDIQs will require performance overseas. Additionally, performance may be required in remote and non-permissive locations. USG logistical and other support will be kept to a minimum.<br /><br />Given the nature of the required work, the Department reserves the right to require offerors to possess a facility security clearance and its personnel to possess a security clearance (American Citizen and Third Country Nationals) or a Regional Security Office (RSO) background investigation (Local Nationals).<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NON-MANUFACTURER RULE (NMR)<br /></span></strong><br />For those FAs for which a manufacturing NAICS code has been assigned small business are reminded that, unless the SBA has granted a class waiver of the NMR for the particular product, the company will be required to be either the manufacturer of the products offered or qualify for the procurement as a "nonmanufacturer".</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 19.102(f), the applicable size standard for a "nonmanufacturer" is 500 employees.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSE</span></strong></p>
<p><br />Prospective offerors interested in responding to this notice should submit information electronically to Weakley-LugoKF@state.gov and FernandezJM@state.gov no later than April 4, 2018 at 10:00 am EST.</p>
<p><br />The Government will only consider responses submitted in the Appendix B format. Given the interest expected, the required format is required to facilitate with the efficient analysis of responses. Responses providing partial information may not be considered by the Government.</p>
<p><br />Telephone inquiries will not be accepted nor acknowledged. Questions, if any, must be directed via email to Weakley-LugoKF@state.gov and FernandezJM@state.gov.</p>
<p><br />Individual feedback or evaluations will be not be provided to companies regarding their submissions.</p>
<p><br />The Government reverses the right to conduct one-on-one interviews with any of the respondents to this notice. Depending on the number of responses received one-on-one interviews may not be conducted with each respondent.</p>
