EQUIPMENT LIST AND SPECIFICATIONS: 
CHAMELEON SYSTEM: VISION II: INTEGRATED PRECOMPENSATION: 80 MHz: (RoHS) LASER SYSTEM
1 EACH


Source specifications for a solid state ultrafast laser to be used as an excitation source in a Leica multiphoton microscopy system 


.  

Architecture
The laser system shall be comprised of a solid-state single-frequency green pump laser, a sealed Titanium:Sapphire (Ti:S) Kerr lens modelocked oscillator an actively controlled interface between these components, a solid state chiller, an advanced cavity filtration protection and a dual manual and computer interface to allow for experimental integration.  Sytsem is to include a fully variable precompensation system,integrated with laser system. We have found that the Chameleon Vision II laser system from Coherent is the only laser which meets our desired system specifications, interfaces directly with the Leica microscope and offers the performance characteristics that will support the intended research.

Performance Specifications
"	EXCLUSIVE- Output average power specification required is > 3.0W at peak of Ti:S curve, with a tuning range of 680 nm to 1080 nm.  Capabilities are required across this entire tuning range to cover our current and future experiments. Capability for rapid wavelength changes, 40nm/sec. 
Required power:  ( minimum)
500mW @ 680 nm
1.5W @ 710 nm
3.0W @800 nm
400mW 1040 nm
180 mW 1080 nm
"	EXCLUSIVE- Minimum tuning range required is 680 nm - 1080 nm inclusive without operator adjustments other than request of wavelength. System to tune through atmospheric absorption bands > 900 nm without requirement of external gas purge.
"	EXCLUSIVE- Integrated dispersion compensation module.  The system must include a dispersion compensation module to pre-chirp, or cancel chirp induced by optical components in the microscope and optical set up.  This module must be automated and able to tune to 0 fs^2 at all wavelengths.  This module must be able to compensate up to 47,000 fs^2 at 680 nm. 
"	EXCLUSIVE- Pulse width near >140 fs at the sample. 
"	System shall have the lowest noise specifications to provide optimal images.  A noise spec of 0.15%, or less, is required. 
"	EXCLUSIVE- Hermetically-sealed construction with optical cavity protection.  Diode pumped laser systems generally degrade due to optical contamination from dust and solvents present in the lab. It is required that the system be hermetically sealed to provide long life and minimal downtime System must include a closed-loop air filtration and recirculation unit to ensure that the cavity is free from out-gassing components (carbon trap filtration), micro-dust particles (HEPA filter), and water vapor (dryer cartridge)
"	EXCLUSIVE- User-replaceable pump diodes.  Because pump diodes are the single greatest maintenance cost, diodes must be user replaceable and be able to be changed without the involvement of the laser head, or disturbance of any kind to the experimental set up.
"	 EXCLUSIVE- Low noise.  Amplitude noise of the system is critical in many of small signal applications. Thus the Ti:S must be pumped by a single-frequency/single-longitudinal mode pump source so that the noise spectrum will be free of chaotic noise behavior characteristic of multimode pump sources.
"	EXCLUSIVE- Pump source for system must be 18W or higher, this provides the necessary pump power to reach the required long wavelengths
"	EXCLUSIVE- Integrated spectrometer.  System must have an onboard spectrometer capable of monitoring both wavelength and bandwidth of Ti:S laser. Spectrometer to be addressable via USB.
"	EXCLUSIVE- Service: Vendor must have an established program that guarantees replacement of the laser system should the system have a failure that cannot be repaired on first call. The Coherent warranty program includes the ARU (advance replacement unit) program. While under warranty and service contract, should the laser system have a service issue that can not be repaired in the field directly, the entire system is replaced with an "as new": laser.  "As new" is defined as an identical laser that meets all new factory specification, has undergone all tests and validations, and includes any new engineering enhancements since the original build date. The replaced system must be on a permanent basis, not a loaner program; the replaced system must have remaining warranty of the original system. This is an established and published and highly unique program exclusive to Coherent in support of the Chameleon laser systems.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
