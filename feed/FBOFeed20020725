<DESC>Jones Lang LaSalle, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), and the Air Education and Training Command, anticipates the release  of the Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas on or about 26 June 2002.

Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a two-step RFP process, with an optional 3rd step.  In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Little Rock AFB project.  Jones Lang LaSalle, with Air Force concurrence, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Little Rock project.  In the second (optional) step of the RFP process, Jones Lang LaSalle, with Air Force concurrence, may invite the pre-qualified offerors to participate in a one-day interview and concept refinement presentation.  In the 3rd step, up to three qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals.  Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Air Force.

The Little Rock Project involves the complete renovation of 1,201 units and upgrade of 334 previously renovated units.  The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 1,535 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years.  The Successful Offeror shall also assume the existing financial obligation of the Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs).  The Air Force expects to contribute leased real property and improvements, and may subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror.  The Successful Offeror (SO) will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Little Rock family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  The Statement of Need is available at http://www.jllpsc.com.

<SUBJECT>F -- Seagrass Restoration in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NCND6200200017
<CONTACT>Mitchell Ross, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-713-0820 x141, Fax 301 713-0806, Email Mitchell.J.Ross@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, National Ocean Service, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, Marine Sanctuaries Division requires restoration of seagrass beds in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS).  The requirement includes use of common techniques for restoration of seagrass, including sediment fill, bird stakes, and seagrass transplants.   This is a pre-solicitation notice.  A solicitation will be posted to the Governmentwide point of entry.   Multiple Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity contracts are anticipated to be awarded based on full and open competition for the issuance of firm fixed price Task Orders over a five year period that will include a base year and four one-year option periods.  Seagrass beds are an important component of the Florida coral reef tract, the third largest barrier reef system in the world.  The area was designated a National Marine Sanctuary in 1990 under the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act.   The co-trustees for the FKNMS are the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the State of Florida. The cumulative impact of boat groundings has led to a pervasive scarring of seagrass beds throughout the FKNMS. Seagrass injuries in the FKNMS typically include a combination of propeller scars, blowholes, and berms. Propeller scars are formed by the dredging effect of the turning propeller or propellers as the boat travels over a shallow bank. Blowholes are formed from the concentrated force of propeller wash, either from the grounded vessel attempting to power off the bank or the propeller wash of the salvage vessel pulling the grounded vessel off the bank.  Berms are produced from the sand, coral fragments, and other substrate that typically accumulate around the perimeter of blowholes, thereby burying healthy seagrass.  The co-trustees have the authority, under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) and state law, to implement damage assessment and restoration projects for natural resource injuries.

<CONTACT>Warren Russo, T-FIS Program Manager, 781-377-8629
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A  RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey  being conducted by the United States Air Force (USAF) Electronic Systems  Center (ESC) Tactical Data Links (TDL) System Program Office (SPO) to  determine potential commercial sources capable of designing, developing,  integrating, and implementing a program for the training, fielding,  integration and support of tactical data link weapon systems. The Link-16  TDL system is a key component of the data link systems that extends the  range of the pilot's eyes and ears while airborne. The Link-16 TDL system  is currently being integrated into numerous US Air Force airborne  platforms and will provide improvements in the quality and timeliness of  information to support more rapid  battlespace decision analysis, increased situational awareness, and  shorter decision cycle to advance information superiority and precision  engagement. For example, tactical data links give a warfighter on one  platform access to sensor data generated by other platforms, and actions  on one platform are depicted in near real time on the displays of other  platforms. The Tactical Data Links - Fielding, Integration and Support  (T-FIS) contractor's prime responsibility is to support the development of  training programs that compliment the integrating of the Link 16 tactical  data link weapon system into airborne weapon systems for a variety of USAF  platforms. The T-FIS contractor will travel to locations throughout the  United States as well as numerous air bases in Europe and Asia to: train  pilots and aircrew members on the newly integrated Link 16 capability;  operate, monitor and  support training exercises utilizing Link 16 hardware; and coordinate and  develop plans and schedules that ensure initial training is  accomplished/completed at the receiving units prior to the arrival of the  new Link 16 capability.  The purpose of this announcement is to help the ESC TDL SPO mitigate  program cost, schedule and performance risks by identifying potential  highly competitive firms for the T-FIS contract. This announcement,  together with the subsequent Government analysis of company submittals,  will also help interested potential offerors make a more informed decision  regarding their probability of success and determine whether or not they  should proceed with a full proposal effort. Any information submitted by  respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will  not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this  Sources Sought Synopsis request. The Government requests interested  offerors submit a statement of their qualifications with respect to the  key features discussed above and the criteria below. Responses should  include examples of similar efforts.  The Government expects that interested sources, either alone or with  appropriate teaming partners, should meet the following criteria: (1)  Possess or have the ability to obtain a U.S. Secret level facility  security clearance. (2) Have demonstrated experience in the design,  development, integration, and test of large-scale and complex airborne  command and control systems. (3) Have previous experience with military  command and control operations, e.g.: a) Air Force Applications Program  Development (AFAPD); b) Army Tactical Data Link-1 (ATDL-1); c) Integrated  Broadcast Service (IBS); d) Interim JTIDS Message Specification (IJMS); e)  Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL); f) Tactical Digital Information  Link (TADIL) A (Link 11); g) TADIL B (Link 11B); h) TADIL C (Link 4A); i)  TADIL J (Link 16); j) Variable Message Format (VMF); k) Joint Range  Extension (JRE); l) Additional tactical  data link capabilities to exchange information (e.g., gateway). (4) Have  previous experience with networking integration processes, technology and  solutions inherent in the connection of fixed and mobile ground systems  and aircraft systems. (5) Have previous experience with military  communications systems for line-of-sight (LOS) and beyond line-of-sight  (BLOS) narrowband secure voice radios, as well as narrowband and wideband  secure data links. (6) Have previous experience in the integration of  complex aircraft communications systems, overcoming co-site interference,  achieving both desirable communications performance and interoperability  with other platforms' communications equipment and applications. (7) Have  experience in the field of automated decision-making aids including  machine-to-machine interfaces and associated communications. (8) Have  demonstrated experience with  the design and development of systems incorporating multi-level security  processes, crypto keying equipment, and practices. (9) Have demonstrated  experience in the design and development of systems employing wideband  Local Area Net (LAN) technology, graphics presentation methods, computers  and information processing approaches, as well as the implementation of  Human Machine Interface (HMI) principles. (10) Have demonstrated  experience in relating operational concepts and requirements toward the  reduction of Total Ownership Cost and optimization of Operational  Availability (Reliability and Maintainability) through the application of  Logistic Support practices for large-scale hardware/software systems.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United States Air Force (USAF) Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Tactical Data Links (TDL) System Program Office (SPO) to determine potential commercial sources capable of designing, developing, integrating, and implementing a program for the training, fielding, integration and support of tactical data link weapon systems.  The Link-16 TDL system is a key component of the data link systems that extends the range of the pilot's eyes and ears while airborne.  The Link-16 TDL system is currently being integrated into numerous US Air Force airborne platforms and will provide improvements in the quality and timeliness of information to support more rapid battlespace decision analysis, increased situational awareness, and shorter decision cycle to advance information superiority and precision engagement.  For example, tactical data links give a warfighter on one platform access to sensor data generated by other platforms, and actions on one platform are depicted in near real time on the displays of other platforms.  The Tactical Data Links - Fielding, Integration and Support (T-FIS) contractor's prime responsibility is to support the development of training programs that compliment the integrating of the Link 16 tactical data link weapon system into airborne weapon systems for a variety of USAF platforms.  The T-FIS contractor will travel to locations throughout the United States as well as numerous air bases in Europe and Asia to: train pilots and aircrew members on the newly integrated Link 16 capability; operate, monitor and support training exercises utilizing Link 16 hardware; and coordinate and develop plans and schedules that ensure initial training is accomplished/completed at the receiving units prior to the arrival of the new Link 16 capability. The purpose of this announcement is to help the ESC TDL SPO mitigate program cost, schedule and performance risks by identifying potential highly competitive firms for the T-FIS contract.  This announcement, together with the subsequent Government analysis of company submittals, will also help interested potential offerors make a more informed decision regarding their probability of success and determine whether or not they should proceed with a full proposal effort.  Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis request.  The Government requests interested offerors submit a statement of their qualifications with respect to the key features discussed above and the criteria below.  Responses should include examples of similar efforts. The Government expects that interested sources, either alone or with appropriate teaming partners, should meet the following criteria: (1) Possess or have the ability to obtain a U.S. Secret level facility security clearance.  (2) Have demonstrated experience in the design, development, integration, and test of large-scale and complex airborne command and control systems.  (3) Have previous experience with military command and control operations, e.g.: a) Air Force Applications Program Development (AFAPD); b) Army Tactical Data Link-1 (ATDL-1); c) Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS); d) Interim JTIDS Message Specification (IJMS); e) Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL); f) Tactical Digital Information Link (TADIL) A (Link 11); g) TADIL B (Link 11B); h) TADIL C (Link 4A); i) TADIL J (Link 16); j) Variable Message Format (VMF); k) Joint Range Extension (JRE); l) Additional tactical data link capabilities to exchange information (e.g., gateway).

<CONTACT>Velinda Nix, Contract Specialist, Phone (312) 751-3387, Fax (312) 751-4923, Email morganve@rrb.gov
<DESC>Section I - Background
The purpose of this project is to provide a replacement system for the Watermark Imaging system currently used by the Board Member?s offices (Office of the Chair - Chair, Office of the Management Member - MMO, and Office of the Labor Member ? LMO) located at 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois (headquarters) and for the Washington Legislative Office, 1310 G Street, NW (WLO ? Washington, DC; remote access).  Watermark is no longer being supported. Based on a review of business requirements, RRB staff has recommended that the replacement system be based on eiStream?s Image Pro.  The RRB presently holds a sufficient number of site licenses for Image Pro.  The Secretary to the Board maintains the files. The files are located on the Board Member's Novell server.  The files are stored on the agency?s LAN in Direct Access Storage Devise (DASD) format.  Watermark files are archived to CD-R media after about 1 year.
The steps that are taken by the Secretary to the Board?s office are as follows:
1.	The documents are scanned into the Watermark system.
2.	The input to the document properties and any user fields and values are added to the documents. There are two types of documents currently in the Watermark system.  These documents and the properties are described in detail in the Document Types section.
3.	The original document is saved to the Novell Server and copies of the document are e-mailed to the three Board Office?s Administrative Assistants. The Secretary can attach notes.  The notes provide additional information such as due dates.
4.	The paper is kept in the Secretary to the Board?s office.
The copies are stored on the office Administrative Assistant?s PC, in Watermark System files. The offices can access the original documents on the server in read-only format.
A flow chart for this process is shown in Attachment A.
Section II - Board Office?s Requirements

All three of the offices have requested that the basic process of the system should remain the same.  Additional enhancements that are desired are as follows:

?	Provide a linkage between the Docketing System and the Imaging System.

?	Incorporate Word documents into the system without scanning the document.

?	Provide a query source to locate documents easily.

?	All Approval items must be converted.  The Informational items will be converted based on the cost of the conversion.

?	Confidentiality of the documents is required.

The following sections provide brief descriptions of the background and current process used with the Watermark system.

Section III - Document Types 
There are two types of documents used in the Board offices: Informational Items and Approval items.    To index a document in Watermark, specific details known collectively as document properties are associated with the document.

Individual Office Documents in Watermark
In addition to the documents forwarded to the offices by the Secretary of the Board, each office has the ability to maintain their own informational documents internally. They are able to set up their Watermark filing system according to their own office specifications.  These documents are stored in the Watermark System files on the server location dedicated to the individual office.  Closed out Approval items are also stored in the server files.  The offices manually enter the vote information in the Docket System. 
The steps taken by the individual offices mirror the ones taken by the Secretary of the Board.  Each office maintains their server files. A flow chart of the office?s process is shown in Attachment B.
The average pages for these documents are 3-5. The categories and document volumes used by the Labor Member?s office are in the Attachment C.  The Management Member?s Office and the Chair?s Office currently do not use this process for their internal documents.
Docket System
A database system is currently being used to store and record votes on the Approval Items scanned into the Watermark system.  The database is a Paradox database and the interface is written in Delphi.  The table structure of the database is in Attachment D. 
Conversion Requirements
The documents are in TIFF format.  The Watermark property information shall be converted to Image Pro?s property format.  All Approval documents must be converted.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) is announcing its intent to award a one-year sole source modification under Contract No. 280-97-8014 with ORC MACRO to continue conducting the national evaluation of children's mental health services programs.  In l994, ORC MACRO was awarded a 3-year contract to evaluate 22 grant sites funded in 1993 and 1994 under the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Their Families Program.  Then in 1997, ORC MACRO was awarded another contract to evaluate nine sites funded in September, 1997 for five years, under the same grant program.  In the Child Health Act of 2000, Congress authorized an extension to six years of each grant funded under the Program. This modification contract will extend to a sixth year the national evaluation of the nine program sites funded in FY 1997.  By congressional mandate, the grants must also be evaluated throughout their grant period, which then requires that a sixth year be added to the national evaluation. The objective of this evaluation is to fulfill the statutory requirements of PL 102-321 to assess the effectiveness of the systems of care created by the grant program.  Under this authority, grants support a broad array of community-based, family-focused, coordinated services for children with a serious emotional disturbance that enable communities to develop local systems of care which involve mental health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice, and other agencies.  The evaluation of the Program includes the collection of longitudinal data to assess outcomes for children and their families, and to study the effects of system-of-care activities on the utilization of hospitals and other institutional settings, the barriers to and achievements resulting from interagency collaboration in providing community-based systems of care, and assessments by parents of the effectiveness of systems of care.  This modification will implement some of the protocols and methodologies already developed by CMHS and approved by OMB.   Estimated issuance date of RFP No. 280-97-8014, Modification No. 5 is August 2002.

This on-line service enables USTRANSCOM to have access to the required information to support USCINCTRANS and USTRANSCOM.  A majority of the war fighting Commanders in Chief (CINCs) legislative affairs offices use Congressional Quarterly to track legislation and receive defense-related hearing transcripts, to include the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  A subscription to Congressional Quarterly gives USTRANSCOM access to nearly all defense-related hearing transcripts, reports, and legislation in a timely manner.  Congressional Quarterly notifies customers, on a daily basis, or even three times a day, if the customer requests it, updates on issues the House and Senate are working.  Congressional Quarterly contacts every committee every day to provide the most detailed listings on all scheduled floor, committee and subcommittee action.  Includes dates, times, locations, agendas, contact information and witnesses.  Congressional Quarterly, with 48 hours minimum notice, will cover a defense hearing upon subscriber request; thus, allowing USTRANSCOM to cover all issues that impact and affect mission requirements.  The service is critical in preparing USCINCTRANS for congressional office calls and hearings.

<DESC>The Division of  Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is re-competing and expanding their program on enteric diseases research currently contracted with the University of Maryland at Baltimore under contract N01-AI-65299.  This will be a multiple award solicitation which is to be competed on a Full and Open Competitive basis, NAICS Code 541710. It is anticipated that up to eight (8) cost-reimbursement, completion-type contracts will awarded for a period of seven (7) years. 
This RFP solicits proposals for research units in the Food and Waterborne Diseases (FWD) Integrated Research Network (IRN). The FWD IRN will facilitate the integration of research programs to develop products to rapidly identify, prevent, and treat food and waterborne diseases that threaten public health.  The FWD IRN will:  1) evaluate vaccines, therapeutics, and rapid detection methods; 2) integrate human mucosal immunity with clinical research; 3) increase research and product development activities, and 4) include the ecology and microbiology of food- and water-borne zoonoses as well as drug-resistant pathogens. This RFP consists of four (4) parts:  A-Microbiology Research Units, B- Immunology Research Units, C-Zoonoses Research Units, and D-Clinical Research Units.  Offerors are not required to submit proposals for all parts; however, offerors may submit proposals for only one part, or for any combination of the four parts (A, B, C, and D).  Proposals must be separated so that each part is able to stand on its own.  Multidisciplinary research will be achieved through interactive research projects with the other units of the FWD IRN.  Coordination, administration, and statistical support will be provided to the FWD IRN through a separate solicitation entitled "Coordinating and Biostatistics Center" which is being solicited as RFP NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-28.  
In the event of a public health threat, each unit will be required to respond and research will be re-directed at the direction of the Project Officer.  Therefore, it is envisioned that these units will implement, staff and maintain coordinated groups that can provide activities needed to enhance the U.S. capacity to better prevent, treat and control food and waterborne diseases, especially those associated with agents on the NIAID Category A, B, C priority organisms list.  The ability to enhance and facilitate response and research efforts with the efforts of local, state and federal public health and regulatory agencies in a coordinated biodefense response is an essential part of this contract activity.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for this contract will be a total of seven (7) years. RFP-NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-04 will be available electronically on or about July 29, 2002, may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/. Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>General:  The National Park, Department of Interior, is soliciting proposals for construction firms having the capability to perform the work described below. This solicitation will be issued electronically, on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, at http://ideasec.nbc.gov   Paper copies of this solicitation will not be made available. Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the National Business Center. Proposal documents will be available in Microsoft Word, HTML and Adobe PDF, Specifications will be available in Adobe PDF format, and drawings will be available in TIFF format. Offerors wishing to receive electronic notification of changes will need to register to receive notification of this specific solicitation at http://ideasec.nbc.gov. This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  Subscribers to this service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the http://ideasec.nbc.gov site for all information relevant to this solicitation.  Plan holders will be required to visit this website periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents. No other notifications will be sent. · Proposed Issue Date:  August 8, 2002 · Title of Project:  Rehabilitate the Water System at Apgar/Park Headquarters, Glacier National Park, Montana · Description: The purpose of the project is to rehabilitate the existing water treatment and distribution system that serves the Apgar and Headquarters area. Improvements to the Rubideau spring diversion structure are needed to protect the water source from surface contamination and allow the source to retain its ground water classification. Protection from surface contaminants is vital to ensuring public health and would permit the park to continue current low-cost chlorination treatment. The existing system is over 50 years old and has reached the end of its useful life. Deteriorated piping materials, consisting primarily of asbestos cement pipe, would be replaced with new piping and valves to reduce leaks and maintenance requirements and to improve system reliability and efficiency. The existing system requires continuous flows to prevent freezing and and air locks because of inadequate bury depths and improper pipe gradients/lack of air release valves. Consequently, over half of the water diverted from Rubideau spirng is discharged via pipe back into the Middle Fork of the Flathead River after chemical de-chlorination. The proposed system would have adequate bury depths and gradients so that it would function as a closed system, eliminating the discharge and associated treatment of unused water.  The project also includes an additional underground storage reservoir to increase fire flows for structural fire protection; current storage capacities do not provide adequate fire flows.  A pre-proposal conference is tentatively scheduled to be held on site on or about August 21, 2002. · Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price. Technical capability is considered to be significantly more important than price.  Estimated price range, $3,000,000  to $5,000,000. · Time for completion,  December 1, 2004.  · Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available. · All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service is seeking Qualification Statements from construction contractors desiring prequalification for the award of a lump sum contract with limited unit pricing to provide necessary demolition, repair and or replacement of identified areas and items associated with approximately 198,000 square foot of an existing concrete plenum ceiling located under the existing Old Chicago Main Post Office in Chicago, IL. The total period of performance for this project will be 456 days from notice to proceed and the construction estimate ranges from $10,500,000 to $11,500,000

A detailed scope of work for repair or replacement will be provided in the actual request for proposal.

During the 1930?s the Old Chicago Main Post Office (OMPO) was built on air rights over railroad tracks used by different and continuously operating railroads/authorities (currently Amtrak & Metra) that serve Chicago?s Union Station (CUS). As part of the building construction, an exhaust plenum ceiling was constructed under the post office and above the train platforms and tracks.  The plenum ceiling is a suspended structural concrete slab assembly that incorporates cast iron exhaust flues that generally run continuous above each track.  These cast iron flues, that once captured smoke from steam locomotives, now captures diesel engine exhaust, which flows into the plenum space and then is drawn away through vertical vent shafts by roof mounted exhaust fans on the OMPO roof.  Over time, the plenum ceiling structural slab, its supporting structure and the exhaust flues have deteriorated and now require rehabilitation.
. 
The successful contractor must possess the proven experience, capability and flexibility to schedule and coordinate the required work with the existing railroad authorities at CUS in a manner that will allow the required work to proceed in a continuously efficient manner despite the ever-changing railroad schedules and needs. Accordingly, the contractor will have to identify and schedule second, third, fourth and possibly additional alternative work locations should the proposed first location of repair/rehabilitation not be available. 

Only the most highly qualified contractors will be prequalified. To be considered for prequalification the company must; be financially capable; have been in business for a minimum of five (5) years; provide examples of minimum Experience/Performance requirements of two (2) comparable projects with in the past five (5) years (one of which must be completed). 
 For this project, Comparable Projects are defined as; similar in size and scope for repair work on overhead concrete surfaces in tunnels, under bridges or on similar structures, with a construction cost of $5,000,000 or more as follows:
&#61623; Railroad or rail transit authority concrete tunnel repair/rehabilitation under ?operating? conditions
&#61623; Railroad or rail transit authority concrete tunnel repair/rehabilitation under non-operating conditions
&#61623; Highway concrete bridge or tunnel repair/rehabilitation under operating conditions 
&#61623; Railroad and/or rail transit construction under operating conditions
&#61623; Previous coordination experience with Amtrak/Metra or other railroads
&#61623; Previous concrete ceiling repair/rehabilitation work of similar nature

While highway concrete tunnel or other concrete ceiling repair/rehabilitation projects may be considered railroad tunnel repair/rehabilitation experience is preferred and can achieve a higher rating. 

The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria: Part III, Experience/Performance, includes both Comparable and Non-comparable experience/performance and Part IV Capabilities, includes; Organization, Safety, Backlog, Financial Capability, Bonding and Banking. The Postal Service will select the offeror that provides the overall ?best Value? to the Postal Service, taking into consideration technical and cost related factors. Primary consideration will be given to superior scheduling and management features rather than lowest overall costs. Prequalification packages are available now and may be obtained by email to; mmille20@email.usps.gov or tbonsall@email.usps.gov. Prequalification packages are due by 3:00 PM EST, Tuesday, August 27, 2002 and should be mailed, using one of the services offered by the Postal Service, to Mr. Mike Miller, Major Facilities Purchasing, 4301 Wilson Blvd., Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203-1840. Qualification Statements will not be returned.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Mayo Clinic, of Rochester, MN, for acquisition of one (1) Used Varian Clinic 2100C Linear Accelerator.  The system will be used in the Ionizing Radiation Division, at NIST, in its radiation-dosimetry program, to provide guidelines and standards to the medical oncology community.*****Sole source determination is based on (a) the need for a research quality linear accelerator in mint condition with the same characteristics as those used in clinical settings, and (b) availability of the linear accelerator within eight (8) weeks or less after receipt of the purchase order .  The Varian Clinac 2100C is a state-of-the-art medical accelerator in widespread use throughout the world.  The machine produces a number of electron and high-energy x-ray beams used for the clinical treatment of cancer.  In order for NIST's  instrument-calibration studies/services to provide the most benefit to the medical oncology community, it is critical that the research be conducted on the Varian unit, as it provides a full range of electron beams and the high-energy x-ray beams most often used in the clinic.  The Mayo Clinic owns and operates several Varian linear accelerators for radiotherapy, and they have many years of experience working with these machines.  One of these machines, a Clinac 2100C, is due to be replaced in September 2002, as part of their normal replacement schedule.  The short delivery time of this Mayo accelerator benefits NIST since it will allow a standards program in medical dosimetry to begin in a timely manner.  Mayo will also be providing to NIST a copy of all maintenance and service records on the 2100C linear accelerator. The Mayo Clinic's level of expertise and experience with these accelerators, and their worldwide reputation as a leader in the field of radiation oncology, make them uniquely qualified to meet NIST's requirement.*****Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within eight (8) weeks or less after receipt of purchase order (ARO).*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by August 9, 2002, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.*****

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an extension to the NASA Contract NAS9-97199, with Spacehab for Research and Logistics Mission Support (ReALMS).   The contractor will continue to provide services for an additional 18 months.  The services include providing the Research Double Module (RDM), Logistics Double Module (LDM), Logistics Single Module (LSM) and Integrated Cargo Carrier (ICC) payload carriers with end-to-end payload and mission management and integration and operations services.  The manifest has identified 3 unpressurized carrier flights requiring coverage which fall outside of the current contract period of performance (current contract ends 12/31/03).  Effort for the 3 flights must begin approximately 15 months prior to the scheduled flight date. NASA/JSC intends to continue to purchase these services from Spacehab, from January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005. The authority cited permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government does not believe that competing this effort at this time is to its advantage or to industry's advantage, since the period of performance for this extension is only to cover 3 missions, which may or may not be completed under the extension contract. Any cost savings achieved through competition would be diminished and overshadowed by costs, including phase-in costs, and time delays needed to build relationships with both the ISS Program Office and users of the applications and services provided by Spacehab.  However, NASA does intend to compete this effort in the near future. This effort will be combined and competed as part of the International Space Station (ISS) Mission Cargo effort resulting in a contract to be awarded by 1/1/04. The ISS Mission Cargo effort is consistent with the ISS Program strategy. The strategy developed to consolidate contracts and offer competition opportunities to those who are interested can be viewed at the following website:        http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/excellent-strategy/            The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See note 22.   This procurement is not a 100% small business set-aside.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on August 12, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast Region, Protected Resources Division, St. Petersburg, FL intends to procure the production of a video in Spanish with English subtitles about the creation of coral reef ecosystem.  The object of this project is to create an educational video in Spanish with English subtitles to discuss the role of various habitats from the beach to the reef, including sea grass beds, mangrove forests, and estuarine communities, and the dependence of the coral reef itself on interactions within the larger marine ecosystem in approximately 30:00 minutes.  The objective of this video is to introduce the public of Puerto Rico to their marine environment with an emphasis on the importance of coral reefs and what they can do to maintain this important natural resource.  To achieve this goal, a discussion of threats to coral reef health should be presented with examples of impacted Puerto Rico reef systems.  The interaction between coral reefs and the tourist and fishery trades should also be discussed.  The video is intended to complement a  portable coral reef display the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is creating to illustrate the components of the coral reef ecosystem and the interactions among them in a manner that can be easily understood by school children.  The video is intended for distribution to the public, local NGO's school groups, etc.  This project is being initiated as a component of NOAA/NMFS efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089.  The Executive Order, identified as Coral Reef Protection, seeks to "preserve and protect the biodiversity, health, heritage, and social and economic value of U.S. coral reef ecosystems and the marine environment."  There is currently a lack of educational materials focused on the marine environment of Puerto Rico.  Efforts are needed to make the public aware of the importance or coral reef ecosystems on which much of the tourist and fishery economies of the island depend.  Education and outreach projects are part of the Coral Reef Task Force's strategy to raise public awareness of and appreciation for coral reef ecosystems.  This project will be a partnership between NMFS and FWS, both of which are represented in the Coral Reef Task Force.  The anticipated start date of this project is September 2002.  The completion date is February 2003. The contractor shall collaborate with the NMFS staff to develop on outline for the video and story board and produce a draft prior to the final video.  The final product must be submitted by the end o f the six-month period in the form of a master and five hundred copies and should air on public television. Request for Quotation (RFQ) No. WC133F-02-RQ-0147SKC will be available on or around August 9, 2002.  This is not a Small Business Set-aside.  The small business size standard is $25,000,000 average annual receipts.  The NAICS code is 512110.  The production of the video on creation of coral reef ecosystem in Spanish with English subtitles will be purchased under the guidelines of FAR, Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Offerors interested in receiving a copy of the RFQ should submit a request in writing to the attention of Sharon Clisso at the address listed above.   Facsimile requests will be accepted at (816) 426-7530.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast Region, Protected Resources Division, St. Petersburg, FL intends to procure the production of a video in Spanish about the impacts of fishing gear and illegal take on corals.  The object of this project is to create an educational video in Spanish to discuss the impacts of various reef species fishing techniques, such as nets and bleach, on the reef ecosystem; present less damaging alternatives to these techniques; discuss the illegal take of corals and the take of coral reef species for personal or commercial use; and discuss the laws prohibiting or restricting these activities.  The information shall be presented in approximately 20:00 minutes.  The video shall be for the Spanish-speaking audience of Puerto Rico and is intended for distribution to the public, local NGO's, school groups, etc.   This project is being initiated as a component of NOAA/NMFS efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089.  The Executive Order, identified as Coral Reef Protection, seeks to "preserve and protect the biodiversity, health, heritage, and social and economic value of U.S. coral reef ecosystems and the marine environment."  There is currently a lack of educational materials in Spanish focused on the marine environment of Puerto Rico.  Education and outreach projects are part of the programmatic efforts of NOAA/NMFS to raise public awareness of and appreciation for coral reef ecosystems.  In Puerto Rico, studies have documented the impacts of various fishing techniques and the aquarium trade on coral reefs.  However, efforts are needed to make the public aware of these studies and their results in order to foster the protection of coral reef ecosystems.  The anticipated start date of this project is September 2002.  The completion date is February 2003.The contractor shall collaborate with the NMFS staff to develop on outline for the video and story board and produce a draft prior to the final video.  The final product must be submitted by the end o f the six-month period in the form of a master and five hundred copies. Request for Quotation (RFQ) No. WC133F-02-RQ-0146SKC will be available on or around August 9, 2002.  This is not a Small Business Set-aside.  The small business size standard is $25,000,000 average annual receipts.  The NAICS code is 512110.  The production of the video on impacts of fishing gear and illegal take on corals in Spanish will be purchased under the guidelines of FAR, Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Offerors interested in receiving a copy of the RFQ should submit a request in writing to the attention of Sharon Clisso at the address listed above.

<DESC>Services Required:  A/E services are required for site investigation, planning studies, reports, concept and final design and optional construction phase services associated with general facility maintenance/repair, alterations, additions and renovation projects.  This announcement is open to all businesses.  The government intends to award one (1) Indefinite Delivery Type (IDT) contract for A/E services.  This contract will contain options to extend for four (4) additional years.  The Government reserves the right not to exercise option years.  Of the top five (5) A/E firms, the remaining four (4) A/E firms will be maintained on a pre-qualified firm availability list, in ranking order, for a minimum period of one year for potential future contract award.  Each contract shall have a first year maximum limit of $2,000,000 with an additional $2,000,000 per year for each option year.  Any one delivery order will not exceed $2,000,000.  There will be a minimum consideration of  $25,000 per contract.  Project Information:  Work shall be of a multi-discipline nature involving studies and/or designs for maintenance/repair, alterations, additions and renovation projects to administrative and training facilities at various eastern National Imagery and Mapping Agency sites.  Supporting facility work may include water, sewer, natural gas, electric service, security lighting, parking, storm drainage, information systems, security systems, fire detection and protection systems, lightning protection, and general site work.  It is anticipated that work will begin in fall 2002 and be completed within one year if options are not exercised.

(m)  Firm must be located within a 40 mile radius of Bethesda, MD.  Evaluation Criteria:  Evaluation will be accomplished via two evaluation boards: Pre-Selection Board (PSB) and Final Selection Board (FSB).  The purpose of the PSB is to identify those qualified firms that have a reasonable chance of being considered as most highly qualified by the FSB. The purpose of the FSB is to evaluate the PSB list of qualified firms and recommend at least five (5) firms considered to be most highly qualified, in order of preference.  The PSB evaluation of firms will be based upon professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the services required.  Significant evaluation factors in the order of relative importance (highest to lowest) to the Government are: (a) specialized experience in the type of work required; (b) capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; and (c) past experience with respect to performance on DoD contracts.  A fourth  factor (d) volume of work previously awarded to the firm by DoD, will be used by the PSB as a tiebreaker among equally ranked qualified firms.  The FSB evaluation of firms will be based upon professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the services required.  Significant evaluation factors and their relative order of importance to the Government are: (a) preliminary evaluation selection factors (specialized experience, capacity to accomplish the work, past experience with respect to performance on DoD contracts), (b) firm presentation, (c) past performance ratings maintained in ACASS, and (d) evaluation of the outline Design Quality Control Plan.  Firms will be ranked using the preliminary score for factors (a), (c) and (d). The top ten qualified firms as determined by the FSB will be invited to make a brief presentation to the FSB.  Specific information and format will be provided directly to the top ten firms. The most highly qualified firms will be determined using  (a) the preliminary score and (b) the firm presentation score.  Geographic proximity will be used by the FSB as a tiebreaker among equally ranked qualified firms.  
Submittal Requirements:  Interested A/E firms must submit three copies of SF255 and three copies of SF254 for the prime and all consultants to the above address not later than close of business on the 30th day after the date of this announcement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Health (NIH), is seeking a contractor to provide comprehensive administrative, statistical and clinical trial support for the Food and Waterborne Diseases - Integrated Research Network (FWD IRN).  This new effort is being solicited as a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS CODE 541710, WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES. This contract will provide support to the Food and Waterborne Diseases (FWD) Integrated Research Network (IRN) which is also being solicited at this time as RFP-NIH-NIAID-DMID-03-04. The FWD IRN will facilitate the integration of research programs to develop products to rapidly identify, prevent, treat and diagnose food and waterborne diseases that threaten public health.  It is intended that only one (1) award will be made for the Coordinating and Biostatistics Center (CoBC) RFP that will provide support to approximately 8 (eight) research units.  The NIAID research agenda in Food and Waterborne Diseases will be implemented at the direction of the Project Officer through the Research Units.  The Coordinating and Biostatistics Center will provide the biostatistical and administrative coordination, statistical leadership, data management, operational support, regulatory support, data analysis and reporting in order to successfully integrate the research programs in the Network. In addition, the contractor will be responsible for providing comprehensive clinical trial support for a variety of Phase I and II clinical research efforts.   The Coordinating and Biostatistics Center may also be required to interact or support other Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) studies as directed.  Specific tasks performed within this contract will vary and will be trial specific.  The contractor must have the capacity and capability to work with DMID  specified contractors and must possess the ability and relevant scientific expertise to establish necessary linkages (administrative, logistical, operation, information technology, etc.) as required for sound clinical trial support.  The FWD IRN will have the following research components:  Microbiology Research Unit(s);  Immunology Research Unit(s); Zoonoses Research Unit(s); and Clinical Research Unit(s).  This inter-disciplinary consortia will addresses all food and waterborne pathogens (bacteria, viruses and protozoa) to:  1) evaluate vaccines, therapeutics, and rapid detection methods; 2) integrate human mucosal immunity with clinical research; 3) increase research and product development activities, and 4) include the ecology and microbiology of food- and water-borne zoonoses as well as drug-resistant pathogens.  In the event of a public health threat, each unit will be required to respond by re-direction of its program.  Therefore, it is envisioned that these units will implement, staff and maintain coordinated groups that can provide information needed to enhance the U.S. capacity to better predict, prevent, treat and control food and waterborne diseases especially those included in the NIAID Category A, B, C priority organisms list.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for this contract will be a total of seven (7) years.

<DESC>This is a modification to a previously announced proposed sole source requirement on April 3, 2002 that has now been converted to a competitive acquisition.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented by additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued.  The solicitation number is RA134102RP2010 and is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-07.  The NAICS Code is 334519.  Any amendment(s) hereto will only be published in the FedBizOps.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) operates an ensemble of hydrogen masers for (1) use in the generation of UTC(NIST),(2) as a highly stable frequency reference for use with its primary frequency standard, NIST-F1, and (3) to support research on new cesium standards as well as new optical frequency standards based on calcium atoms and mercury ions.  This ensemble of masers must have the best frequency stability possible, and must also be extremely reliable.  The development of state-of-the-art cold atom, and optical frequency standards is greatly facilitated by the availability of this highly stable frequency reference.  It has saved many months of labor by helping to compare standards, and in helping to identify problems.  The best known frequency source for this purpose is the active, cavity tuned hydrogen maser. To support this effort a new Atomic Hydrogen Maser is required.  This acquisition shall also include an option to purchase a second maser not later than 2 years following the delivery of the first maser.  Reliability requirements demand that it be auto-tuned (that is the cavity tuning of one maser must be independent of any other maser).  The maser must be extremely reliable. The maser must be an existing, off-the-shelf, commercial product with a long history of documented performance.  The maser shall fit into, and meet all performance requirements in NIST's existing environmental chambers (Hotpack model 417532).   The following are minimum requirements and shall be guaranteed:  frequency stability; sigma y (tau = 1 second) (Allan deviation) less than or equal to 2e-13, sigma y (tau = 10 seconds) less than or equal to 5e-14, sigma y (tau = 100 seconds) less than or equal to 1e-14, sigma y (tau = 1000 seconds) less than or equal to 3e-15, sigma y (for tau greater than 1000 seconds and less than 10000 seconds) less than or equal to 3e-15;  long-term frequency stability less than or equal to 2e-16/day (after an extended period of operation); maser shall have cavity auto-tuning (cavity tuning is independent of any other maser); environmental sensitivities shall be (1) less than 1e-14/C for static temperature sensitivity, (2) less than 3e-14/gauss for magnetic field sensitivity, (3) less than 3e-15/kPa for barometric pressure sensitivity, (4) less than 1e-14 for switching to any power source; synthesizer frequency resolution equal to or better than 7e-17; synthesizer frequency control range equal to or larger than 7e-10; output frequencies (greater than 1 V rms into 50 ohms) of 5 MHz, 10 MHz and 100 MHz; operates from 110 VAC, AC power less than or equal to 150 VA, external DC voltage of 22 to 28 VDC, external DC power less than or equal to 90 W; built in battery backup; physical dimensions less than or equal to 107 cm high, 46 cm wide and 76 cm deep.  In view of the fact that a National Metrology Laboratory such as NIST can often characterize the frequency stability of a frequency standard better than the manufacturer, it has been found that many standards perform substantially better than the guaranteed frequency stability specifications.  Therefore the manufacturer is requested to supply as much documentation as possible on the typical values for the following performance parameters; fractional frequency static temperature sensitivity, dynamic temperature sensitivity, sensitivity to relative humidity, magnetic sensitivity for a 1 gauss change, magnetic sensitivity for a 0.1 gauss change, barometric pressure sensitivity, power source sensitivity, and overall Allan deviation from 1 second to 100 days (in a controlled environment).  Reliability is extremely important in NIST's application.  The maser shall have an overall Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of at least 5 years.  Separate information on the MTBF for (1) the physics package (cavity, storage bulb, loss of vacuum, hydrogen disassociator, etc) and (2) all other electronic components shall be supplied.  A strong preference will be given to the maser with the greatest reliability.   One complete set of drawings and manuals shall be provided for the maser.  Delivery of the maser, F.O.B. Destination, to NIST, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80534, shall be made not later than 24 months from Contractor's receipt of contract award.   Once delivered, the Contractor personnel shall perform an on-site verification of maser performance.  A warranty of one year for parts and labor shall be provided.   Delivery of the optional maser shall be made not later than 24 months from Contractor's receipt of the Government's option exercise.  A warranty of one year for parts and labor shall also be provided for the optional item.  Forms and clauses stipulated herein may be downloaded via the internet at the following address: http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  Interested parties are responsible for accessing and downloading documents and forms from that (or any other) site.  Firms without access to the internet may call 303/497-5588 and request that copies of the clauses, provisions, and/or forms be either mailed or faxed to them.   Offers shall include a properly completed and signed Standard Form 1449.  The firm fixed-price shall include all equipment, delivery, and performance verification,  FOB Boulder, Colorado.  The following provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1 (OCT 2000) (provision) "Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items"  // FAR 52.212-2 (JAN 1999) (provision) "Evaluation - Commercial Items" evaluation factors in descending order of importance:   (1) Past performance of vendor, including corporate responsibility (offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references with points of contact for masers already in the field); (2) Reliability - physics package; (3) Reliability - electronics; (4) Documentation of typical performance characteristics; (5) Maser meets or exceeds minimum requirements; and (6) Price.  Past performance and technical, when combined, are more important than price.  //  FAR 52.212-3 (MAY 2002) (provision) "Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items" (NOTE: Offerors shall include with their offers a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3.)  // FAR 52.212-4 (FEB 2002) (clause) "Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items", Addendum 52.217-7 (clause) "Option for Increased Quantity?Separately Priced Line Item (MAR 1989)   // FAR 52.212-5 (MAY 2002) (clause) "Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items including the following additional FAR clauses referenced in FAR 52.212-5, subparagraphs (b) (1) with Alt.

<DESC>FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is conducting a market survey/request for information (RFI) to identify sources, obtain information, and develop an acquisition strategy on a potential requirement for secure air transportation services to facilitate removal (repatriation) from the United States of deportable criminal and non-criminal aliens detained in INS custody.    Possible routes include: from Phoenix, Arizona to Central America including Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras; from Houston, Texas to Central America including Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras; from Alexandria, Louisiana to South America including Columbia; from Alexandria, Louisiana to Caribbean countries including Jamaica, Dominican Republic and Haiti; from Niagara Falls, New York to Lagos, Nigeria. 

The INS believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from potential sources which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the potential requirement.  Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific product, but as an opportunity to improve a possible solicitation package.  Comments should be presented in a clear and concise format with an emphasis on quality, not quantity, of content.  Replies are not mandatory and will have no bearing on eligibility to participate in future acquisitions.       

To facilitate this effort, the INS has developed a DRAFT Request for Proposals (RFP).  Potential sources are encouraged to carefully review the DRAFT RFP and provide comments regarding the following: 1) Industry's capability to provide the comprehensive services described and the anticipated partnering/sub-contracting relationships which might be necessary; 2) Industry's capability to hire, train, and maintain a professional workforce; 3) The adequacy of the aircraft capability and maintenance requirements to address safety and reliability concerns; 4) The anticipated minimum on-time departure/ arrival reliability rate; 5)  The anticipated specifications of aircraft made available for such a program; 6) The ability of industry to obtain airport use rights for the departure/ arrival locations identified; 7) The anticipated minimum lead time between a contract award and contract performance; 8) The content of proposal preparation instructions and evaluation criteria to best assess anticipated successful performance; 9) Recommended best-value considerations important to the source-selection process; 10) Sample pricing estimates/ranges based on the DRAFT RFP pricing schedule.

This market survey/RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a RFP or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire anything.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey/RFI, or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges will be made as a result of the submission of responses to this market survey/RFI or the Government's use of any such information.  If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a pre-solicitation synopsis will be published. The Government is not soliciting proprietary information. If proprietary information is submitted, it must be clearly marked as such and be presented as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  The use of comments received in response to this market survey/RFI will be at the discretion of the INS.  The Government will not critique a potential offeror's comments and reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this market survey/RFI.  

Responses to this synopsis must be received no later than August 22, 2002.  Responses may be submitted electronically or by mail to the primary pointof contact identified in the synopsis.    
The additional documents posted on July 18, 2002 have been revised to clearly indicate that they are drafts.  Those additional documents will be re-posted.

<DESC>Stand alone public address system.  The Foreign Service Institute has a requirement for a two-way public address/intercom system to be designed and installed at the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center at 4000 Arlington Boulevard, Arlington, VA.  The system would be used for training related purposes such as making public announcements to staff and students related to events that impact the classes and as a means of communication related to requests for help in classroom setups or technology or equipment located in the classrooms,  The system should be state of the art and must be able to broadcast to a single location or to all locations independently or together.  The system must be robust enough to carry announcements to all identified buildings and to receive information from designated classrooms in those buildings.  The system must be able to be expanded since there will be additional construction at the Shultz Center to be completed by 2006 and the system must be able to be expanded into that new space.  The public address/intercom system will be a separate system and will not be connected to the Center's existing fire/emergency system.  It will not be used for emergency notification purposes and will not be used for emergency evacuation purposes.  Installation of the system must be separate from areas and must not have any impact on the existing fire/emergency system network and wiring.

There will be a site survey on campus so that vendors may determine sonic characteristics for appropriate number and placement of speakers throughout the facility and determine best technical solutions for both public address and two-way intercom applications.  Site survey will be July 31st at 10:00am.  Interested vendors must email the name, date of birth, and social security numbers of those who plan to attend by July 26th.  Additional names can be received no later than July 30th.  This information should be sent to lewisce@state.gov.

<SUBJECT>R -- STATISTICAL CONSULTING SERVICES
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV intends to award, on a sole source basis, a  purchase order to the West Virginia University Research Corporation, WVU Department of Statistics to provide statistical consultation services in support of Biostatistics Branch of HELD/NIOSH.   The anticipated period of performance is September 29, 2002 through September 28, 2003, with an estimated 60% FTE support requirement.    The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR Part 6.302-3, in that WVU Research Corporation is the only known source within close proximity to the NIOSH with the professional expertise needed.  WVU already provides services of a statistical consultant and a programmer from previous contract activities and this contract will extend and expand services already being provided under a previous contract for an additional year.  The individuals under this contract need  to meet regularly with NIOSH investigators and will use NIOSH computer services that are protected by U.S. government security requirements.  Thus, the statistician and programmer must physically reside at the NIOSH facility on a periodic basis.  They will need to work closely with NIOSH statisticians and investigators on such projects as experimental study design for evaluation of occupational exposures and disease, sample size and power estimates for observational and experimental designs, data analysis to statistically evaluate the effects of exposures and treatment interventions on toxicity and/or disease  or statistical programming and other data management-related tasks.   Therefore, the Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the WVU Research Corporation, Morgantown, WV.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.   Organizations that believe they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and  give written notice to the Contracting Officer within 10 days demonstrating that they have the expertise and capabilities necessary  to meet the stated requirements.  Forward evidence of capabilities and supporting information to:   Rex S. Wolfe, Jr., Reference: #HELD02B0102, DHHS, PHS, CDC,  NIOSH, ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will solely be used  for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days, award will be made to WVU Research Corporation.  All information received will be considered by the Government.
