<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking potential sources qualified under North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code 541690 ($7.0 million). These firms must have the capability to conduct original research, develop new scientific methods, carry out interventional studies, incorporate professional and consumer input into research plans, develop multi-center research protocols, analyze existing health care data, and implement collaborative studies employing prospective designs with other designated institutions.  This research initiative is titled the “Developing Evidence to Inform Decisions about Effectiveness Network (DEcIDE-2)” and assists AHRQ and other Federal Agencies with patient-centered outcomes research, including studies on comparative clinical effectiveness as authorized by Section 1013 of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) and subsequent legislation such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009.  The overarching goal of comparative effectiveness research is to improve patient health outcomes by providing objective scientific evidence to inform the health care decisions of patients, their caregivers, clinicians, and policy makers.  
The primary objective of the DEcIDE-2 Network will be to conduct multiple research studies in close collaboration with AHRQ staff and other institutions that comprise AHRQ’s Effective Health Care program.  The main focus of these research studies will be to examine the comparative clinical effectiveness and safety of health care interventions including the manner in which diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, monitored, and managed.  the following are requirements of this project:
1)  	conduct of prospective observational or interventional studies that evaluate strategies for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP and other health insurance programs, including ways in which medical therapies and diagnostic tests are provided, organized, managed, and delivered; 
2)  	development of valid scientific methods, measures, and instruments that can be rapidly applied to facilitate comparative effectiveness research, clinical care, or program evaluation;
3)  	establishment, maintenance, operation, and analysis of clinical registries that enroll participants based on characteristics such as demographics, disease status, drug exposure, or use of medical device(s);
4)  	evaluation of distributed research networks, data standards, controlled terminologies, and ontologies that enable information system interoperability, comparative effectiveness research, safety studies, registry development and knowledge sharing while maintaining privacy;
5)  	conduct of retrospective and prospective studies to assess various factors that may affect therapeutic effectiveness and patient health outcomes;
6)  provision of technical assistance or consultative support to AHRQ on methods for conducting health outcomes research on the comparative effectiveness and safety of medications, diagnostics, surgery, health systems, and other healthcare interventions; 
7)  	provision of technical assistance in establishing, maintaining, and mining clinical repositories and databases for comparative effectiveness and safety research; 
8)  	evaluation of the feasibility of using administrative, claims, or other existing health data to a) improve oversight, b) support quality, safety, effectiveness, and efficiency initiatives, c) and estimate the impact on patients and populations of changes in clinical practices and insurance program policies; 
9)  	conduct accelerated research that examines the a) outcomes, b) comparative clinical effectiveness, c) safety, and d) appropriateness of prescription medications and other therapies, using existing electronic health databases; and
10) implementation of selected economic analysis including value of information or other quantitative methods for prioritizing the initiation of new research studies.
A series of multiple IDIQ contracts will be awarded for a period of three years. The task orders may be funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment (ARRA) funds, which would require specific reporting requirements. Award is expected on or about July 9, 2010 with proposals due approximately six weeks thereafter.  In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will also be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ’s website at www.ahrq.gov. It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor the FBO site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and monitor the site for any subsequent amendments. Since it is not known who is downloading the solicitation, a bidders list will not be available.

<DESC>The United States Army, Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center located at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806 intends to solicit, negotiate, and award on a sole-source basis to Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) 140 Kendrick Street, Needham, MA 02494 in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.

The Government has a requirement for software license maintenance support for Pro/Engineer, Intralink, and Windchill PDM Link.  The contractor shall provide annual maintenance updates for custom configured, previously procured, and installed user licenses that are currently in place within the ARDEC community.  The primary location for the performance of work under this contract will be at the contractors site.  Applicable FSC is D314, NAICS is 511210.  The period of performance is one (1) 12 month base year and two (2) 12 month option years.  

The type of contract contemplated is a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order to PTC, Corporation.  Pro/Engineer, Intralink, and Windchill PDM Link are highly specialized, proprietary software, which were created and are currently maintained by PTC.  Only PTC can provide the required software licenses and full service support necessary to use these products.  Since PTC is the only company who can provide the necessary support to their software, awarding to another contractor would require changing the actual software ARDEC now uses.  This would result in a substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Utilizing another vendor would result in disruption or stoppage of maintenance support; require extensive training for the Government on the new software, and increase system development, recovery and sustainment costs as well as the loss of valuable time. 

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Point of contact for this requirement is Melissa Wright at melissa.wright3@us.army.mil.  NOTE: Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>RECOVERY – THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE TO INFORMATION SYSTEMS CONSULTING GROUP (INSYSCO) FOR REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Pub.L. 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of intent to issue a modification to an existing, competitively awarded task order.  Task Order 0006 was awarded to a women-owned small business after the requirement was competed using fair opportunity provisions outlined in FAR Part 16.  Task Order 0006 was awarded under an existing Total Information Processing Support Services-3 (TIPSS-3) Indefinite Delivery – Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (TIRNO-06-D-00024).  The modification will be executed as a firm fixed-price action.

The IRS Financial Management Information System (FMIS) is a set of production applications/activities that provides the data necessary to support and prepare the revenue and refund portion of the IRS custodial financial statement.  FMIS provides transaction detail reports and audit trails for all fiscal year cash receipts from Individual Master File (IMF), Business Master File (BMF), and Automated Non-Master File (ANMF) files. These include Integrated Submission and Remittance Processing (ISRP) deposits, Lockbox deposits, Manual Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS) deposits, Remittance Adjustments or Reversals and Electronic Federal Tax Payment deposits.   In addition the FMIS system captures all revenue reclassification amounts from the master files, all refunds, refund reversals, all assessment and abatement adjustment transactions, and all returns. 

This opportunity will provide software development, testing, configuration management and project management support to the FMIS program.  The FMIS program is being expanded in response to legislative initiatives resulting from the enactment of ARRA.  ARRA initiatives related to Bond Rebates, Housing Credit, Health Care coverage provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) and Making Work Pay expand the information that FMIS must capture.

Existing aircraft support is being provided by a G-1 aircraft but additional payload is needed.  Midway Atoll lies 1250 miles northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii.  A potential hazard that must be considered is the presence of nesting colonies of seabirds on the island.  Approximately 3 million albatross may be present from November through July.  Other birds such as bonin petrels, white tern, black noddies, frigates and boobies are also present in substantial numbers during much of the year.  During the months of November through July most flights are at night to avoid bird strikes.  At a minimum aircraft must have a standard airworthiness certificate, seating for 18 passengers, a range of at least 1300 nautical miles, payload of 4900 pounds (with fuel for specified range), cruising airspeed of 250 KTS, and be capable of operating from a 7,900 ft paved runway at sea level at ISA +15 degrees with payload and fuel.  Freight may include food, diving gear, outboard motors, diesel engines, radio antennas, equipment parts, personal goods, mail, and maintenance equipment.  Over night stays at Midway Atoll may be required.  Aircraft and pilots must be certified and checkrided in IFR extended over water operations.  Certification at least under 14 CFR, Chapter 135, Air Taxi Operators and Commercial Operators is required.  Applicable NAICS code is 481211, Nonscheduled Charter Air Transportation.  It is a requirement that the successful awardee be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). The solicitation will be posted here as well as http://amd.nbc.gov under "Current Solicitations" under Business Opportunities.  The solicitation is unrestricted.
The solicitation is anticipated to be released February 24, 2010 closing March 30, 2009. Interested parties capable of performing this requirement should wait to review the solicitation once posted.  At that time if you have questions, call Matt DeLong at 208-433-5029 or send an e-mail to: Matt_DeLong@nbc.gov

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTERS 2009 TASK ORDER CONTRACTORS.

Study and Report on Availability of Open Source Health Info

The purpose of this requirement is to conduct a study and produce a report for HHS on the Availability of Open Source Health Information Technology Systems. This study is mandated in Section 4104b of Title IV of the HITECH Act of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The statute requires that the Secretary of HHS, no later than October 1, 2010, submit a report to Congress on the findings and conclusions of the study to determine the availability, functionality, interoperability and value of open source technology systems along with recommendations for such legislative and administrative action as the Secretary determines appropriate. 

Key Research Questions that must be addressed by the final report produced are:

1.  What is the current availability of open source health information technology  
     systems, especially for use by Federal safety net providers (including small, rural  
     providers)?

2.  What is the total cost of these systems and how does this compare to the total cost of 
     proprietary commercial products currently in use?

3.  Can existing open source systems address the needs of diverse populations (e.g. 
     children, disabled)?

4.  Are open source systems capable of facilitating the interoperability of health information?

5.  Can open source systems be used to support the meaningful use of health information 
      technology?

This high performance green building project will continue the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation through the preservation and modernization of a historic federal building. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program commissions our nation&rsquo;s most talented architects, engineers, landscape architects, and interior designers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 &ndash; 100 years of service. GSA Design Excellence projects demonstrate the merit of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs, aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA&rsquo;s P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS).

Projects in or affecting historic properties must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Secretary of the Interior&rsquo;s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This facility must be designed in metric units. This project will be delivered through the Design-Build delivery method. PROJECT DESCRIPTION The project consists of a major modernization upgrade project for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building (FB) and a window replacement project for the adjacent Byron G. Rogers U.S. Courthouse. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The FB occupies a prominent position in the Federal District of downtown Denver. It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 18 stories and a basement. The FB contains 494,156 gross square feet (GSF), 437,551 rentable square feet (RSF), and 329,433 usable square feet (USF). The current FB tenants will be relocated prior to the start of the modernization project. Agencies to be located in the federal building will be the Commission on Civil Rights, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Social Security Administration, and the General Services Administration. The courthouse is a multi-tenant office and court building. It is five stories high with a basement and subbasement connected to the FB by a two story section. This section contains building services, a loading dock, and a two lane ramp to the parking garage. The courthouse houses six major tenants including United States District Court, Court Administrative Support Center, Probation and Pre-Trial Services, U.S. 10th Circuit Library, 10th Circuit Mediation and the United States Marshals Service. The building is approximately 248,000 GSF including two levels of underground parking spaces within the basement and sub-basement. A comprehensive modernization project for the courthouse was completed in 2005. The courthouse will remain occupied while the windows are replaced. The federal building and courthouse are located at 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado, 80294. Both buildings are long-term GSA-held assets situated in a prime location near downtown with public transportation within the central business district, in the Federal District of downtown Denver, with a stable tenant base and a high reinvestment need. Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the tenants&rsquo; existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. GSA requires all new construction, renovation, and modernization projects to be certified through the LEED program; owing to the historic significance of the building, all work will follow the Secretary of the Interior&rsquo;s Standards and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, Revised 1992 (36 CFR 67); upgrade the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; upgrade the mechanical piping, heating, and hot water systems; upgrade the electrical system and install new telecommunications infrastructure; modernize all elevators; remove all asbestos containing materials (ACMs); implement GSA&rsquo;s workplace procedures and achieve measurable effectiveness results; identify design strategies that work to optimize the project&rsquo;s access to energy from seasonal solar, natural lighting, and wind to reduce undesirable loads and maximize desirable loads to meet desired energy targets for the facility; upgrade by replacing all public and private restrooms, plumbing systems, and fixtures; upgrade building security; replace underground water and waste water service lines.

<DESC>This project is a Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Set Aside. The Government will only accept bids from HUBZone businesses.<BR><BR>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) solicitation for construction at Fort Riley, Kansas based on Lowest Price. The purpose of the IFB will be to solicit and award a Design-Bid-Build Construction project for construction of six standard design, earth-covered igloos and one ammunition storehouse located at Fort Riley, Kansas. The Government proposes to issue a firm fixed price type contract for this project. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.<BR><BR>Estimated contract duration is not to exceed (NTE) 540 calendar days for the base contract. The successful bidder will be required to furnish all labor, materials, permits, equipment and services necessary to perform a firm fixed price Design-Bid-Build construction type contract. Construction services to be performed under the firm fixed price contract will consist of constructing six standard design, earth-covered magazines (ECM) (Igloos) and one ammunition Storehouse (small arms warehouse). Three igloos will be the standard medium (1618 SF each) size and three will be the standard large (2178 SF each) size igloos. Igloos are located within the existing ammunition supply point. Supporting facilities include access roads with an apron for truck maneuvering, electrical service, lightning protection, site improvements, and intrusion detection (IDS) systems. The igloos will have natural ventilation. The warehouse will have mechanical ventilation. The warehouse is a pre-engineered metal building programmed at 7000 sf. The warehouse is utilized as receiving and sending station for ammunition. This building is not required to have conditioned air and will be open storage space with no offices or facilities. Each building will require electrical service and telecommunications, but no water, sewer or buried storm sewer is required for this project. A small amount of roadway will be constructed to facilitate large trucks maneuvering within the ammo storage area. Four roads are included in construction, three new asphalt roads and an existing road.  The new asphalt roads (roads B, C and D) shall be constructed to provide access to the new earth covered magazines.  The existing road, Road A, will have the pavement stripped and repaired to an aggregate base course.  The bid schedule provides an option for Road A to have the pavement stripped to the sub-grade and replaced with a new section consisting of an 8in Lime-modified sub grade, 15 in sub-base course, 4 in aggregate base course, and an asphalt concrete intermediate and surface courses.<BR><BR>The estimated magnitude of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.<BR><BR>The North American Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is: 236220.<BR><BR>Small Business size standard for this project is: $33,500,000.<BR><BR>At this time, no pre-solicitation conference is planned for this solicitation.

<DESC>Manufacturer Product Demonstration for Automatic Endoscope ReprocessesThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is engaged in the process of reviewing and revising policies and procedures related to the use and reprocessing of videoendocopes with the goal of improving patient safety. One of the areas identified as providing an opportunity for improvement is that of standardization of Automatic Endoscope Reprocesses (AERs). Through standardization of AERs it is expected that there will be a reduction in the number of different processes required for reprocessing, maintenance, and repair. As a result, the number of potential errors may be reduced, improving patient safety.  Therefore, the VA is interested in hosting a Product Demonstration Presentation on March 9, 2010 - March 11, 2010 as a part of marketing research. The product demonstration will be held at the VA National Acquisition Center located at 1st Avenue 1 block North of Cermak Road, Hines, Illinois 60141. March 9, -11, 2010 between the hours of 8:00 am and 3:00 pm. Participants will have approximately two hours for product demonstration to include set-up and break-down of equipment. The presentation should include the following, but not be limited to:1.	New Automatic Endoscope Reprocesses The steps required to properly and safely clean endoscope products 2.	The use of necessary charts and diagrams.3.	The availability of Leasing Arrangements4.	Continuing Education and Training Programs (initial and refresher) 5.	Technology Update Programs6.	Leasing vs. buying equipment optionsStandardization of Maintenance and Repair of AERs.In summary, the goals of this project are to solicit from manufacturers proposals to include:1)	Supplying all AERs  for each center, all of one generation or model to the extent possible2)	Making provisions for periodic replacement at specified intervals and/or when major model changes occur3)	Providing all maintenance and repair4)	Providing initial training, periodic site visits, refresher training, and instruction in changes, new developments or identified problems that could pose patient safety risksNote: The VA will entertain only one demonstration of a particular manufactures' specific AER model, even if it is marketed by more than one vendor. Therefore, interested participants should contact Mr. Marlon Powell, at (708)786-4927 marlon.powell@va.gov by February 26, 2010 to coordinate attendance. Interested participant should provide information by the above date concerning whether they are a manufactures or distributor of the AERs, whether they will demonstrate one or more different types of reprocesses. Identify the make and model of the product being demonstrated. To eliminate duplication of efforts the distributor will not have to present the same product demonstrated by the manufacturer.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: US ARMY RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE RUGGED FLEXIBLE WATERPROOF DISPLAY FOR HEAT STRAIN INDICATION<BR><BR>BACKGROUND Warfighters operate with uniquely high levels of physiological strain, especially thermal-work strain.  The objective of this Request for Information is to determine the availability of low power, rugged flexible display technologies suitable for integration into an existing chest-strap mounted personal physiologic/thermal strain monitoring system.  This type of integrated system will enable Warfighters to more effectively manage thermal-work strain during a variety of strenuous training missions, some of which involve wearing encapsulating protective clothing ensembles.<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION The US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, USARIEM, seeks to identify flexible display technologies suitable for integration into a Warfighter-worn physiologic/thermal strain monitoring system.  The initial system would consist of a COTS medical grade chest-mounted physiologic monitor, i.e. Hidalgo Equivital, Zephyr Bio-Harness, wirelessly linked to a small rugged waterproof and flexible display device.  The display would provide an index of the wearer's current physiologic strain and a trend indicator for the strain levels.  This display is envisioned to be primarily worn as a gauntlet-style device, although it may also be utilized as a patch or tag clipped to the uniform.  Initial devices will link to the chest-mounted system via an industry-standard Bluetooth link.  Follow-on devices will have a low-signature inductively coupled link to the chest strap.  Other desired features: 1) sunlight readable; 2) monochrome or grayscale (4-8 levels); 3) capable of displaying simple graphics; 4) flexible enough to conform to a Warfighter's forearm; 5) rugged; 6) waterproof; 7) small: reference size: 35 mm x 55 mm x 4mm.  A leader/medic variant may also be developed with a reference size of 55mm x85 mm x 4mm; 8) low power: capable of supporting mission durations of days to weeks without the necessity of being re-charged; 9) at end of the display's useful life, all materials used must be capable of being fully and easily recycled.  A relatively slow display response time (e.g. 2 seconds) is acceptable.  <BR><BR>CANDIDATES To respond to this RFI, interested parties are required to submit the following to enable the Government to effectively evaluate the proposed technology: <BR>1.	Reference design, including display area and overall device size and weight<BR>2.	Display characteristics to include update rate, size (range) of characters, pixels if appropriate, icons and any graphics capabilities<BR>3.	Proposed method of associating the display with the chest-strap Bluetooth host<BR>4.	Estimates of shelf life, working life, power consumption<BR>5.	Materials list<BR>6.	Estimated costs and time to develop a working prototype display, including the costs and availabilities of the base technologies proposed<BR>7.	Estimated unit costs of the initial Bluetooth-based device.<BR>The focus of this RFI is solely on display technologies, not on the development of a physiological monitor.  Submissions that include development of a physiologic monitoring capability will not be considered.  All materials are due by COB 31 March, 2010 at USARIEM.  All information and material submitted in response to this RFI that are marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any information or material submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the government for such information or material.  Preferred submission format is Adobe's Portable Document Format, PDF.<BR><BR>CONTACT: Please submit responses to this notice to Mr. Stephen Mullen, US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, MCMR-EMB, Kansas St., Natick, MA, 01760.  THIS NOTICE IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document exists.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI) USAF Communications Squadrons Requirement
<SOLNBR>Metrics04C0003LM
<RESPDATE>031110
<CONTACT>Michael V Lee, Contracting Officer, Phone (240) 857-2157, Email michael.lee@bolling.af.mil - Ronette C McBean, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-981-2361, Fax 301-981-3168, Email ronette.mcbean.ctr@afncr.af.mil
<DESC>1. BACKGROUND. The United States Air Force (USAF) has a requirement to improve the quality of IT Service Management within the Communications Squadrons. The USAF is working on standard Performance Work Statements (PWSs) to support Communications Squadron activities. Current plans are to compete these requirements under the Network Centric Solutions-2 (NETCENTS-2) NetOps and Infrastructure Solutions Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts vehicles when awarded. In order to complete the metrics and service delivery summary portions of the PWS templates, the USAF requires vital information on industry's most-common service levels among external service providers and service recipients, as well as the high, low and most commonly used metrics being utilized by industry. This type of information would allow the USAF to create an improved service-level/performance based metric that can be assigned to each category of the current PWS templates to be utilized by Air Force and DoD customers.<br /><br />2. PURPOSE. The USAF is interested in receiving industry's recommended approaches on forward-looking metrics that will drive improved network performance and real customer satisfaction. Specifically, the USAF is interested in predictive metrics to allow lead time to take actions and prevent outages. Additionally, the USAF is interested in metrics that use information from industry recognized tools and applications to give early indication of potential trouble areas in the network or services provided. The USAF may also consider using some of these metrics in the PWS for the future re-compete of the 844th Communications Group Information Technology (IT) Services contract (FA7012-04-C-0003). The USAF also plans to hold 1-hour meetings with interested companies at which time the Government could discuss ideas with leading companies in the IT community.
<p>3. REQUIREMENTS.<br />The following are service areas that the Government would like input and feedback on customer service level/performance based metrics.<br /><br />a. Infrastructure Support<br />i. LAN/WAN Infrastructure Support<br />ii. Network Infrastructure Support<br />iii. Network Integration<br />iv. Network Encryption<br />v. Network Architecture/Configuration Management<br />vi. Systems Administration<br />vii. Telephone Switch Operations and Maintenance<br />viii. Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN) Support</p>
<p>b. Network Operations<br />i. Network Infrastructure Security<br />ii. Performance Management Services IAW AFI 33-115V1<br />iii. Security Management Services IAW AFI 33-115, volume 1, paragraph 7.2.1.4<br />iv. Enterprise Storage<br />v. Configuration Management<br />vi. Fault Management</p>
<p>c. Client Service Center<br />i. Help Desk<br />ii. Network Operations/Control Center<br />iii. Customer Satisfaction</p>
<p>3. DISCLAIMER. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.</p>
<p>4. CONTACT INFORMATION. The 1-hour one-on-one meetings will be on a first-come basis during&nbsp;March and&nbsp;April 2010. Interested firms are required to schedule their participation in the meetings no later than 22&nbsp;Mar 2010. Responses should be submitted by e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Michael V.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS code, 541611, that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge in the area of talent management products and services.</p>
<p>The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program at the U.S. Department of Commerce's (DoC) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland is a nationwide network of centers and resources transforming manufacturers to compete globally, supporting greater supply chain integration, and providing access to technology for improved productivity. MEP centers work directly with small manufacturers to provide expertise and services tailored to their most critical needs, which range from process improvements and worker training to business practices and applications of new technology. Solutions are offered through a combination of direct assistance from center staff and outside consultants.</p>
<p>The MEP system of centers and field offices in all fifty states and Puerto Rico is funded by federal, state, local and private resources to provide these services to manufacturers. As part of MEP's "next generation" strategy, the Program Development Office of MEP is researching, developing and testing new tools and methodologies regarding talent management, which will be utilized to implement new product and service offerings delivered through, and in partnership with, the national network of MEP Centers to small and medium size manufacturers. The goal of this effort is to ensure that small and medium size manufacturers have the appropriately skilled workforce in the quantity that they need to succeed and thrive in the new global economy, and to complement and supplement, rather than replace or compete with, existing public sector offerings around workforce and talent development.</p>
<p>NIST MEP seeks information on potential sources with demonstrated tools and methodologies in the following areas:</p>
<p>1) Talent management and workforce planning including leadership, culture, and the life cycle of talent within the organization.<br />2) Skills analysis including intra-firm analysis of incumbent worker knowledge, skills, and abilities and subsequent gap analysis on knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to transform the firm into new product lines, markets, and customers.<br />3) Training and development planning to help firms analyze cost-benefit of different approaches, techniques, and investment returns regarding training choices.<br />4) Benchmarking human capital practices to maximize return on investment.<br />5) Career Ladder identification and analysis both into and out from different occupations, and both within and across divisions and units.</p>
<p>Additionally NIST seeks familiarity with MEP's "next generation" strategy with its increased focus on workforce development; and knowledge of manufacturing extension programs and their relationships to talent and workforce development programs, practices, and projects.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The NAICS code for the project is 541990.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The small business size standard is $7M.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, NCI approved the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial in January 1991. Contracts were awarded in September 1992. Ten Screening Centers (SCs), a Coordinating Center (CC), and a Laboratory (Lab) were competitively selected. In July 2009, the NCI approved the continuation of centralized follow-up of PLCO participants beyond the originally planned 13-year follow-up period.<span>&nbsp; </span>Currently the 10 Screening Centers are conducting the follow-up activities and the intent is to administer follow-up&nbsp;through a&nbsp;single contractor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Divisions of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) and Cancer Prevention (DCP) is proposing to contract for services to support centralized follow-up of Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial participants who have agreed to continued PLCO participation to obtain cancer diagnosis-, death- and risk factor-related data on these participants to determine if screening for the named cancers reduces deaths from these cancers. Approximately 155,000 men and women were enrolled in PLCO between 1993 and 2001. An anticipated 80,000 to 90,000 participants will be included in centralized follow-up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objectives:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The purpose of this proposed acquisition is to identify qualified organizations that can provide support to the NCI for centralized follow-up of participants from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial with minimal delay while maintaining the highest quality standards for the project. PLCO is designed to determine if screening for prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancer can reduce mortality from these cancers. In addition, PLCO has a collection of pre- and post-diagnostic biological samples stored in the PLCO Biorepostory, and epidemiological data from questionnaires. These data are a valuable resource for cutting-edge molecular epidemiologic research. The value of the resource can be increased 1) by continuing the active follow-up of PLCO participants for at least a 5-year period (2010-2015); 2) by updating key exposure data and collecting additional data, including medication use and medical conditions that are common among older adults; and 3) collecting additional clinical data and tumor tissue of selected cancers, such as that of the colon and ovaries.<span>&nbsp; </span>The centralization of the PLCO will enhance the value of the PLCO resources through the substantial increase in the number of incident cancers accrued within the Trial, strengthen the Trial&rsquo;s ability to clarify further the long-term effects of screening on cancer mortality, and provide a final opportunity to collect additional exposure data and expand the existing tumor pathological resource within the PLCO. Given the rich collection of biological specimens across multiple time points and the extensive questionnaire data, the continuation of the PLCO Trial is essential and will enable the PLCO to remain as one of the premier resources with a unique and comprehensive database for future molecular epidemiologic research.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Requirements:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The proposed acquisition will involve the following type of activities: 1) Establish a Central Data Collection Center (CDCC) for the continued, centralized follow up of PLCO participants for approximately five years,<span>&nbsp; </span>2)<span>&nbsp; </span>Develop a mechanism to transfer data from the central data collection server to the existing PLCO Coordinating Center,<span>&nbsp; </span>3)<span>&nbsp; </span>Prepare IRB Submissions as required, 4)<span>&nbsp; </span>Conduct Annual Study Update Administration to determine participants&rsquo; current health and identify newly diagnosed cancers, 5) Conduct Risk Factor Questionnaire Administration to enhance key exposure data, 6) Conduct Health Screening Questionnaire (HSQ) Administration to assess current screening behavior in the cohort, 7) Conduct Retention Activities to keep participants engaged in the study, 8) Conduct Tracing Procedures for participants lost to follow up, 9) Conduct Medical Record Collection and Abstraction for identified cancers,10) Conduct Pathology Tissue Collection from identified cancers,<span>&nbsp; </span>11) Collect Death Certificates from next of kin of deceased participants or from state agencies to ascertain the cause of death, 12) Provide coordination with the PLCO Sites to establish scientific and administrative liaisons with personnel from the ten original PLCO Screening Centers to facilitate clinical data collection, if needed, 13) Identify Sites that will need to submit to State Tumor Registries, <span>&nbsp;</span>14) Establish a toll-free Call Number for PLCO Participants and 15) Establish a PLCO Website for PLCO Participants.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated Period of Performance:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The anticipated period of performance for the proposed acquisition will be from November 2010 to October 2015; for a period of five years.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis

Title:  Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics  for Safety-Related Equipment in Nuclear Power Plants (AD&P)

*Note, AD&P is On Line Monitoring and cross checking of measured plant variables in the interest of detecting and correcting calibration problems, has already been investigated by NRC and is not included in the present sources sought notice.  The results of those reports are reported in NUREG/CR 6895.*

A.  General Information

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing this Sources Sought as a means to determine the range of available contractors that exists and assess their capabilities to assist the NRC in performing the work described below in Section B.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541330 – “Engineering Services.”   

This is a sources sought synopsis.  This notice does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is the government obligated to issue an RFP.  The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of conflict of interest (COI). For information on NRC COI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5 (www.nrc.gov/who-we-are/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are invited to submit a response.  The capabilities package submitted by a vendor should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and responsibility to perform the principal components of work listed below.  The package should also include past performance/experience regarding projects of similar scope listing the project title, general description, the dollar value of the contract, and name of the company, agency, or government entity for which the work was performed.  Responses should be submitted in Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel format.  Submittal of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged. Responses are due no later than March 4, 2010.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information.  Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable.  Facsimile (301-492-3437) or email (Michele.Sharpe@nrc.gov) responses are acceptable or responses may be mailed to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Michele D. Sharpe, Division of Contracts, Mail Stop TWB-01-B10M, Washington, DC 20555.     

It is not NRC's intent to publicly disclose any vendor proprietary information obtained during the sources sought notice. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the FOIA and other laws and regulations, information identified by a Respondent as "proprietary" or "confidential" will be kept confidential; however, the Government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this sources sought notice.  It is emphasized that this notice is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as any commitment by the Government.  Due to a variety of limitations, the NRC does not plan to entertain questions related to the substance of this sources sought notice.  Pre-solicitation and/or pre-proposal conferences may be held, pending the level of interest.  


B.  General Scope of Work  

Overview:

Mechanical equipment typically exhibits indication of impending failure well before a failure has actually occurred.  For example, the acoustic noise produced by a severely worn but still functional bearing assembly is noticeably different from the noise produced when the bearings are new.  Various technologies facilitate the monitoring and interpretation of these indications, and provide insight into the condition of the equipment and may even facilitate estimation of remaining life.  With these insights, plant personnel can schedule maintenance in anticipation of failures.  Such insights may help to determine whether near term emergency maintenance is warranted to avoid equipment failure, or whether it would be reasonable to delay action until the next scheduled maintenance period.

Digital equipment, such as may be used for plant protection and control, typically has self test features and may have automatic calibration verification, automatic recalibration, and other advanced features designed to improve performance and availability.

The Technical Specifications (TS) for a nuclear power plant mandate inspection and maintenance activities for plant equipment, including evaluation of readiness and performance, and including evaluation of instrument calibration.  AD&P may be useful in evaluating and possibly altering the scheduling and nature of those inspections and maintenance activities.  With an effective AD&P program, it may be reasonable to extend some of the inspection and maintenance intervals.  Or, AD&P may reveal a need for inspection and maintenance activities that are not included in the TS but which should be performed anyway and possibly considered for inclusion in the TS.

NRC Staff is interested in exploring the current state of the art in this area, and in gaining insight into aspects of this area that are presently under investigation and which may be expected to become feasible within the next several years.  Ultimately, NRC Staff will need to determine what, if any, changes to NRC regulations or guidance may be appropriate in anticipation of the use of these technologies in connection with plant mechanical and digital equipment.

The provider of this research must meet the qualifications specified below.  These requirements apply both to the responding organization and to the individual persons who will be involved in this effort.  For any person or organization not meeting ALL of the specified requirements, respondents should explain why particular requirements should not be considered applicable to those particular persons or organizations.


Required Qualifications:

Each person and each organization providing technical services on behalf of the respondent must meet the following qualifications, or the respondent must show that specific qualifications are not applicable to specific individuals or organizations.  All personnel and organizations must have:

1.  Extensive experience in the nuclear power industry in the United States, including, for example: experience in:
     *plant technical specifications and the associated bases
     *surveillance testing requirements for mechanical, electrical, and digital equipment
     *condition monitoring for mechanical, electrical, and digital equipment.

2.  Extensive experience in the regulations and guidance of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and in applicable laws and requirements.

3.  Lack of Conflict of Interest concerns, both in regard to individual persons and in regard to organizations (see commercial / legal considerations elsewhere in this sources sought notice).

4.  Extensive experience in the technical areas described in this sources sought and in all technical areas required to support these efforts, including, for example:
     *diagnostic and prognostic techniques for mechanical, electrical, and digital equipment
     *automated testing of mechanical, electrical, and digital equipment
     *manual and automated condition monitoring techniques
     *automated self testing in digital monitoring, safety, and control systems
     *statistical modeling and analysis of analog sensor signals both off  line and in real time
     *statistical analysis in a sparse data environment
     *automated pattern recognition
     *analysis and interpretation of acoustic and electrical noise

5.  Extensive experience in academic and physical research, including publication of reports directed toward expert and general audiences.


Each respondent should:

1.  Describe experience and publications that demonstrate the respondent’s capabilities in these areas.

2.  Show that all personnel and organizations that may provide technical services in these efforts on behalf of the respondent meet all of the qualifications specified above, or that specific qualifications are not applicable to specific persons or organizations.

3.  Describe any schedule or resource issues that may constrain the respondent’s:
     *submittal of a detailed formal proposal in response to a request issued within several    months of the date of this sources sought notice
     *execution of the efforts described herein, in the event work were to be requested to begin within one year of the date of this sources sought notice (NRC intends to be flexible in the scheduling of the work described herein, in recognition of respondent constraints)  

4.  Provide any other documentation or evidence that the respondent believes demonstrates appropriate qualification and capabilities — respondent should recognize that clarity and concision will be considered germane.

<a href="mailto:tina.m.krawczyk@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a Sources Sought Announcement for construction of fish passage facilities at Turner Reservoir Dam, Hunts Mill Dam, and Omega Dam, Ten Mile River, East Providence, Rhode Island. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990 with a size standard of $33.5 M. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.<BR><BR>The project is planned to be issued/solicited in March 2010 and the performance duration is estimated to be 500 calendar days.  <BR><BR>The Ten Mile River is located in East Providence, Rhode Island at the head of Narragansett Bay directly to the east of Providence, Rhode Island. The proposed aquatic ecosystem restoration plan would restore anadromous fish migration to the lower Ten Mile River. The plan consists of providing fish and eel passage at the three lowest dams on the Ten Mile River: Omega Pond Dam, Hunts Mill Dam and Turner Reservoir Dam. The projects may be issued together as one solicitations or separately with Turner Reservoir and Hunts Mill Dam being issued as one solicitation package in April 2010 and Omega Dam issued as a separate solicitation in late summer.  <BR><BR>The proposed Turner Reservoir Project consists of constructing a 4- foot wide concrete Denil fish way that would be placed adjacent to the eastern abutment of the concrete spillway. The fish way is made of reinforced concrete ramp that will extend from the base of the dam to the top of the spillway with a 15-foor vertical rise. The entrance to the fish way would be situated in the stilling basin at the base of the spillway. As the inlet faces downstream at a 45-degree angle, the fish way makes a 135-degree turn before ascending 6 feet to a 10- foot turning pool. The upper sloping leg of the fish way is 60 feet long ascending another 7.5 feet and terminates at an exit channel about 22 feet long. This exit channel would be cut into the spillway about 1.1 feet. Upstream passage would be provided via a 3- foot wide by one-foot deep notch in the spillway. This notch would be situated about 19 feet from the eastern spillway abutment. Cofferdams will be required to de-water the construction area. Less than 100 cubic yards of riverbed material will be excavated in order to construct the foundation that will be supported on drilled shafts. The dredged materials will be disposed of at an approved upland site.<BR><BR>The proposed Hunts Mill Dam project consists of constructing the concrete Denil fish way within the existing historic mill foundation adjacent to the western side of the dam. The entrance to the fish way would be situated near the base of the dam. As the inlet faces downstream at a 20-degree angle, the fish way makes a 110-degree turn before ascending 3 feet to a 10-foot turning pool. The upper sloping leg is 42.5 feet long ascending another 5.4 feet and terminates at an exit channel about 11 feet long. A trapping system would be constructed within the exit channel. Salvage and restoration of a historically significant stone masonry will be required. Cofferdams will be required to dewater the construction area.<BR><BR>The proposed Omega Dam project consists of constructing a 4-foot wide concrete Denil fishway adjacent to the left abutment of the spillway to provide upstream fish passage. The entrance channel to the fishway would be 30-inches wide and be situated at the base of the spillway at a 45-degree angle to the direction of flow. The fishway would then widen to 4 feet as it turns 135 degrees. After a 10-foot level section, the fishway would ascend parallel to the spillway/bridge abutment for a length of 42.5 feet. The fishway then turns180-degrees at a 10-foot long turning/resting pool. Then it would ascend an additional 57.5 feet to an 8.5-foot long exit channel to be cut into the existing spillway. Cofferdams will be required to dewater the construction area. There is also an existing 16 gas line that needs to be removed and replaced within the construction area. <BR><BR>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following: business classification (i.e. HUBZone etc.) as well as qualifications of the team and experience in performing the work requirements stated above. Firms must submit past demonstrated experience to include at least two examples of projects they completed similar in scope and magnitude to the project described above. Additionally, interested firm should indicate their experience in:<BR><BR>1.	Control and diversion of water for riverine construction, including subsurface dewatering. They need to be experienced in construction of cofferdams for river diversion and control, in tidal river environments. Also need to be experienced in groundwater control with regards to excavations in the 10 to15 feet depth range in pervious ground with high water tables. <BR>2.	Installation of drilled shafts with height restrictions.<BR>3.	Custom form work and shoring for cast-in-place concrete. Experience may be demonstrated by citing projects that involved dams, spillways, retaining walls or hydraulic structures.<BR>4.	Urban infrastructure, including concrete/masonry repair and rehabilitation. Work on historically significant structures involving concrete/masonry repair and rehabilitation. Experience may be demonstrated by citing projects where masonry was salvaged for re-use or where unique materials or procedures were required to preserve aesthetics features,<BR>5.	Construction of Denil fishways with entrance channel, denil baffle section, and exit channel. <BR><BR>Proof of bonding capability is required. Responses are due March 3, 2010. Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN: Tina Krawczyk. Responses are limited to twenty (20) pages.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to issue a sole source procurement toChanging Billing Focus Internationally, Inc. (CBFI), under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2.  This procurement is to provide on-site Billing, Insurance Verification, Pre-Registration and Accounts Receivable services for the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, PA.

It is the belief of the Government that there is currently only one responsible source capable of providing this service to satisfy the agency requirement.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>SUBJECT: SA-309913-01-ENC1000 A94-00 Standard Features<br /><br />REF NO.: F1S0AE0021B001<br /><br />DUE: 23 February 2010<br /><br />POC: Timothy Palen, 661-277-8470; Zachary Bawden, 661-277-7583<br /><br />DESC: The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB intends to award a sole source, Firm-Fixed Price contract, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) <br />Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to Enerdyne Technologies, Inc. The NAICS code is 334220.<br /><br />The AFFTC has a requirement for SA-309913-01-ENC1000 A94-00 encoders. These encoders will be used to digitize and compress analog video signal formats and allow the user to transmit data in a noisy environment by correcting a number of bit errors received at the ground site. The AFFTC will be using the encoders within the F-16 program. These encoders must be compatible with the existing Enerdyne decoders that are installed in the aircraft. The technical data and specifications of the encoders and decoders are designed and developed by Enerdyne Technologies, Inc, and are proprietary to the company. It has been determined that acquiring encoders from any other contractor would not fulfill the technical requirements of this effort.
<p>Contractors interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the Government's requirement. In addition, the response should include any special requirements for a commercial contract (i.e., Commercial Financing, Warranty Provisions, Delivery Information, etc.) in accordance with FAR Part 12. Anticipated Award date is February 26, 2010. Responses must be received no later than (NLT) 11:00 a.m., Pacific Standard Time, February 23, 2010. Responses should be submitted via: e-mail timothy.palen@edwards.af.mil and zachary.bawden@edwards.af.mil or by faxing, Fax #: 661-277-0470 (please call and verify that we have received the fax). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Advance Notice for the<BR>Unmanned Aircraft System Technology Forum<BR><BR>1.  This is a special notice to industry inviting attendance to the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology Forum (UAS-TF).  The Government seeks involvement of industry in capturing potential improvement technology for unmanned aircraft systems, either ground sub-systems or air vehicles, including payloads.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this invitation nor to pay for participation.<BR><BR>2.  The US Army Unmanned Aircraft System Project Office (UAS PO) is inviting AUVSI Pathfinder Symposium industry attendees and other interested industry participants to schedule one-on-one UAS-TF appointments to make brief presentations about technologies related to future payloads, sense and avoid, ground systems and air vehicles.  The industry technology presented is required to be at least a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 and a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 5.  Verbal commitment must be in place that the TRL / MRL 5 exist before scheduling can take place.  <BR><BR>Summarizing the guidance found in Chapter 10 of the Department of Defense 2006 Defense Acquisition Guidebook, TRL 5 is defined as component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment with basic technological components integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so it can be tested in a simulated environment.  Examples include high fidelity laboratory integration of components.<BR><BR>Summarizing the guidance found in Chapter 4 of the Defense Acquisition Guidebook, MRL 5 is defined as capability to produce prototype components in a production relevant environment.  Manufacturing strategy is refined and integrated with the Risk Management Plan.  Identification of enabling/critical technologies and components is complete.  Prototype materials, tooling and test equipment, as well as personnel skills have been demonstrated on components in a production-relevant environment, but many manufacturing processes and procedures are still in development.<BR><BR>3.  The intent of the government is to identify technology improvements or new technologies that are at TRL / MRL 5.  This technology improvement may be implemented, in whole or in part, in UAS individual projects according to specific requirements and objectives, but the UAS-TF is not involved with any specific implementation of these technologies.<BR><BR>4.  This special notice seeks to identify interested parties who wish to present new or improved technologies to the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Project Office.  All material presented or discussed must be unclassified.  The UAS-TF and its consultative body includes, or may include, Government individuals from the Architecture and Technology Branch of the UAS PO, and subject matter experts from the UAS PO that pertain to the subject matter presented.  No SETA or Contractors will be present; therefore, no NDAs should be necessary.  The Government shall have in place sufficient physical accommodations so that proprietary material may be shown to the Government at the option of the TF presenters.  The UAS PO Security Officers and Legal professionals will be present.  Details related to ongoing or possible future acquisition activities or plans within DoD or any of the Services will not be discussed.<BR><BR>5.  To further facilitate communications and input from interested parties, UAS-TF will be held 18 March 2010, 0800-1600 at the AUVSI Pathfinder Symposium at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL.  The Government will provide a closed session with the Architecture and Technology Lead and other subject matter experts within the UAS Project Office.  Industry is invited to present to this Technology Forum in a 15 minute appointed block of time.  The Government will provide a projector and power outlets.  Presenting company must provide a laptop if deemed appropriate for the presentation.  Government requests five hardcopies of the presentation, which will be closely held and protected at the conclusion of the brief.  Presentations must contain presenters names and contact info to include email addresses and phone numbers.  Interested parties wishing to participate in UAS-TF should register on or before 8 March 2010 by emailing Jennifer.perritt@us.army.mil.  Please follow email requests with a phone call to Jennifer Perritt at 256 876 5515 to ensure that your contact info and description of technology to be presented has been received.  Appointments are received on a first come, first served basis by receipt of email.  It is also requested that you complete and return the attached Sensor Survey prior to the Technology Forum.  Please see attached.<BR>

The modification added approximately 2120 townships to be processed in the same manner as the original 2874 townships identified on the order.  Funding in the amount of $273,067.42 has been obligated to fund the additional work.
Issuing this modification is in the best interest of the government.  Premier Data Services was awarded a previously completed BPA for this type of work.  Instead of issuing a new order to Premier Data Services, which we would have done since they are the sole awardee of the BPA, we have elected to modify the existing order to incorporate the additional work.

<CONTACT>Edward A. Langwinski, Contracting Officer, Phone 2564501412, Email edward.langwinski@mda.mil
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency is continuing to seek sources and solutions to enhance its current suite of modeling and simulation (M&S) frameworks.  The current frameworks (the Digital Simulation Architecture [DSA] and the Single Stimulation Framework [SSF]) integrate models from each of the BMDS program elements into a system that accurately represents the performance of fielded BMDS equipment against a variety of threats in realistic environments.  A desired future framework, hereafter called Objective Simulation Framework, will leverage existing or mature capabilities, develop common interfaces, or propose a combination of both, to join digital and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) representations into a modular, scalable, reconfigurable, and compose-able system.

MDA will conduct Industry Days during the 3rd Quarter, FY10 at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, AL to exchange information with interested parties regarding the Objective Simulation Framework (OSF) and improve the understanding of the Government requirements and industry capabilities.  As part of the Industry Days, potential offerors will have an opportunity to meet with the Government in one-on-one meetings to discuss the OSF.

Interested parties who would like to attend the Industry Days must complete the attached OSF Industry Day Registration Form and return it to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Edward Langwinski, edward.langwinski@mda.mil, no later than 26 March 2010.  All future notices and information regarding the Industry Days, to include scheduling, shall only be provided to those who submit an OSF Industry Day Registration Form.

In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, the Government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of this Special Notice, to include costs associated with attending the Industry Days.  This Special Notice is NOT a commitment that the Government will definitely award an OSF contract.

Submit all responses/inquiries to Mr. Edward Langwinski, Contracting Officer, 256-450-1412, edward.langwinski@mda.mil.

<DESC>Opportunity:  Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), operated by Sandia Corporation under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, is seeking an industrial partner or partners to commercialize SNL's thin-film thermal battery technology and to jointly participate in the development and scale up of the technology to industrial levels, optimize final design and manufacturing parameters, and provide manufactured prototypes for test and evaluation.
<p>SNL has developed a thin-film coating approach as an alternative to conventional powder processing techniques employing pellet presses in the manufacture of thermal batteries.  The approach developed is applicable to low-cost manufacturing of thermal batteries for the DOD and DOE/NNSA market and has a number of technical advantages over conventional approaches.   In addition to the coating technology, SNL is investigating alternative approaches to insulation and packaging that further reduce cost, weight, and volume.  It is anticipated that this alternative manufacturing approach, when commercialized, will lead to reduced manufacturing costs and alternative designs that offer higher performance and increased flexibility for DOD and DOE/NNSA customers.</p>
<p>Sandia is seeking partnerships with one or more industrial partners with proven experience in thermal battery manufacturing.  Partners will collaborate with Sandia on the continued development and testing of the thin-film thermal battery, and provide a clear path to commercialization through refined product design, optimization for manufacturing, Quality Assurance, and related commercialization issues.  Qualified partners will contribute resources, including staff and facilities toward this collaboration, and will be expected to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), and license Sandia's intellectual property.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the collaboration, partners will offer products for sale using the approach to DOD and DOE/NNSA markets that may result from federal procurements.</p>
<p>Companies interested in partnering with us on thin-film thermal batteries should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following: 1. Company name and address; 2. The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact; 3. A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology, in response to the description provided above.<br />For more business and licensing information, please contact Laura E Santos, ph (925) 294-1214, fax (925) 294-1339, email:  lesanto@sandia.gov.</p>
<p>Please respond by email or fax no later than March 23, 2010, at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 9290, P.O. Box 929, Livermore, California 94551</p>
<p>Sandia is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.</p>

<DESC>SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic has awarded contract N65236-10-C-5196 in the amount of$410,400.00 to Rohde & Schwarz, 302 Sentinel Drive, Suite 105, AnnapolisJunction, MD 20701-1052 on 18 February 2010. The purpose of this contract is toprovide one HF-System (2x 1kW HF-Tx/Rx + 1x VLF-HF-Rx), Up-grade NSC. Inaddition to the above the required Rohde & Schwarz HF equipment can bemonitored and operated by means of an RS-422 interface. The basebandcommunications switch contains software that was specifically written tointerface with the required Rohde & Schwarz HF equipment over the RS-422interface. No other manufacturer's equipment can interface with the existingbaseband switch. The only current manufacturer of single channel HF narrowbandequipment is Rohde & Schwarz. The customer cannot support wideband HF equipmentas there is no physical space to install wideband antennas. Wideband HFantennas take up much more space than narrowband HF antennas. The HF equipmentalso supports Automated Link Establishment (ALE) and can operate on Link 11,both of which are the customers operational requirements. All documentation,training programs and support structure and mechanism is tailored around theRohde & Schwarz HF equipment. Any other equipment would require a totaloverhaul of the entire support, training and documentation program for thecustomer. This would incur significant monetary and time costs and could delayoperational abilities. Comments can be submitted in writing to John R.O'Connor, Code 2.2.5.5JO, john.r.oconnor@navy.mil, prior to 2:00 p.m. EST on 25February 2010.

Evidence shall be provided listing customers that acquired an identical system in no more than 20 weeks.<BR><BR>Warranty:  18 months<BR><BR>Justification:<BR>Current X-ray imaging systems used in the ballistic range area are single pulsed, one image per film plane systems. There is need for a high speed framing x-ray system to view multiple images from one location. The requirement for this system is to produce multiple x-ray images on a single digital large format screen. For example multiple data points are needed to determine maximum deflection in protective clothing and helmets. If this data were not available, testing and ultimately safety releases on new helmet and body protection materials would be delayed in trying to determine maximum deformation due to threat impacts. This data correlates directly to blunt trauma injuries. Examples in ballistic testing involve threat and counter measure interaction. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of this interaction is required to determine effectiveness of countermeasure techniques. Without x-rays penetration characteristics and multiple data points to view the interaction, multiple testing and longer test schedules would be required to develop and determine effectiveness of these techniques.<BR><BR>NOTES to Offerors:  Offers shall submit system schematics and capabilities in the quote for evaluation. This procurement will be made for the lowest price technically acceptable quote.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.  

Solicitation number #XW001-XW997 is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).  As a result of this solicitation, GSA anticipates award of a fixed-price purchase order for all but elements 5 and 8 of the statement of work below.  These tasks will likely be awarded on a time-and-materials basis.  This acquisition is a total set-aside for small businesses.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 Environmental Consulting Services and the applicable size standard is $7 million.

Executive Order (EO) 13514 requires every agency to develop greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets for both their direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2 and 3) emissions.  Partnering with DOE and EPA, GSA intends to lead the Federal Government’s development of training and assessment teams that will assist the agencies in establishing GHG reduction targets and establishing implementation plans. These teams will act as “force multipliers” across GSA, EPA, OPM, Treasury, DOE, and will become key enablers in our compliance with the Executive Order.  

Since this task order will require emissions expertise in a number of specialized areas (buildings, transportation, other resource flows), GSA encourages the use of subcontractors, as necessary, in order to provide the best technical solution possible.  Any subcontracting performed under this task order must be performed within the limits of clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting.

Statement of Work:

GSA requires a Contractor to facilitate this effort by performing the following tasks (completion deadlines in parentheses):

1. Demonstrate thorough knowledge of Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, and EISA 07/EO 13514 by providing a summary report of these GHG requirements and a proposed agenda for meeting with agency personnel. (6 April 2010)

2. Meet with stakeholders and subject matter experts from OPM, Treasury, EPA, GSA and possibly DOE for an initial assessment. GSA will provide basic data on each agency (gross square footage, number of people, number of facilities, number of locations, size and makeup of any fleet assets, budget number and any breakdown that might be required for analysis – to be provided later). (8-21 April 2010)

3. During the assessment, identify each of the above-listed agency’s challenges and opportunities as they pertain to GHG reduction targets and implementation plans. Submit this summary in a report and along with a proposed agenda for the 2-3 day workshop (see element 5 below). (22 April 2010)

4. Provide GSA with the list of proposed attendees and dates for the workshop for approval. (23 April 2010)

5. Conduct a 2-or 3-day GHG Reduction Workshop to educate 30-50 personnel from the above-listed agencies.  The Workshop shall consist of a series of presentations on best practices and advanced techniques for reducing GHG emissions. The remaining time shall consist of working groups that mix agency personnel to devise innovative solutions to setting and meeting GHG emission reduction targets. (approx. 28 April 2010)

6. Using data and feedback collected during the agency visits and the workshop, assess the high-level costs and potential reductions from a broad spectrum of possible actions. Develop an integrated GHG reduction approach that strategically addresses all scopes of emissions. Present this approach in report format and/or software (if applicable) to each pilot agency - GSA, EPA, OPM, and Treasury. Also, the Contractor shall provide an executive summary report on significant findings, recommendations and opportunities for synergies across all agencies to the Director of the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings at GSA. (11 May 2010)

7. Provide an education plan to GSA for use in teaching GSA and other agency personnel how to: assess the challenges and opportunities within their organization, develop reasonable GHG reduction goals for their organizations, and design implementation plans to achieve the stated reduction targets. Other elements may be included in the education plan as applicable. (18 May 2010)

8. Provide ongoing consultation services (locations, timing, and duration to be determined) to OPM, Treasury, EPA, GSA, and possibly DOE, on the integrated approach, including iterative LCA and packaging of opportunities, to optimize GHG emission reductions. Suggest a suite of measures and timing for the agencies that will set the priorities for those agencies to meet their reduction targets. (beginning 18 May 2010 and ending no later than 30 September 2010)

<DESC><p><br />The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing the services to USAID/Nepal's "Ghar Ghar Ma Swathya (Healthy Homes) Program".</p>
<p>USAID/Nepal has developed a social marketing and social franchising activity which aims to increase informed awareness, demand, availability, and use of selected family planning, maternal and child health, and HIV/AIDS/STI commodities and services. This activity will enhance the capacity of a social marketing organization and contribute to strategic behavior change communication for key health issues. The Contractor will be expected to assist Contraceptive Retail &amp; Sales (CRS) to achieve self-sustainability for ongoing performance of high quality social marketing and social franchising activities in Nepal. CRS is a leading social marketing organization in Nepal. The Contractor will be required to provide technical assistance to CRS through training, mentoring, product diversification, market analysis and capacity-building to assist CRS to improve their financial management, long-term planning capacities, and overall level of sustainability. <br /><br />This is a full and open competition, under which any type of organization (large or small commercial [for profit] firms, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations) is eligible to compete. USAID plans to award a Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)&nbsp;term type contract with a total estimated cost of $7 to 9.9 million covering a period of five years, subject to availability of funds. The total estimated cost range for the contract does not mean that Offerors should necessarily strive to meet the maximum amount. Offerors must propose costs that they believe are realistic and reasonable for the work.<br /><br />This solicitation in no way obligates USAID to award a contract, nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>

The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest<BR>can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors.<BR><BR>b. Nature of Work: The services necessary for each requirement will be negotiated and awarded as individual task orders.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
      Informal forum with the Ombudsman:. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
      Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractor in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFQ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each proposal<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFQ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed in the Statement of Work.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Cost - </strong>The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of the total proposed price/cost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To determine reasonableness of price/cost, the Government will review the price including the element of costs used to develop the proposed price to assess whether the offerors price proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the statement of work requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will analyze financial capabilities based upon the offeror's documentation to undertake the proposed project and other factors as outlined in FAR 9.1, Responsible Prospective Contractors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government may request additional information on financial resources and performance capability from the offeror in order to evaluate the offeror's ability to perform on the proposed contract.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center; mso-pagination: widow-orphan" align="center"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Purpose:</span></span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The purpose of this effort is to develop course design guides (also known as preliminary plans for instructional design) of training for the following:</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) inspectors for examining the safety of hydrogen systems on-board commercial vehicles and</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) drivers for awareness of the hazards of hydrogen systems on-board commercial vehicles.</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Background:</span></span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">As the result of an earlier effort prompted by the President's Hydrogen Fuel Initiative, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) in 2007 published three documents pertaining to the safety of operations and maintenance of commercial vehicles using hydrogen as an alternative fuel. These documents are as follows:</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) "Guidelines for Use of Hydrogen in Commercial Vehicles,"</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) "Changes to Consider in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and North American Standard Inspection Procedures to Accommodate Use of Hydrogen as an Alternative Fuel in Commercial Vehicles," and</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(iii) "System Safety Plan for Commercial Vehicles Using Hydrogen as an Alternative Fuel."</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">These documents are posted at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/art-public-reports.asp"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">www.fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/art-public-reports.asp</span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">As the result of funds made available by Congress in 2009 through the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), FMCSA is able to pursue follow-on effort to carry out some of the recommendations made in the above documents. The two recommendations that will be carried out in this effort are associated with training of inspectors and training of drivers.</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The "Changes to Consider in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and North American Standard Inspection Procedures to Accommodate Use of Hydrogen as an Alternative Fuel in Commercial Vehicles" document noted that the fuel system is a critical safety component and recommended Out-Of-Service criteria for removing a commercial vehicle from operation in the event of an on-board hydrogen leak. Therefore, it follows that commercial vehicle inspectors should be trained to look for hydrogen leaks. The "Guidelines for Use of Hydrogen in Commercial Vehicles" recommended that commercial drivers be given hydrogen hazard awareness training. Therefore, a statement of work is devoted to development of course design guides for commercial vehicle inspectors and drivers in hydrogen safety.</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">It is important to realize that while not all the standards have been put in place to regulate hydrogen safety on commercial vehicles, training will evolve and expand to assimilate new standards. For example, the standard having the most significant impact on the use of hydrogen as an alternative fuel in commercial vehicles is being developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). [NHTSA has jurisdiction over all vehicle manufacturers and issues the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards while FMCSA has jurisdiction over operations and maintenance of commercial vehicles and issues the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.] NHTSA is developing a standard for compressed hydrogen gas storage containers used on vehicles. Although this is an important, new standard, FMCSA anticipates that this standard will be very similar to the requirements from the current standard for compressed natural gas storage containers used on vehicles. When NHTSA issues that particular standard for hydrogen storage containers on vehicles, FMCSA will incorporate the training requirements for compliance with that standard.</span></span></p>

<DESC>If a vendor would like to submit a proposal using a spray method we would consider it provided they submit and get approval for an overspray mitigation plan to protect the inside of the hangar.  All parts of the airplane that are contained inside of Bldg 4 could be considered for spraying.  The tail would pose a challenge as it extends outside the building.  Again, IF a vendor wanted to spray that they would have to submit and get approval for an overspray mitigation plan to protect the building and other  items in the area.<BR><BR>Paint: Again our desire is to maintain as much historical accuracy for the paint scheme as possible.  Having said that, if a vendor would like to apply a flat paint and then apply a flat clear coat that would be acceptable provided they meet the color codes for the paint scheme and similar UV protection to that of a polyurethane paint. <BR><BR>Note changes to SOW in Red, Questions and Answers, Changes to Slides, TO data for C130.<BR><BR>***Contractors may submit a quote to roll and brush paint or spray or a proposal for both methods.  If a Contractor decides to spray, the Contractor must submit and get approval for an overspray mitigation plan to protect the building and other  items in the area.<BR>

H.1. 3  Security and Privacy Clause for Personally Identifiable Information

Information security and privacy, including the protection of sensitive/confidential information whether in verbal, written or electronic form, are a high priority of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Therefore, all contractors and the subcontractors, who may have access to any personally identifiable information, are subject to the rules, regulations and procedures established by the Privacy Act of 1974 (PA) and implementing regulations, as well as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

As such, all contractors and subcontractors shall only collect, maintain and use  sensitive/confidential, personally identifiable information as necessary within the scope of the services to be provided to the NIH. In addition, all contractor staff shall use sensitive/confidential information only in the performance of their assigned duties as related to the delivery of those services.

Information provided by the NIH may not be shared with any third-party without the express written permission of the Project and Contract Officers and may not be used for any purpose other than for the delivery of specific services to be provided to the NIH.

The unauthorized disclosure of any information protected by the PA or HIPAA may be punishable by administrative sanction or by fine and purposeful disclosure may result in criminal charges.

The contractor and subcontractors are required to submit a company security/confidentiality policy and related procedures, which are to include the requirement for a signed employee confidentiality agreement. Link to the NIH NDA http://irm.cit.nih.gov/docs/public/Nondisclosure.pdf

The Contractor shall follow the applicable verification requirements at (b)(1) or (b)(2) respectively, except that any requirement for verification of new employees applies only to new employees assigned to the contract. 
(4) Option to verify employment eligibility of all employees. The Contractor may elect to verify all existing employees hired after November 6, 1986, rather than just those employees assigned to the contract. The Contractor shall initiate verification for each existing employee working in the United States who was hired after November 6, 1986, within 180 calendar days of— 
(i) Enrollment in the E-Verify program; or 
(ii) Notification to E-Verify Operations of the Contractor’s decision to exercise this option, using the contact information provided in the E-Verify program Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).

<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33).

Therefore, to facilitate payment, it is in the contractor's best interest to ensure that the DUNS number is recorded on every invoice submitted against this contract.</p>
<p>All payments based on percentage or stage of completion rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend percentage or stage of completion payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>

Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed.

<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER EA133M-10-SU-XXXX (to be assigned upon contract award). &#61618;</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUESTS LABOR RATE (MARCH 2005)<br /><br />The Additional Item Requests (AIRs) labor rate (CLIN 0002) offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>a. The rate for all man-hours of labor, to be used for emergent work if ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the "Changes - Ship Repair" or mutually agreed upon by the parties by supplemental agreement to accomplish additional work not required elsewhere in the work items, shall be established using this labor rate. The estimated man-hours for this Dockside Availability are listed in Section B. <br /><br />b. This rate shall be a flat rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:</p>
<p>1 . Production man-hours shall be for skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in <br />direct production as exemplified by the following functions: Abrasive Cleaning/Blasting, Blacksmithing, Boilermaking, Carpentry, Crane Operation, Electrical/Electronics Work, Engineering (Production), Insulating/Lagging, Machining (inside and outside), Painting, Pipe Fitting, Rigging, Sheet-metal Work, Shipfitting, Shipwrights, Staging/Scaffolding, Tank Cleaning, and Welding/Burning/Brazing.<br /><br />2 . Non-production man-hours (whether charged as direct labor or indirect labor by the contractors accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production man-hours. Examples of support functions include: Engineering (support), Estimating, General Labor, Firewatch, Material Handling, Planning, Quality Assurance, Security (General), Supervision, Surveying, Testing, and Transportation.</p>
<p>3 . Other indirect charges including but not limited to the following: overhead, general and administrative, support functions, facilities, and capital cost of money and profit for the contractor and any subcontractors selected by the prime contractor. The hourly rate will not be used to price work which may be directed to a subcontractor by name in the work specifications.</p>
<p>c. All material costs shall be paid based on the contractor's return cost plus the markup identified in Section B (CLIN 0002). The estimated worth of additional material for this item is also listed in Section B.</p>
<p>d. The contractor shall take into account full award of estimated AIRs hours during the development of the Production Schedule. Award of any portion of this item does not in its self justify an extension to the original contract completion date.<br /><br />e. The quantities of AIRs labor hours (CLIN 0002) and additional material (CLIN 0003) indicated in Section B are only estimates and are Growth Items pursuant to this solicitation. The provided burdened man-hour rates and material cost rate shall remain in effect for the entire life of the contract. The estimated quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours/material that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule at its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusions of these items do not obligate the Government to exercise the item(s) nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

<DESC><p><br />The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing the services to USAID/Nepal's "Ghar Ghar Ma Swathya (Healthy Homes) Program".</p>
<p>USAID/Nepal has developed a social marketing and social franchising activity which aims to increase informed awareness, demand, availability, and use of selected family planning, maternal and child health, and HIV/AIDS/STI commodities and services. This activity will enhance the capacity of a social marketing organization and contribute to strategic behavior change communication for key health issues. The Contractor will be expected to assist Contraceptive Retail &amp; Sales (CRS) to achieve self-sustainability for ongoing performance of high quality social marketing and social franchising activities in Nepal. CRS is a leading social marketing organization in Nepal. The Contractor will be required to provide technical assistance to CRS through training, mentoring, product diversification, market analysis and capacity-building to assist CRS to improve their financial management, long-term planning capacities, and overall level of sustainability. <br /><br />This is a full and open competition, under which any type of organization (large or small commercial [for profit] firms, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations) is eligible to compete. <br /><br />This solicitation in no way obligates USAID to award a contract, nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.

<DESC>(U) Request for Information (RFI) on the Current State of Radar Data Processing Algorithms for the Tactical Radar Exploitation Toolkit<BR><BR>(U) THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.<BR><BR>(U) The Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is seeking information on the current state of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) sensor processing algorithms.<BR><BR>(U) The current problem that plagues the analyst community is that individual sensor packages are being developed in conjunction with exploitation stations that are specific to the sensor.  Algorithms developed for one sensor may be able to benefit another yet they are often not shared.  This current sensor specific exploitation station design makes analyzing data across multiple sensors an unwieldy task.<BR><BR>(U//FOUO) I2WD intends to acquire and/or develop the Tactical Radar Exploitation (TREX) Toolkit, a framework for a suite of automated sensor processing software, to aid in the exploitation of data from SAR and GMTI systems.  The objective of the TREX Toolkit is to provide a plug and play interface to a multitude of radar data and exploitation algorithms.  The algorithms will be implemented as interchangeable modules that can be swapped within the processing chain.  The framework will provide a means to create adapters to allow data, generated by varying sensors, to be easy ingested for display in a common format.  As part of this effort, I2WD will study TREX performance in order to determine whether results from a single algorithm are sufficient for the given task or if further information can be obtained by using a family of algorithms.<BR><BR>(U//FOUO) Respondents are requested to provide a summary algorithms used to exploit SAR and/or GMTI data including, but not limited to:<BR>Image analysis<BR>Change detection<BR>Automatic feature detection<BR>Aided target detection, classification and/or recognition<BR>Tracking/Trackers (traffic patterns or human tracking)<BR>People and wildlife discrimination<BR>Pattern recognition<BR><BR>(U//FOUO) Please consider providing some of the following information about the algorithm(s):<BR>Type of data used for ingestion, for example: raw, standardized, proprietary, etc.<BR>Type of output data generated<BR>Applicable frequency range (i.e. more applicable to low and/or high frequency systems)<BR>Required hardware or processing power needed<BR>Potential for standardizing input/output<BR>Potential for modularization<BR>Maturity<BR><BR>(U) Finally, respondents should provide information regarding any underlying software technology, middleware, and/or framework architecture that the algorithm(s) utilizes, requires or is compatible with (i.e. Matlab, Labview, Java, JBOSS, JMS, .NET, etc&).  <BR><BR>(U) The government does not intend to pay for this information.  Responses are to be received by 30 days from this post date or 18 March 2010. All information must be in writing or via e-mail.  There is a 5MB email limit. You may forward responses to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: RDER-IWR-RA (Mr. Lamanna) or the following e-mail address:  peter.lamanna@us.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  If you choose to submit proprietary information, mark it accordingly.  Classified information will be accepted by mail only, but please mark it accordingly and send it via proper channels.

The Draft PWS (para 1.4) identifies Work Location:  Work shall be performed at the Government Site. and Part 4 of the Draft PWS suggests the Place of Performance will be determined upon award of the contract.

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is conducting market research to determine the cost effectiveness of procuring a new enterprise security system at both its Washington, DC and Dallas/Ft Worth facilities. We would like your company to provide a White Paper detailing the cost of undertaking such a project. Our request for information in no way suggests we are asking you to provide a formal bid and does not contractually obligate us to your company, nor does it guarantee we will seek proposals for this effort. The information below is provided to assist you in responding to our request.
<p>- The system needs to support over 4,000 users at two locations. One location is in Texas, the other is in Washington DC<br />- BEP will provide the network ports at the respective locations for equipment connectivity.<br />- Current system includes approximately 1012 readers and 153 panels, but the proposed system needs to be scalable to support additional readers/panels.<br />- The current system includes 4200 Alarm points <br />- We need the capability for at a minimal 500 areas/partitions and 1000 control points<br />- Vendor is responsible for the configuration and integration of the proposed components.</p>
<p>Additionally, please breakdown your estimate to include individual costs for the following information in your White Paper:</p>
<p>- System design costs<br />- Software/licensing costs<br />- Reader costs<br />- Panel costs<br />- Installation costs<br />- Your system's ability to integrate with a DVRS system <br />- Your system's ability to coordinate separate campuses <br />- Whether or not your system is HSPD-12 compliant/certified through GSA<br />- Whether or not your system has a Visitor Access capability<br />- Whether or not you can create an enterprise system between the two facilities</p>
<p>We ask that you respond to our request by 26 February 2010. If you have any questions regarding our request please direct them to Jules Tchoujan, Contracting Officer, at 202-874-1182.<br /><br />NOTE: Due to inclimate weather in the Washington DC area, the deadline has been extended to Friday March 5, 2010 2 PM EST.</p>

REGISTRATION FEES WILL INCREASE AFTER FEBRUARY 25, 2010.  
VIEW THE CONFERENCE AGENDA HIGHLIGHTS BELOW.
The Annual FAA National Small Business Procurement Opportunities Training Conference and Trade Show will be hosted, June 28 - July 1, 2010, at the Renaissance Oklahoma City Convention Center Hotel.  The forum will provide small businesses knowledge on how to contract with the FAA, marketing strategies, and give important information on procurement opportunities such as NextGen, Systems Engineering 2020, Electronic FAA Accelerated and Simplified Tasks (eFAST), Information Technologies Support Services (ITSS), En Route Automation Modernization System (ERAM), National Airspace System (NAS) Implementation Support Contract (NISC), Mentor-Protg Program, power systems, terminal field operational support, engineering development services, safety and operations support, communications flight service and weather engineering, technology transfer, airport and aircraft safety R&D, quality standards,  research partnerships, operational support, security guard services (Federal Protective Service contracts consolidation), construction, airport modernization,  information technology support services, management services, technical support services, engineering services, facilities infrastructure and security services, environmental services, telecommunications services, major system and subsystem manufacturing, architectural and training services etc.
The FAA annually obligates more than $3.5 billion in goods and services (over $1 billion a year in support services awarded to small businesses.)  In Fiscal Year 2009, the FAA awarded 29% of the total procurement dollars to small businesses, 9% to 8(a) certified firms, 12% to small disadvantaged businesses, 5% to women-owned businesses and 2% to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  In Fiscal Year 2010 (for the period beginning 10/1/09 - 1/27/10), the FAA awarded 30% to small businesses, 11% to small disadvantaged businesses, 6% to women-owned businesses, and 3% to service-disabled veteran-owned businesses.
The FAA continues to aggressively reach out to the nation's small businesses by conducting technical panel sessions and procurement opportunity workshops that are specifically focused on awarding prime contracts and subcontracts to small businesses.  Workshop sessions will address technical program requirements and business issues as well as provide detailed procurement information that will help increase small business opportunities with the FAA.
Small businesses are encouraged to market their capabilities during the forums with large primes, FAA technical and procurement subject matter experts, and by participating in the Exhibit Hall Trade Show.  Large businesses with major FAA contracts will also be on-hand to provide specific subcontracting opportunities and conduct industry subcontracting/mentor-protg workshops (i.e., SRA International, Computer Sciences Corporation, Serco, Northrop Grumman, Deloitte and Touche LLP, Apptis Inc., A3 Technology, Harris, ITT, Tremco Inc., Advanced Management Technology Inc., Lockheed Martin, Parsons, L-3 Communications, Raytheon, B3 Solutions, VMD Systems Integrators, Inc., Construction and Service Solutions Corp. and many more.)

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS codes 31-33 Manufacturing; 51 Information; 54 Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services; 81 Other Services, that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge in the area of talent management products and services.</p>
<p>The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program at the U.S. Department of Commerce's (DoC) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland is a nationwide network of centers and resources transforming manufacturers to compete globally, supporting greater supply chain integration, and providing access to technology for improved productivity. MEP centers work directly with small manufacturers to provide expertise and services tailored to their most critical needs, which range from process improvements and worker training to business practices and applications of new technology. Solutions are offered through a combination of direct assistance from center staff and outside consultants.</p>
<p>The MEP system of centers and field offices in all fifty states and Puerto Rico is funded by federal, state, local and private resources to provide these services to manufacturers. As part of MEP's "next generation" strategy, the Program Development Office of MEP is researching, developing and testing new tools and methodologies regarding talent management, which will be utilized to implement new product and service offerings delivered through, and in partnership with, the national network of MEP Centers to small and medium size manufacturers. The goal of this effort is to ensure that small and medium size manufacturers have the appropriately skilled workforce in the quantity that they need to succeed and thrive in the new global economy, and to complement and supplement, rather than replace or compete with, existing public sector offerings around workforce and talent development.</p>
<p>NIST MEP seeks information on potential sources with demonstrated tools and methodologies in the following areas:</p>
<p>1) Talent management and workforce planning including leadership, culture, and the life cycle of talent within the organization.<br />2) Skills analysis including intra-firm analysis of incumbent worker knowledge, skills, and abilities and subsequent gap analysis on knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to transform the firm into new product lines, markets, and customers.<br />3) Training and development planning to help firms analyze cost-benefit of different approaches, techniques, and investment returns regarding training choices.<br />4) Benchmarking human capital practices to maximize return on investment.<br />5) Career Ladder identification and analysis both into and out from different occupations, and both within and across divisions and units.</p>
<p>Additionally NIST seeks familiarity with MEP's "next generation" strategy with its increased focus on workforce development; and knowledge of manufacturing extension programs and their relationships to talent and workforce development programs, practices, and projects.</p>
<p>Small businesses that currently possess such capabilities and have prior experience providing services using this expertise are encouraged to respond to this notice by providing the following information:</p>
<p>1. Narrative providing evidence of expertise in the above areas. The narrative should include: (1) description of product and services that align with the four elements noted above; and (2) descriptions of similar projects worked on by your company as a prime contractor or as a significant subcontractor within the past five (5) years, including: (a) dollar amount of the contract; (b) detailed description of the technical AND schedule requirements of that project; (c) a copy of sample reports completed under that project (if releasable to NIST); (d) contract type used on that project (e.g., firm-fixed-price, labor-hour, time-and-materials, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, etc.); (e) indication of how long the project took/will take to complete from start to finish, and (f) name, address, point of contact, phone number and email address at customer organization for which the work was/is being done. <br />&bull; Alternatively, if the product is still in the research and development phase, you may supplement a, b, d, and f with: (g) description of the product in development; and (h) timeline for completion of the project, within the next six months. You must still provide (c) and (e) along with this alternative. For this alternative you may substitute a mock sample report in lieu of a completed project report for (c) and you should include project completion estimates for (e). <br />2. Narrative detailing how your product/service fits into an overall talent management approach and the differential value it provides relative to similar product and service offerings in the marketplace. <br />3. Current socioeconomic status of your company including the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code. Please also indicate whether your company is currently certified as an 8(a) small business, a hubzone small business or a service-disabled veteran-owned small business for the aforementioned NAICS code. <br />4. Indication of whether your company has its own General Services Administration (GSA) Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services (MOBIS) Schedule 874 contract that currently includes Special Identification No. (874-1) and, if so, what the contract number is for that contract and the range of labor categories and current fully burdened hourly rates for each labor category under that contract. <br />5.

<p>8. This amendment will delete the " Small Business Sub-contracting plan" section of Volume 1 of the Specifications.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Question:</strong>In Section 00120 - Supplementary Instructions to Bidders, it mentions that there are Geotechnical Reports available. Nevertheless, after reviewing the documents available online it seems they have not been made available. Where can we obtain these reports?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer:</strong> The soil investigation reports are included electronically for information only via this amendment.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Question: </strong>Standard Form 1442, requires for us to provide a "Contract No." &amp; a "Requisition/Purchase Request No." We have not been able to find these numbers in the documents that are available. Could you please provide us those numbers to fill out the form?</p>

Please clarify what is the intent of the Government and how will this issue be solved.&nbsp; What should we consider in our proposal?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer:</strong> Special piping will not be required. A 6" pipe will be acceptable. All of the piping and conduit was designed using standard imperial sizes that were then converted to metric units.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So the imperial equivalent is acceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Question: </strong>In relation to the above referenced project, Section 00120 (Supplementary Instruction to Bidders section 2 states that the geotechnical reports on section 2.01 would be provided on a CD with the specifications and drawings. We have not found these reports on the downloaded files. How can we access these reports?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer:</strong> The reports are provided for information only via this amendment.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Question:</strong> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Section 31-2000-2 states:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the course of the site preparation and earthwork activities, fill will be required to raise site grades, backfill around pile caps, behind walls, excavations, utility trenches, and landscaping areas. The Contractor shall use the different types of materials specified herein as directed by the Contracting Officer and Geotechnical Engineer. The Contractor shall provide, at time of bid, unit prices for the imported materials. Supplementary Form 1442 does not provide a Space for this unit price. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Can we write it in without invalidating our bid?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer: </strong>Unit prices are not required. The Contractor shall include all costs in their bid. The contractor shall ignore all references to unit prices in the specifications.</p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Question: </strong>Drawing AS 1(Architectural Site Plan) shows a new Anti ramp fence from north to south adjacent to the existing Federico Degetau Bldg. The same fence is shown "existing to remain" on Drawing CS 101A (Civil Site Plan). Please clarify extent of anti ramp wall in this area.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer:</strong> For the base contract, the existing fence is to remain as shown on CS101A. For the option a new anti-ram fence as shown on CS101B is required.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Question:</strong>In section 00120 - Supplementary Instructions to Bidders Section 4.02 reference is made for ORCA registration which we have done.

<DESC>RECOVERY - This notice is to publicize the exercising of Option 1 (CLIN 0002)on Contract SB1341-09-CN-0099 (Acceleration of Smart Grid Interoperability Standards and Harmonization) with the EnerNex Corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the requirements of FAR Subpart 5.705, publicizing post award, the required services for this option period are for the contractor to provide services to accelerate Smart Grid (SG) interoperability standards and harmonization under Title XIII, Section 1305 of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) under the Department of Commerce (DOC) has primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of SG devices and systems. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided funding through the Department of Energy to implement Section 1301 of EISA. NIST intends to use a portion of these funds to accelerate the development of the interoperability framework and model standards. This modification M006 to Contract SB1341-09-CN-0099 with EnerNex Corporation represents a portion of that effort. This is a time and materials contract and was awarded through full and open competition.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>N40442-09-C-2012
<MODNBR>P00001
<DESC>The USS EMORY S. LAND conducted a Dry-docking Planned Maintenance Availability (DPMA) at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard from October 2008 through September 2009.  The overhaul and alignment of the ship’s propulsion shafting was accomplished during this DPMA, however the waterborne verification of the shafting alignment was deferred for accomplishment during an MSFSC executed Post Shipyard Availability (PSA). MSFSC awarded the PSA contract via a competitive solicitation to Cascade General with the repairs being accomplished at the Kitsap Naval Station.  The PSA award was made in the amount of $9,591,503 with a total evaluated price of $11,174,702 inclusive of options, and a period of performance of 19 October 2009 for 150 days.  Work item 203 of the PSA package addressed the requisite waterborne shaft alignment verification. 

Cascade accomplished the requirements of work item 203 and found the shaft alignment to be significantly out of specification.  These findings were subsequently verified by MSC N7 Engineering.  In order to correct the alignment to comply with the design specification requires the ship be brought to an industrial facility and dry docked.

The USS Emory S. Land must complete all industrial repair work by 28 April 2010 to support deployment preparations in order to sail on 17 May 2010 and arrive on station as per schedule.  The current PSA is scheduled to end on 16 March 2010, but is expected to be delayed until 28 April 2010 due to Government contracted repairs to the ship’s High Pressure turbine. By modifying contract N40442-09-C-2012 for the dry docking and shaft alignment correction, the agency will be able to have the ship moved to Cascade's dry-dock to accomplish the shaft alignment and at the same time be able to work the remaining items to complete the PSA with no impact to the 28 April 2010 completion date. To the extent that this work was competed and another yard was the successful offeror, it would require that the current PSA be completed prior to the tow to this other yard's facility for the dry-docking and shaft alignment work.  Such a scenario would extend the estimated completion date from approximately 28 April 2010 to approximately 10 June 2010 and thus make it impossible for the ship to be on station as scheduled.  It is critical that the ship meet its schedule due to the need to provide repair and maintenance support to Navy submarines.  Based on the above, Cascade General is the only shipyard that can provide this work within the available time period.

<DESC>The Us Army Medical command for Fort Gordon has a requirement for Singleplace Dust Extraction Smartair Plus. The Government intends to award a contract for this requirement. The suggested contractor is KaVo Dental Corporation.The purpose of this acquisition is to replace worn out suction units on laboratory benches.

The Army Dental Lab is the only dental laboratory providing support to 147 dental clinics and approximately 20 treatment facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan. The estimated contract value is 24,901.80. It is not economically feasible to purchase anohter type of workbench when so much money has been invested into current system. The KaVo workbenches can only use KaVo parts. Workbenches are not interchangeable.
