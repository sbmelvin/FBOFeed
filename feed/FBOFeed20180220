<DESC>Synopsis for the PA191/PA154/PA157 Mortar Metal Containers
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ) located at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 on behalf of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems has a requirement for the production and delivery of PA191/PA157/PA154 Mortar Metal Containers that support the 60mm/81mm/120mm Mortar Cartridges, respectively.</p>
<p>The PA191/PA157/PA154 Mortar Metal Containers are gasket sealed rectangular cans that serve as the outer pack for the 60mm/81mm/120mm Mortar Cartridges, respectively. The PA191 Metal Container supports the 60MM smoke and Illum Mortar Cartridges M722A1/M721/M767. The PA157 Metal Container supports the 81mm Smoke and Illum Mortar Cartridges M819/M853A1/M816. The PA154 Mortar Metal Container supports the 120mm Smoke and Illum Mortar Cartridges M929/M930/M983. Additionally, the PA191 holds eight (8) 60MM Mortar Cartridges, the PA157 holds three (3) 81MM Mortar Cartridges and the PA154 holds two (2) 120 Mortar Cartridges. The Metal Container manufacturing process consists of multiple operations beginning with the stamping out of the body and cover panels from the sheets of steel and the basic shapes for the formed items (body rib, hasp, latch, gasket and latch retainers) utilizing presses and dies to perform the specific operations. The next steps include, but are not limited to, the Latch Link formation, Seam-Welding the Body panels together, Spot-Welding the formed (hasps, rib, latch link retainer, etc.) items onto the Body/Cover, attaching the Latch to the Latch link, Retainer, gasket insertion, attaching the cover to the body, and lastly performing 100% Leak Testing and Palletization.</p>
<p>The United States Government (USG) intends to satisfy the requirement by soliciting for offerors through Full and Open Competition (F&amp;O) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.1 Full and Open Competition through the use of competitive proposals. The USG will evaluate offeror(s) proposals using a Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Process approach. Offeror(s) will be rated LPTA when best value is expected to result from selection of a technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluation price. Offerors will be afforded the opportunity to submit proposals for either one (1), two (2) or all three (3) of the container types. Each proposal will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>The USG anticipates awarding up to two (2) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quanitity (IDIQ) Delivery Order Contracts with five (5) one (1) year ordering periods for FY19 through FY23 requirements. The maximum estimated ceiling value of this contract will be $5.9M.</p>
<p>The Mortar Metal Containers will be manufactured, inspected, staged (assembling of the material and preparation for transit) and delivered in accordance with a Government Technical Data Package (TDP) and applicable contract requirements. Specifications and drawings, containing distribution markings will require contractors to sign and submit Military Critical Technical Data Agreements (DD Form 2345), Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA), and an AMSTA-AR 1350 prior to receiving access to the TDP.</p>
<p>The estimated timeframe of the Request for Proposal (RFP) is April 2018. All interested businesses are advised to monitor Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) for RFP release.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for the acquisition and production for the Mortar Metal Containers for the 60mm/81mm/120mm Mortar Cartridges. It is issued for notification purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>Point of contact for this requirement is Michael Anthony ACC-NJ Bldg. 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. Email: michael.j.anthony40.civ@mail.mil</p>

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Synopsis of Proposed Contract Action: Standard Army Ammunition System-Modernization (SAAS-MOD)
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island intends to solicit and award to Logistics Solutions Group, Inc. six one-month options on a sole-source basis on the Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract W15P7T-14-C-E008 in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, for continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.

<p>The proposed additional options will allow continuance of the SAAS-MOD services to complete the source selection process without risk to the schedule. The total period of performance is 16 March 201 through 15 September 2018.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis, which the Government shall consider.

<DESC>The mission of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is to make strategic, early&nbsp;investments in science and technology that will have long-term positive impact on our nation's&nbsp;national security. As part of this mission, DARPA makes high-risk, high-reward investments in science and technology that have the potential to disrupt current understanding and/or approaches. The pace of discovery in both science and technology is accelerating worldwide, resulting in new fields of study and the identification of scientific areas ripe for disruption. While DARPA's existing investment strategy continues to yield success, in order to capitalize on these new opportunities, its approach to investing must include faster responses with more small, targeted investments. This new approach is called Disruptioneering. Disruptioneering will enable DARPA to initiate a new investment in less than 90 days from idea inception.<br /><br />
<p>To enable this approach, the Defense Sciences Office (DSO) will issue Disruption Opportunities (DO) via targeted Special Notices (SN). These Special Notices will focus on technical domains important to DSO's mission pursuing innovative research concepts that explore Frontiers in Math, Computation and Design; Limits of Sensing and Sensors; Complex Social Systems; and Anticipating Surprise. More information about DSO's technical domains and research topics of interest may be found at http://www.darpa.mil/about-us/offices/dso.</p>
<p>Disruption Opportunities will be announced via Special Notices issued under this Program Announcement (PA), DARPA-PA-18-01. These DO Special Notices will solicit proposals and will be open for at least 30 days from publication at https://www.fbo.gov/. DOs will describe rapid projects addressing two phases as described below. During these periods of performance, very high-risk, high-reward topics will be investigated with the goal of determining feasibility and clarifying whether the area is ready for increased investment. The ultimate goal of each DO is to invest in research that leads to prototype development that may result in new game-changing technologies for U.S. national security. Proposals submitted in response to DOs will be evaluated and selected in accordance with Section 6 of this solicitation.</p>

A/E REGULATIONS ASBESTOS ABATEMENT
The A/E shall hire a Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) Consultant to assist in the assessment and design for asbestos abatement.
The CIH shall meet the following minimum qualifications:
Be certified by the American Board of Industrial Hygienists in Industrial Hygiene-Comprehensive.
Have asbestos abatement experience in assessment, design, abatement, construction monitoring and decontamination clearance.
His office to be as close as possible to the project location, so that he will be available to the COTR during construction on an on-call basis with a response time of one day.
Will have support staff and back-up capacity to provide adequate level of support to the COTR throughout construction.
The scope of work for the A/E with his CIH consultant is as follows:
Preliminary (25%) Design
Task 1:  Review building records and interview station personnel for detection of trade name material used for the construction of the buildings, which are known to contain asbestos.  Perform a visual inspection of the areas impacted and develop a sampling strategy that will yield statistically viable conclusions on extent of asbestos present.  Perform this task at the first preliminary submittal and notify VA on results at 100% submission.
Final (75 and 100% Reviews) Design
Task 2:  Collect bulk suspected asbestos samples and utilize the services of a testing lab accredited by the American Industrial Hygienists Association.
Upon receiving the results determine adequacy for an assessment report.  Any samples requiring further clarification, utilizing scanning electron microscopy (SEM), need to be contracted to a qualified laboratory for sample analysis.  If additional samples are required, take such samples at this stage so that the maximum detection of asbestos can be achieved.  This service (bulk sampling) will be at no cost.
Task 3:  Prepare an exposure assessment report on only the impacted areas of the modification project.  Include the following information:
Describe the impacted areas by sketches, room names or other means.  Show or describe the location of each sample taken, its composition and identification number.
Classify each impacted space as  Major Abatement   Minor Abatement  or  No Abatement  areas.  A  Major Abatement  area requires full protective measures (sealing off, change room, shower room, etc.), and all asbestos must be removed within the limits of the area.  A  Minor Abatement  area can be decontaminated with one or more applications of the  glove and bag  approach.  A  No Abatement  area requires no abatement work.
For each  Major Abatement  area, provide quantity and cost estimates of all asbestos within the limits of the area.  Quantities to be in linear feet of pipe and square feet of ceilings and walls.  The cost to be derived from the quantities multiplied by a unit price.
For each  Minor Abatement  area, provide the description, size and location of each element to be decontaminated and a cost estimate.
Provide summary of the square feet of floor space for all abatement areas, the total linear and square feet of asbestos to be abated, the total cost of abatement and a preliminary schedule of completion.  Include in the cost estimate any cost for decontamination.
Provide an assessment on the impact of abatement on building sub-systems such as ceilings, lights, walls, carpets, pipes and equipment.  Provide room-by-room description and estimated quantities of impacted items to be placed (number of lighting fixtures, square feet of ceiling, etc.) and a summary of these quantities.  Provide a cost estimate for all impacted items.
Provide a cover statement signed by both the A/E and the CIH consultant.  The statement shall be in accordance with the  Sample Cover Statement  provided by the VA, as part of the A/E package.
Submit the report at the 75% Design Review Submission.
Task 4:  Prepare drawings and specifications for the asbestos abatement work reflecting the assessment report.  The drawings shall be separately identified from the rest of the drawings, be 1/8  scale plans and shall provide as a minimum the following information.
For each  Major Abatement  area show the limits of sealing off, the location and quantities of asbestos material, the arrangements for auxiliary rooms, such as change room, shower room, etc., transportation to the loading platform.
For each  Minor Abatement  area show on plans the exact location type and length of pipe element to be abated by the  glove and bag  approach and any other abatement features.
Provide details, sections, notes and any other information that are necessary for complete bid documents.
Prepare project specifications by editing and modifying the VA master specifications on asbestos abatement.
Provide the drawings and specifications for the restoration of the impacted building sub-systems as an integral part of the overall project design.  Provide for replacing of removed asbestos insulation with acceptable non-asbestos insulation, replacing contaminated carpets, replacing old contaminated light fixtures and replacing partially torn down plaster ceilings.
The submittals of the working drawings for abatement shall coincide with the submittals for the working drawings of the modification project.
Provide an integrated phasing showing how the abatement and the general modification work will be executed.  Provide some reasonable cushion between each abatement phase and the following general construction phase to allow for unforeseen delays in abatement completion.
Task 5:  Assist VA to determine whether the abatement sub-contractor meets qualification requirements.  
Excluded from the scope of work (to be completed by others):
Provide onsite continuous monitoring during construction of the performance of the abatement sub-contractor.  Check and approve the set-up for each  Major Abatement  area, check the standard operating procedure of the abatement contractor, continuously monitor air contamination inspections to ensure compliance with specifications and drawings, and monitor access/egress into containment areas. Determine abatement of asbestos discovered during construction and advise the COTR on time and cost for such abatement.
Perform the final inspection and testing at the end of the abatement work on the area and if the results are satisfactory, release the space to the general contractor for general work.
At the end of all abatement work, a compliance certificate signed by both the CIH and the A/E shall be issued.  The compliance certificate shall be in accordance with the  Sample Certificate  provided by the VA in the A/E package.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a SPP agreement, ACT agreement, or CRADA agreement.
<p>THE TECHNOLOGY: US Patent 8,425,654 is available for licensing. Radioactive gadolinium-153 is used in devices for the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders, cardiac blockages or abnormalities, and primary and metastasized cancer tumors; and in industrial applications to measure the strength and integrity of structural materials and piping systems. To purify Gd-153 for use requires extensive chemical processing whose products-mercury and hydrogen gas-present unacceptable hazards not permitted in the radiological hot cell processing environment. To eliminate the generation of these elements, researchers at DOE's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory altered the traditional reduction procedure by using methanol as the process solvent. Its use avoids the presence of water and hydrated protons in the working solution, which can oxidize Eu2+ and cause hydrogen gas production. The process uses neutron irradiation of natural europium targets to produce Gd-153, along with a much larger amount of radioactive europium isotopes. The Gd-153 product is separated from radioactive europium by reducing the europium, then precipitating it as sulfate. The gadolinium remains in solution. After most of the europium has been removed by precipitation, the Gd-153 product is cleaned up using ion exchange. The end-product is high-purity Gd-153, free of other rare earths and other radionuclides. Although the new process resembles previous processes, the reduction takes place in an organic solvent and does not generate hydrogen gas. Hence, PNNL's process is cleaner and safer than previous processes.</p>
<p>For all inquiries, please reference Battelle IPID 16715.</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than thirty (30) days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity. Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology. Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement. Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations. Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice, referencing Battelle IPID 16715.</p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Program Office (MPO) (PMA/PMW- 101) plans to increase the contract ceiling under the existing MIDS Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Multiple Award Contracts N00039-15-D-0007 with Data Link Solutions LLC (DLS) and N00039-15-D-0008 with ViaSat, Inc. (ViaSat) due to the addition of several MIDS JTRS efforts that were not planned at the inception of the current contracts and are now required.  Due to parts obsolescence, emerging warfighter demands and producibility enhancements, the Government has determined the need to update the Link 16 Waveform, integrate new technology and merge the MIDS JTRS Concurrent Multi- Netting-4 (CMN-4), F-15, F-16 and Block Upgrade 2 Block Cycle 2 (BU2_BC2) baselines into the CMN-4 terminal, hereafter referenced as the MIDS JTRS Modernization Increment 2 (MMI2) Development effort.  In addition to MIDS JTRS MMI2 Development, the Government also requires upgrade to the MIDS JTRS CMN-4 terminal, procurement of additional MIDS JTRS terminals as identified by the platforms and retrofits for the new Cryptographic Subsystem/Protected Core Processor (CSS/PCP).  The MIDS JTRS technology contains Intellectual Property (IP), with Specially Negotiated License Rights between DLS and ViaSat only, which does not allow providing the technology to third parties.

<DESC><p>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.</p>
<p>Work will primarily support the Seattle District. However, work may be required for the Portland and Walla Walla Districts.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that one (1) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be negotiated and awarded, with a three (3) year base-period and no option periods. However, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all.</p>
<p>The total monetary capacity for this contract is $5,000,000 ($5.0M) cumulative for the 3-year contract period.</p>
<p>Work will be issued by negotiated Firm Fixed-Price task orders. All task orders may be subject to availability of funds.</p>
<p>North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 - Engineering Services.</p>
<p>This announcement is open to all small business concerns. For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its annual gross receipts are $15M or less.</p>
<p>The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to where the services will be performed.</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must have a DUNS number from Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) and be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). For information in regard to opening a SAM account, see the following link for instructions: https://www.sam.gov/sam/transcript/Quick_Guide_for_Contract_Registrations_v1.7.pdf.</p>
<p>Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov or by calling (866) 606-8220.</p>
<p>At least 50 percent of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the Prime/JV.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Geotechnical services are required to support routine USACE military, IIS, and small-scale civil works project requirements.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract will be related to geotechnical investigations, analyses, and professional recommendations (design parameters) that support execution of separate design and contract activities. The work may include, but not be limited to, the exploration, geologic mapping, sampling, testing, design and analyses of embankments, foundations for structures and similar facilities, blast design, geophysical exploration, rock mechanics investigations for one or more project phases, and other services as required by the Government.</p>
<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this particular project are listed below in descending order of importance. Criteria A through E are primary criteria. Criterion F is secondary and will only be used as a &lsquo;tie-breaker' among firms that are essentially technically equal. The secondary criterion will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation.</p>
<p>PRIMARY CRITERION (A) SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE of the team demonstrated during the past five (5) years in the broad range of work required for this contract. Firms will be evaluated based on demonstrated experience with geotechnical-related services routinely required for the following, listed in decreasing order of importance:</p>
<p>&bull; Projects requiring foundations, earth retaining structures, roads, and parking areas, demonstrating subsurface investigation, laboratory testing, and design experience.<br />&bull; Foundation design, slope stability analysis, and pavement design.<br />&bull; Small scale civil works projects (i.e., levees, culverts, and channels).<br />&bull; Materials testing (i.e., soil and rock).</p>
<p>Additional Considerations:</p>
<p>&bull; Projects in which the small business team demonstrated prior project experience working together in significant prime/sub-consultant roles may be evaluated more favorably for this criterion.<br />&bull; Projects completed on a military installation demonstrating knowledge of access and permitting requirements may be evaluated more favorably for this criterion.</p>
<p>Firms will be evaluated for experience and competence. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections F, G, and H of the SF330.</p>
<p>A maximum of ten (10) projects awarded to and/or completed by the proposed Team no more than 5 years prior to submission, including joint ventures and teaming partners, shall be shown in Section F. For the 10 projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed at one site or at a single installation. An Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) is not a project. A project may contain multiple task orders or contracts if they are for multiple phases of the project at the same site or installation. Project descriptions shall clearly state the extent of work performed by the team, extent of work completed, and dates of completion.</p>
<p>If the offeror provides a specific task order as its "project," provide the base contract number(s) and the task order number(s) for reference purposes. If the offeror provides a site-specific contract as its "project," provide the contract number. If the offeror provides more than 10 example projects, only the first 10 examples will be evaluated.</p>
<p>PRIMARY CRITERION (B) PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS of a firm's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract will be evaluated by the following criteria. The education, training, professional registration, proposed job title, and overall relevant experience of key personnel will be considered. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel identified by the A-E and not the number of personnel, which is addressed under Primary Criterion D - Capacity.</p>
<p>Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their key personnel in the following disciplines:</p>
<p>&bull; Key professional disciplines are identified below by function code: <br />- Descriptions by fc correspond to "List of Disciplines (Function Codes)" in the SF330 Instructions; where a function code (fc) does not exist, the requirement is described by the Government. <br />- Identify key personnel proposed by fc in Sections E, G, and H of the SF330. <br />- List professional registrations or certifications, if applicable, for the key disciplines.</p>
<p>&bull; Submit resumes in Section E of the SF330 for each of the disciplines below, which are listed in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>(1) Project Management (SF330 function code (fc) 48; licensed or registered professional required)<br />(2) Quality Control Management (no fc; licensed or registered professional required)<br />(3) Geology (fc 30; licensed or registered professional required)<br />(4) Hydrology (fc 34; licensed or registered professional with specialty experience in hydrogeology required)<br />(5) Geotechnical Engineering (fc 27; licensed professional required)<br />(6) Structural Engineering (fc 57; licensed professional required)<br />(7) Instrumentation Engineering (no fc; licensed or registered professional required)<br />(8) Cost Engineering (fc 18; licensed professional or nationally recognized cost engineering certification required)</p>
<p>&bull; Responses must be coordinated with Part II, subpart 9, "Employees by Discipline".</p>
<p>&bull; If multiple resumes are provided for Criterion B, identify the single most highly qualified individual proposed by the Team for each key discipline for evaluation. The additional resumes for the required disciplines or for disciplines that are not listed in this criterion will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections E, G, and H of the SF330.</p>
<p>PRIMARY CRITERION (C) PAST PERFORMANCE on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, management/business relations, and compliance with performance schedules. CPARS is the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried for all firms submitting an SF330. Each project in Section F of the SF330 shall include project owner's contact information. If deemed appropriate by the Selection Board (Board), performance evaluations for significant team subcontractors will also be considered. The Board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm if none is available from CPARS. The Board will consider the relevancy of each performance evaluation on A-E services contracts to the proposed contract, including the type of work, contractor's performing office, age of the evaluation, and whether subsequent evaluations indicate a change in a firm's performance.</p>
<p>Where no recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past performance.</p>
<p>PRIMARY CRITERION (D) CAPACITY of key disciplines. The board will consider available capacity of key disciplines identified above in Criterion B of the Prime/JV and its team consultants to perform work in the required time. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H and Part II of the SF330. Function code (fc) and descriptions must correspond to "List of Disciplines (Function Codes)" in the SF330 Instructions. Where a function code does not exist, the requirement is described by the Government. Responses must be coordinated with Part II, subpart 9, "Employees by Discipline".</p>
<p>The offeror is required to provide a table summary of the number of personnel for each key discipline, with separate columns for (1) Prime/JV capacity, (2) team subconsultants capacity, and (3) total team capacity for each key discipline in Section H of the SF330. Capacity will be measured by number of personnel, not percentages or availability.</p>
<p>Each key discipline required in the response shall be shown in and coordinated with Part II of the SF330, which requires that each individual employed by the firm be identified by one function code. Part II will be evaluated to determine if the function code capacity and claimed numbers of personnel support the information in Section H.</p>
<p>PRIMARY CRITERION (E) KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY of the team. The Board will evaluate the team's familiarity with local conditions, specifically demonstrating knowledge and experience dealing with (1) state/local regulatory agencies, (2) geological features, and (3) climatic conditions. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area; therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve projects located throughout the NWS. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF330.<br />SECONDARY CRITERION (F) VOLUME OF DoD A-E CONTRACT AWARDS. Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates, and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract(s) awarded within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms, including SB and SDB. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF330.</p>
<p>4. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus three (3) copies and one (1) CD or DVD with searchable Adobe PDF files of one SF330 (08/2016 edition, unless otherwise indicated) for the Prime firm that includes all team consultants.</p>
<p>Include the firm's DUNS number and CAGE codes in the SF330, Part I, Sections B and C.</p>
<p>The SF330 shall have a total page limitation of 80 printed pages with Section H limited to fifteen (15) pages, and Part II is excluded from the 80 printed page limit. Double-sided sheets will count as two pages. Page sheets of 11 inches X 17 inches will be counted as two (2) pages if printed on one side, and four (4) pages if printed on both sides. For all SF330 sections, use no smaller than 10 pt. font.</p>

<SUBJECT>Shoalwater Dune Repair
<SOLNBR>W912DW18B0009
<RESPDATE>030618
<CONTACT>Alex R. Marcinkiewicz, Phone 206-764-6070, Email alex.r.marcinkiewicz@usace.army.mil - Bonilie Lackey, Contracting Officer, Phone 206-764-4481, Email bonilie.l.lackey@usace.army.mil
<DESC>FOR INFORMATION ONLY:<br />This Pre-Solicitation Notice is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming. All questions regarding this Pre-Solicitation notice should be submitted in writing via email to Vincent Daniels.
<p>Construction Project:<br />U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Seattle District, requires restoration of a barrier dune on Empire Spit located in Tokeland, Washington in Willapa Bay.  The dune will be restored by the hydraulic dredging of approximately 600,000 cubic yards from an established in-water borrow site (approximately 1.5 miles from the borrow site to the dune location) and placement by hydraulic pipeline. The work needs to be performed over a period of one construction season estimated between June 2018 and February of 2019. The purpose of the work is to restore the entire length of an approximately 12,500 ft. long existing dune to its authorized height of 25 ft. MLLW. The dune has been severely eroded in certain areas due to recent wave and storm activity. The dune will require shaping to meet dune cross section profile requirements. The use of a hydraulic cutterhead suction or hopper dredge is acceptable. There is not land based access to the site, therefore all heavy equipment used to shape the dune must be mobilized and demobilized to/from the site via water.</p>
<p>The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. The resulting contract will be firm-fixed-price.</p>
<p>Solicitation number W912DW18B0009 will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, www.fbo.gov, on or about 7 March 2018. The solicitation will be an Invitation for Bids (IFB). Bids will be due no sooner than 30 calendar days after actual solicitation issuance date. See the solicitation for details about bid opening. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, and the associated small business size standard is $36.5 million in average annual receipts. The solicitation is unrestricted and open to both large and small business concerns.</p>
<p>The solicitation documents for this requirement will be issued in electronic format only and will be made available online via the FBO website at www.fbo.gov under the subject solicitation number. NO CD's OR HARD COPIES WILL BE AVAILABLE. Offerors are responsible for checking for any update(s) to the Notice/Solicitation.

<p>The FBO Response Date listed elsewhere in this pre-solicitation notice is for FBO archive purposes only. It may have no relationship to the actual solicitation due date. The solicitation due date and time will be contained in the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that are issued.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE:<br />All contractors proposing on Department of Defense (DoD) solicitations must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award of a contract. The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information and capabilities to the Government. The SAM website can be accessed at www.sam.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes as the initiation of market research under FAR, Part 10, however does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This notice functions as a RFI for offeror's who can provide relevant input to assist the U.S. ARL with their mission and mitigate deficiencies within and among the team(s) implementing the technical solutions.</p>
<p>The U.S. ARL intends to implement Self Service capabilities, Cloud Adoption, Service Catalog, Enterprise Network Infrastructure Modernization, Asset Management, and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) at ARL facilities.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>ARL is currently operating computer data centers at three (3) main locations supporting approximately 3500 researchers and support staff across five (5) major sites and many distributed smaller locations processing unclassified and classified data.  These researchers are using various configurations of desktop and laptop computers in conducting research, which are connected over high-speed networks to various servers and storage systems across the distributed data centers.  The end-user computers run various operating systems, including Microsoft Windows 10, Red Hat Linux 7 (5 and 6 as well until April 2018), MAC OS, and exploring options to offer additional Linux versions such as Ubuntu.  Researchers also use a number of applications on these end-user computers, including the Microsoft Office suite, Adobe applications, MatLAB, Kaleidograph, AutoCAD, Labview, ChemDraw, EndNote, CREO, Ensight, FEKO, LS-DYNA and Multivariate Statistical Analysis (MSA).  Researchers also access hundreds of servers in data centers while conducting research, using a variety of modelling and homegrown applications and scientific visualization capabilities to generate, analyze and report data, as well as manage externally connected sensors and control hardware.  Approximately 1.3 PBs of data storage is currently being used, with an approximate 23% annual growth rate.  A small subset of researchers and systems are on logically separated networks which change over time as needs warrant.</p>
<p><br />Requirement:</p>
<p>ARL is exploring technology solutions to modernize its IT approach and enable researchers by providing a more robust and dynamic computing environment.</p>
<p>The current approach has a number of issues that the organization seeks to resolve.  There is a high variability in end-user computer types due to the different needs of researchers - some have powerful desktops with multiple Central Processing Units (CPU), a large amount of memory and storage, and Graphics Processing Units (GPU) in order to run highly-compute intensive modeling and data analysis operations.  Researchers use various non-standard applications requiring manual installation/patching/upgrades.  In the data centers, a large number of systems operate a single Operating System (OS) and supporting services that researchers access, with systems experiencing peak utilization for some periods and near-zero utilization at other periods, rendering a large amount of compute power underutilized.  Storage area networks are becoming saturated at each major site, cannot easily replicate/back up to other sites or provide scalability between sites, and cannot be easily accessed across internal organizational boundaries  The underlying network architecture, while robust, is not as flexible as needed to meet increasingly quickly changing research requirements.  It is believed that the costs of operating this traditional environment can be decreased if utilization efficiencies can be improved and the overall architecture can be simplified.</p>
<p>In consideration of a new approach, the ARL is considering a new computing/storage environment that is more flexible, able to dynamically expand and contract services, provides better services at lower costs, supports end-user self-service where possible, and permits the IT team easier management of systems, end-user clients, and applications.  The new approach needs to ensure system administration, patching/upgrading, system and data security and backups can be accomplished more easily, as well as remotely and/or automatically where possible.  The new approach should provide flexible capabilities to build and modify logical networks and their connected capabilities to quickly respond to changing research requirements. In support of this new approach, robust issue identification, change implementation and tracking/reporting capabilities are paramount.  It is believed that this new approach of utilizing cloud computing (hybrid private/public), virtualization at various levels (OS, clients, applications, and networking), and self-service capabilities are necessary to fully modernize the current IT environment and enhance services to our research community.</p>
<p><br />The U.S. ARL seeks industry input on the applicability of the below seven (7) areas being explored, their applicability to the desired end state of improving end-user customer experience and organizational efficiency, and other approaches, technologies, or best practices ARL should consider:</p>
<p>1.	Creating a "private cloud" environment that is scalable to meet mission needs as they change;<br />2.	Designing and using an environment that utilizes Virtual Machines (VM) and containers in the data center;<br />3.	Using VDI to increase end-user flexibility while easing end-user client support burdens;<br />4.	Using application virtualization or other methods to ease application management/patching burdens; <br />5.	Implementing capabilities for end-user self-service for compute/memory/storage/applications, perhaps including IT Service Catalog(s); <br />6.	Full lifecycle asset management; and<br />7.	The use of hybrid private/public cloud capabilities.</p>
<p>Special Requirements</p>
<p>Submission Guidelines: Interested industry vendors can submit a maximum of ten (10) pages of input by the response date outlining solutions, potential cost savings, skillsets that should be considered, and best practices that ARL can consider to meet the initiatives identified under the requirements section.</p>
<p>The maximum page limit should include all appendices with the organization name, address, website, and size of ownership for the organization. Documents should be submitted in Microsoft Office format or as a portable document format (".pdf") file. If proprietary or copyrighted information is submitted, please include a statement authorizing the Government to copy and use it within the Government for comparison purposes. Appropriately marked proprietary information will be properly protected by the U.S. Government. Classified information should be submitted only if it significantly clarifies or broadens the scope of technology considered.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the Army at this time, is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. Therefore it is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are due on or before 13 March 2018 by 3:00pm EST by email at Jessica.r.camunez.civ@mail.mil</p>

<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD AN INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY UMBRELLA CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.</p>
<p>This is a SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT notice posted for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY and will be used to assist the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in determining the availability of small businesses that have the capability in providing research, measurement, assessment, design, and analysis services for models and demonstration programs created or derived under the auspices of the Patient Protection &amp; Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA), other non-ACA statutes, and future health reform legislation. CMS is interested in responses to this notice from SMALL BUSINESSES ONLY (including 8(a) businesses, service-disabled veteran owned small businesses, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small businesses, women-owned small businesses, and small disadvantaged businesses).  Your size determination will be the size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition, 541720 -- Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH TO ASSIST IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY TO OBTAIN CONTRACTOR SUPPORT SERVICES TO PERFORM THE SAME OR SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTICE. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) MAY OR MAY NOT ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE SUBMISSION OF A CAPABILITY STATEMENT; ACCORDINGLY, CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.<br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is the Federal agency responsible for the operation and oversight of the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the Federal participant in State-operated Medicaid programs and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  CMS' mission is to assure health care security for the general public through the management of programs that include Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance Programs and to provide leadership in the broader health care marketplace to improve the health of all citizens.  As an effective steward of public funds, CMS is committed to strengthening and modernizing the nation's health care system by putting patient needs first, creating more flexibilities at the state and local level, and providing access to high quality care and improved health at lower costs.  To help accomplish this mission, CMS was given broader authorities through legislation to test innovative models of care delivery and payment to determine whether they can maintain or improve quality and reduce cost, are sustainable, and are feasible for broader scale application.  This work includes the development, implementation, monitoring, analysis, and rapid cycle evaluation of such models, building collaborative learning networks to disseminate best practices, developing necessary technology to support this activity, conducting rapid cycle analysis of the programs and participants, and rapid reporting of interim findings and summative findings as feasible.</p>
<p>The models and demonstrations that will be performed under this IDIQ can move from design to announcement, then to implementation in less than a year.  These models and demonstrations can be scaled without Congressional approval if programs can demonstrate cost savings while maintaining and improving quality.  The models and demonstrations are highly visible and are tightly integrated with other programs.</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF THE IDIQ</p>
<p>Under this Research, Measurement, Assessment, Design, and Analysis Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) 2 umbrella contract, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) shall award task orders (TOs) for a wide range of analytic support and technical assistance activities that support models and demonstration programs created or derived under the auspices of the Patient Protection &amp; Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA), other non-ACA statutes, and future health reform legislation. The demands of new reforms created under ACA have redefined the way CMS approaches and conducts research activities, Model Testing, and demonstrations affecting Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and uninsured populations. The role of state and private sector payers is also being redefined, as many of the new models include multiple payers working in collaboration with CMS to reform the care delivery system. The RMADA 2 IDIQ contract shall provide CMS with a robust tool to meet these needs and opportunities. The Contractor shall work with CMS on matters including but not limited to: <br />&bull;	Supporting all aspects of  model design, implementation and operations (with the exception of information technology design, application and security);<br />&bull;	Conducting programmatic technical, and environmental analyses;<br />&bull;	Assisting with application development and review of model participants / applicants;  <br />&bull;	Monitoring of model site's and participant's progress;<br />&bull;	Designing and carrying out surveys and other primary data collection activities;<br />&bull;	Obtaining and analyzing secondary data sources including data regarding Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and data from private payer sources needed to support model design, operations and evaluations;<br />&bull;	Reporting on formative and summative analyses; <br />&bull;	Providing rapid cycle evaluation feedback to CMS and/or model participants; <br />&bull;	Implementing learning systems to support accelerated learning and improvement and dissemination of promising practices; and creating summative reports of annual and final program findings.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Wm. Jennings Bryan Dorn VA Medical Center, Columbia, SC intends to negotiate a commercial (GSAM Part 570) Sole Source lease under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The award will be a 10-year, five (5) firm year, fully serviced Succeeding Lease to Woodhill Building, LLC for the Columbia Sleep Lab. The leased facility consists of 3,911 net usable square feet (NUSF) and is located at 813 Leesburg Road, Columbia, South Carolina, within one (1) mile the Medical Center. The close proximity of this location provides accessibility to Veterans for sleep studies and sleep health assessments in conjunction with other medical treatment and services at Dorn VA Medical Center.   

The current location sleep rooms have been upgraded and insulated specifically to ensure soundproofing for sleep studies. These rooms are specialty rooms which the Government has already invested money in to upgrade from a building shell. In addition, the equipment and instruments used in the Sleep Lab have recently been upgraded. If another leased location is selected, the move of the current sleep lab and equipment is estimated to cost $25K. The cost of upgrading shell space for specialty sleep rooms and wiring would also need to be considered.

A justification for other than full and open competition is prepared in support of this acquisition. 

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Applicable NAICS code is 531120.  

Inquiries will only be accepted in writing by e-mails addressed to Craig.Magee2@va.gov or by phone at 706.733.0188 ext. 1115.  Responses will be accepted no later than 4:00 PM (EST) on February 23, 2018.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">EIELSON AFB, ALASKA, RMW 2018 SOLE-SOURCE REQUIREMENT SYNOPSIS AND SOURCES SOUGHT.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">This is a former Rocky Mountain/West Coast (RMW) Bulk Fuels Program Requirement for 24,000,000 USG Turbine Fuel, Aviation (JA1), NSN 9130-00-753-5026, Delivered FOB Origin via pipeline to Eielson AFB, AK. Period of Performance is from October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019 with a 30 day carry-over period.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Due to the nature of the specific product and location, this requirement has been separated from the normal RMW annual procurement and under the authority of FAR 6.301-1, this requirement has been identified for non-competitive contract action. Petro Star Inc. (PSI) is identified as the only source that has the ability to deliver large quantities of jet fuel consistently and reliably to the remotely located Eielson AFB at all times of the year and in all weather conditions. It is DLA Energy&rsquo;s intent to enter into a contractual arrangement with PSI for this requirement.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Other interested parties may submit a capabilities statement, indicating their logistics, supply chain and assets that would be able to meet the required delivery of large quantities of jet fuel on a FOB Destination basis consistently and reliably throughout the period of performance. Interested parties should submit a capabilities statement to the POCs (Ms. Michelle Sands/Mr. Jeremy Babb) via email as soon as possible, but not later than 3:00 p.m. local Fort Belvoir, VA time on March 13, 2018. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all capabilities statements received by the indicated closing date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid.  No formal solicitation document exists at this time.  We are seeking information for market research purposes only.  The Government will not pay for any information solicited.
The VHA Network Contracting Office 6 (NCO 6) is conducting a market survey to find qualified vendors who can provide the following: 





All responses shall be submitted no later than     _23 February 2018_______________ 
All interested parties should respond, in writing via email to _Jerry.Mann@va.gov. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  In response, please include the following:  
Company/individual name
Address
Point of contact with phone number
Information describing your interest 
Indicate FSS/GSA contract number or Open Market, if applicable
Tax ID number
DUNS number
Capabilities Statement 
Company Socio-Economic SIZE (example large, small, SDVOSB, VOSB, WOSB etc.)
Proof of verification as a SDVOSB/VOSB (if applicable)

The Government anticipates this to be either a Services Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) set-aside.  If your firm/company is a SDVOSB or VOSB, the firm/company must be VERIFIED in the VIP database (see internet site: http://vip.vetbiz.gov) as prescribed under the Veterans First Contracting Program as implemented in VAAR subpart 819.70.  The Veteran Administration is mandated by Public Law 109-461 (38 USC  8127 & 8128) to give first priority to SDVOSB and VOSB concerns if there should be sufficient firms available to compete under a set aside.  If insufficient veteran owned small business responses are received to establish the basis for setting this action aside for other than large business participation, then the action will be advertised as a small business set aside or full and open competition. In this case, all interested parties responding shall be eligible to bid. 
The NAICS 423450- Medical, Dental, and Hospital Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers is applicable to this acquisition; with a size standard of 200 Employees. 
Interested firms are reminded that in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a) Prospective contractors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications at the System for Award Management (SAM) as a part of required registration in conjunction with FAR 4.1102(a) that states, Prospective contractors shall be registered in the (SAM) database prior to award of a contract or agreement. Therefore, due to time constraints, vendors must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) at http://www.sam.gov to be considered for an award.

Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for the project is: 493120</p>
<p>The small business size standard is $27.5 million.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND <br />The Division of Intramural Research (DIR) consists of 11 branches and laboratories that conduct in-house research and training in a variety of natural sciences. DIR scientists conduct studies that contribute to the understanding of the following topic areas: biological and chemical processes, the role of environmental agents in human disease and dysfunction, underlying mechanisms of environmentally-associated diseases, and intervention and prevention studies to reduce the effects of exposures to environmental agents.</p>
<p>The Division of the National Toxicology Program (DNTP) is the principal component supporting the interagency NTP that evaluates substances and agents of environmental concern for a variety of health-related effects, generally using rodent models for study. The protocols used are designed to fully characterize the toxic and carcinogenic potential of substances by exposing rats and mice through food, drinking water, inhalation, dermal contact, or other exposure routes as appropriate to various doses of the substances. The studies are conducted at various testing laboratories under contract with NIEHS. The NTP uses a variety of approaches and testing regimens to study the potential toxic effects of exposure to environmental and occupational substances. Information about the comprehensive testing strategies used to characterize the toxic potential of these substances can be found at - https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/type.</p>
<p>Research programs of this magnitude generate large volumes of data and biological specimens that require safe, secure, short-term, and long-term storage under specific environmental conditions. The materials include wet-tissue preserved or fixed in formalin; formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks; histological glass slides; frozen tissue; biological samples; kodachrome slides; digital images; paper data; electronic data; and microfiche. Depending on the type of study, the numbers and quantities of study materials generated will range from several hundred items to potentially tens of thousands.</p>

<SUBJECT>House Pricing Forecast - 25 Years by Metropolitan Statistical Area
<SOLNBR>SS-2018-H-0006

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide an on-line 25-year House Price Index forecast data by Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) for the Office of Evaluation. The subscription provides unlimited on-line access for users with passwords to the economic forecast data. The Office of Housing in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), is responsible for risk assessment of FHA-insured and HUD-assisted single- and multifamily properties. Economic data is needed to support an on-line subscription for housing price forecast economic data. This data access is needed to meet vital components of HUDs Strategic Plan with respect to a high level of accountability in the financial management of the FHA insurance programs. This data is used for modeling and predicting FHA loan performance and for computing impacts of the FHA insurance programs and the Federal budget, and for designing risk-management tools
<p>The Office of Evaluation currently uses historical data and economic forecasts from an on-line economic data subscription:<br />As the principal source of national and regional economic time series for the statutory mandate to produce an annual MMI Fund actuarial review. This provides an independent, respected, and reliable source of forecasts on house prices and interest rates for computing Liability for Loan Guarantee requirements (loss reserves);<br />As the principal source of time series data for developing internal models of FHA-insured multifamily mortgage claim and prepayment rates. These also are used in the development of Liability for Loan Guarantee calculations and budget valuations of multifamily programs;<br />For analyzing the factors affecting FHAs single-family insured mortgage default and claim rates;<br />For multifamily risk assessment tools developed in this Office for use by multifamily program office staff in headquarters and field offices; and<br />For preparing ad-hoc analyses of economic trends and for the FHA Commissioner and HUD Secretary.<br />Background</p>
<p>Apart from its involvement in single- and multifamily risk assessment and risk scoring, the Office of Evaluation is responsible for monitoring the performance of FHAs single family and multifamily programs. It prepares periodic reports to the FHA Commissioner on FHA business activities and oversees the statutorily mandated annual actuarial review of FHAs largest insurance fund. OE is also responsible for assessing the financial impact on FHAs insurance funds of new or revised programs and policies and evaluating relationships between current economic and market conditions and FHA program goals and objectives.</p>
<p>House price forecasts are a key economic driver of results from the Independent Actuarial Study of the MMI Fund. National house prices increased significantly for over half of this decade as a sustained lower level of mortgage interest rates, relaxed mortgage underwriting, and Wall Street innovations in mortgage financing increased housing demand. Since 2006, however, the housing market has experienced a house price correction.</p>
<p>There have been significant disparities among regions in both their house price appreciation and subsequent house price correction experiences. Therefore, the impact of the recent house price correction on mortgage holders and insurers portfolios depends on their geographic profile. The geographic profile of the FHA portfolio is much different than the geographic profile of the conventional mortgage portfolio since it insured relatively very few loans in states that experienced both significant house price appreciation and correction. Because FHAs geographic risk profile of loans is so much different than the national distribution of loans, using MSA-level house price forecasts in its actuarial model will lead to a more realistic evaluation of the MMI Fund.</p>
<p>Description of Services</p>
<p>On-line access to 25-year House Price Index forecast data by MSA. The subscription to provides unlimited on-line access for users with 25 passwords to the economic forecast data with the parameters described below:<br />Forecast FHFA house price index both nationally and at the metropolitan area for 30 years.<br />The forecast methodology and validation must be provided to HUD. <br />The forecast methodology for the house price series should be part of an overall economic forecast that is developed from a macroeconomic model.<br />The forecast should be available at the metropolitan area level and these sublevel forecasts should also be part of an overall macroeconomic model and not developed separately.<br />PART A:<br /><br />Provide Forecast Database, Training and Support for Economic Forecast data.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement; a market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.
<p><br />The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of industry, to include the Small Business Community: Small Business, Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), &amp; Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB). The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsible contractors. Small business, Section 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, &amp; WOSB businesses are highly encouraged to participate.</p>
<p>Should the acquisition be set-aside for the 8(a) program, 8(a) firms are reminded they need to have a bona fide office in the geographical area of consideration where the work is to be performed as determined by SBA.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the Lewisville Dam Safety Modification is to manage flood risk, but the dam is also authorized for water supply, recreation, and environmental stewardship. The dam protects over 431,000 people and $24.2 billion in capital investment downstream. It is a primary source of municipal and industrial water supply for the Dallas - Fort Worth metroplex.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking qualified, experienced and bonded capable sources for the demolition and construction work required under this project. In response to the solicitation (expected in 2nd half of 2018) the contractor will be required to provide evidence of 3 to 5 completed projects of similar size and scope. If the offeror's firm has multiple locations, then the projects should have been completed by the regional office that will be performing the work. The projects must be at least 50% complete at the time the proposal is submitted in 2018, and must have been completed within the past 5 years. At least two of the projects should be valued at over $25 million, and at least one should be valued at over $50 million. The Fort Worth District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) intends to advertise and award a Firm Fixed Price, Design-Bid-Build, Construction Project to complete the embankment work for the Lewisville Dam Safety Modifications. The Scope of Work includes:<br />Seepage management - Construction of collection systems, drilled piers and inverted filter berms will require relocation of a municipal water line and a robust dewatering system capable of functioning in expansive soils. At conservation pool elevation, measured seepage ranges from a few gallons per minute (gpm) up to 80 gpm depending on the area. Seepage increases as the pool elevation rises during storage of flood waters. Once the confining clay cap is penetrated, this dewatering system must be able to provide a safe, stable work space during construction as well as ensure the continued integrity of the earthen embankment until the collection system and inverted filter berm are fully functional. The contractor must show experience in installing and managing such systems with varying pool elevations. <br />Outlet works conduit filter - Construction of a staged filter at the downstream end of the outlet works will require constrained space work in the presence of the conduit, the stilling basin, and a non-Federal hydropower facility. Stability of the stilling basin walls must be maintained throughout construction of the filter, and downtime for water supply releases through the outlet works must be short durations (not to exceed 48 hours per week). <br />Soil stability - due to the expansive nature of the soils they will be treated with lime to aide in long term stabilization. The ability to test the borrow source and regularly make adjustments will be critical to the long term sustainability of the modifications. <br />Other work included in this contract may include construction of a berm on a portion of the upstream face of the embankment (coffer dam, incremental lifts and compaction, removal/placement of rip/rap), and crest road modification (removal of existing asphalt road, regrading, placement of geotextile infiltration barriers, incremental lifts and compaction, paving).</p>

<DESC>HQ USSOCOM SOF AT&amp;L PROGRAM EXECUTIVE OFFICE - FIXED WING / CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT EVENT
<p>EVENT FOCUSED ON STAND-OFF PRECISION GUIDED MUNITIONS CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI). This announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by USSOCOM to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses are strictly voluntary and USSOCOM is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed. All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.</p>
<p>1. TIME AND PLACE</p>
<p>This Capability Assessment Event (CAE) will be held 24-26 April 2018 in Fort Walton Beach, FL.</p>
<p>2. WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH?</p>
<p>Program Executive Office Fixed Wing (PEO-FW), in conjunction with technical experts from Government Labs, program offices, and Special Operations Forces (SOF), seeks to improve Stand-Off Precision Guided Munitions (SOPGM). The desired improvement categories are:</p>
<p>a. Selectable warhead explosive yield*<br />b. Selectable warhead shaping*<br />c. Technologies enabling GPS-denied operation<br />d. Munitions-specific data link radio with Link-16 waveform<br />e. Low cost seekers with semi-active laser</p>
<p>*PEO-FW is not interested in Height of Burst technologies as a selectable warhead effect.</p>
<p>3. WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</p>
<p>The purpose of this CAE is to inform PEO-FW of the current state and near future of technology on these topics. The information provided might potentially support future commodity procurement (i.e., not a development program), inform future requirements for development programs, support a rapid integration/demonstration event, establish a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), support Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR), establish a Rapid Innovation Fund (RIF) project request, and/or lead to USSOCOM participation in a vendor demonstration of a capability.</p>
<p>PEO-FW has particular interest in production ready systems (i.e., minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 as defined by the Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisition Guidebook (August 5, 2010) and a minimum Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 7 as defined by the DoD Manufacturing Readiness Assessment Deskbook (May 2, 2009). However, PEO-FW will also consider presentations on lower TRL and MRL capabilities. In addition, presented capabilities should require minimal-to-no hardware modifications to SOF FW aircraft and must be compatible with current SOF FW aircraft systems for any required software modifications; however, presented capabilities requiring hardware and software modifications specifically to munitions are welcomed.</p>
<p>4. HOW WILL THE CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT EVENT BE CONDUCTED?</p>
<p>The CAE will have two sessions held at the UNCLASSIFIED level.</p>
<p>1. A joint Government/Industry session where the Government will discuss: <br />a. PEO-FW overview and current capability gaps <br />b. SOF SOPGM Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and Users engagement <br />c. Additional speakers to be determined</p>
<p>2. One-on-one meetings between the Government team members and selected individual Industry partners to discuss Industry's perspective on the benefits, opportunities, and challenges of implementing SOPGM solutions. Each one-on-one session will be approximately 45 minutes in length.</p>
<p>5. IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED FOR ATTENDANCE:<br />&bull; Vendors wishing to participate are limited to two capabilities for presentation.<br />&bull; Participants should complete a quad chart and a white paper -up to two pages- for each capability; a quad chart example can be found on the submission page <br />&bull; Participants should submit their completed quad charts/white papers to: https://www.vulcan-sof.com/RFI/6453227f-e177-4ce5-9cea-367f0687ca8d<br />&bull; The Government team will review the quad charts/white papers and select up to 12 attendees for the Government/Industry session and the one-on-one meetings.<br />&bull; SOFWERX will send invitations with additional directions to the selected participants NLT 6 April 2018.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions to Ms. Tara Parker, Tara.Parker@sofwerx.org or Mr. Destin Fleming, Destin.Fleming.ctr@socom.mil</p>

<DESC>Repair and Modifications of Boilers 1&2 
at the
Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC)
Cheyenne, Wyoming 82001

Brief Scope of Work
(This is for information only)

General:  

PLEASE NOTE: This is not routine boiler repair/replacement of boiler parts and/or service. Our VA Boilers have been written up for non-compliance by the State Boiler Inspector. Before the piping can be certified with an  R  stamp, a  Historical Traveler  document must be created to document all previous repairs and modifications. This work can be done only by industry specialist in Boiler Safety, modification and historical tracking to ensure that previous repairs and certification(s) of repairs are authenticated. If you feel your company can perform/complete this requirement please continue with RFI and respond accordingly. 
The purpose of this Scope of Work is to Repair, Modify, Inspect 2 Clever Brooks Boilers bringing them to a  Compliant  status by the State Boiler Inspector. Contractor will Certify all Repairs, Recover and Document all Repairs and Modifications by way of  Traveler History Document . This Document will cover from installation (I have requested dates of installation for each boiler) to Certification, of the Boilers located at Bldg. 13 at the Cheyenne VA Medical Center (VAMC).
Scope of Work:
This application is to have our boiler piping properly certified and stamped to pass boiler inspection. Before the piping can be certified with an  R  stamp, a Historical Traveler document must be created to document all repairs and modifications. This work can be done only by industry specialist in Boiler Safety, modification and historical tracking to ensure that repairs and certification of repairs are authenticated. 
It is believed that these requirements are highly specialized in nature and are not readily available on the open market. This project is vital to Safety Standards and Operational compliance of the Boiler Plant located at the Cheyenne VA Medical Center.

Gathering of documentation and on location visits to establish repair methodology and confirm code compliance.
Gathering all documents from Cleaver Brooks. 
Each boiler will require two visits by the Authorized Inspectors Agent (AIA).
Preform on location all repairs and modifications First day, isolate the piping, remove the valve, clean the area, perform interior inspection as required, clean the threaded areas and gather the correct material for installation.  Day 2, install the pipe and flange and install new gasket at flange as may be required. Day 3, Hydro Test the boilers as a test Hydro prior to calling inspector for final Hydro. Day 4, final Hydro Testing and inspection with AIA, complete paper work. Day 5 install boiler tags, complete copies of paper work and binder, provide to customer. Supervisor as required 3 days total.
Materials/Equipment: Pipe, Pipe compound, gaskets for flanges, fasteners as may be required, consumables, paper copies and binders supplied to customer, badge plates to be attached to boiler.


Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs: 
When the boilers were installed in 2000 they were not installed per Boiler code. To correct this non-compliance, the following has to be completed: 
Research and gather documents from Clever Brooks to assemble a certified Traveler for each boiler to document the history of modifications and repairs to each boiler.
Each Boiler will be required to undergo inspections and testing by Authorized Inspectors Agent (AIA).
Boiler repairs will require 2 certified boiler repairmen for 5 Days and an Inspector for 2 days. 
Sole Source Justification

We believe the complexity and technical aspects involved to certify past boiler repairs and to re-certify the boilers for use creates a very limited pool of firms capable of doing the work. Many of the special-duty shops have  P  stamps and can build boilers, but very few have  R  stamps that can retro-certify past boiler repairs.

4.  Contractor Qualifications: 

Must be ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Certified and accredited as repair Specialist.

 5.  Requirements: 

Contractor will be required to provide all materials, supplies, equipment, tools labor and supervision necessary to provide for every aspect of the project.

6.  Utility Shutdowns:

A.  No utility shutdown may occur without express written consent of the COR. 
B.  Except in emergency cases, any interruption, or potential interruption of power to the Cheyenne VAMC will require a minimum of two weeks  written notice prior to the shutdown.  Extended shutdowns may have to occur on weekends.
7.  Security Requirements:

All Contractor personnel shall check in daily with the VA Police Office to obtain a Contractor s Identification Badge. The badge must be worn visibly upon their person, between the height of the waist and shoulders.  The badges shall be returned at the completion of service each day.  Two forms of current federal, state issued identification are required to obtain a badge.

8.  Safety:   
All work is to be performed in accordance with all Federal, State, OSHA, and Cheyenne VAMC safety standards.

<DESC>Boston VA Research Department requires the purchase of a Thermo Scientific, Q-Exactive HF-X Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (MS) with EASY-nLC 1200 System.  This equipment will be used in support of ongoing research programs and to enhance and extend research at the VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) to the next level of molecular identification and mechanistic study. This include the following emerging proteomics technologies that are currently unavailable in VABHS: 1) identification of all possible post-translational modifications (PTMs) in proteomes of human tissue and cell samples; 2) unbiased proteomics profiling and multiplexing, peptide quantification by label-free (MRM) and isobaric mass-labeled (TMT) approaches; 3) intact protein sequencing by top-down proteomics; and 4) characterization of single amino acid polymorphisms (SAAPs) or noncoding amino acid (ncAAs) at the proteomics scale. These MS-based proteomics technologies will be applied to total proteins or the whole proteomes of human tissues, biopsies or cell lines, particularly as it applies to VA-focused diseases such as sleep disorders (SD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer s disease (AD), bladder ischemia, and other aging-related neurodegenerative disorders in veterans. These emerging technologies and services provided by the acquired instrument will fulfill the increasing needs of research projects within the VA.   This is not a solicitation announcement.

From: Veterans Health Care System of Ozarks (VHSO)

Solicitation Number: 36C25618R0336

Notice Type: Notice of Intent to Sole Source

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Healthcare System Ozarks (Fayetteville, AR) has a requirement/need for nursing home services in Van Buren, AR (Crawford County). This requirement was previously awarded to a local vendor in Van Buren, AR. The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed-price contract, on a sole source basis to Crawford Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center in Van Buren, AR.

Nursing home facilities in the Community Nursing Home (CNH) program shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  All nursing home facilities in VA s CNH program must have current Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) certification (Medicare and/or Medicaid) and a State nursing home license.  VA developed quality of care standards utilizing CMS inspection criteria that are followed by VA in its selection of nursing homes.  See VHA Handbook 1143.2,  VHA Community Nursing Home Oversight Procedures (June 4, 2004) a copy of which is available at:  http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/publications.cfm?pub=2 . VA often has a particular need for specialty care services in the CNH program. The VA requires CNHs to have bed capacity to ensure their ability to take referrals when requested.  The CNH also must be able to accept VA referrals in a timely fashion (ideally within 24 hours of request). Provider visits will be available at the rate of one (1) visit per month. Laboratory, x-ray, and other special services will be available to VA patients as needed.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, primary medical care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA-authorized level of care, without extra charge.  Duly authorized representatives of VA will provide quality oversight visits to veterans placed to assure continuity of care and to assist in the veterans  transition back into the community.  These visits do not substitute nor relieve the CNH in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.  The per diem rate(s) established in this IDC will include the cost of primary medical care, one (1) provider visit per month and needed consultation, drugs and routine supplies, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted (see Schedule of Items in this IDC for details regarding per diem rates and coverage).  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, interested parties may submit a capability statement that includes technical specifications of services, demonstrating ability to provide services described herein.

Responses under this notice must be emailed by 23 February 2018.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination not to compete this and future requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interesting parties in responding to this notice. The Government is not obligated and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.

Please email, Martin Priest at martin.priest@va.gov with responses or questions regarding this requirement. This notice will close on Friday 23 February 2018 at 4:00PM CST..

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Navy Clothing and Textile Research Facility, intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract for the acquisition of Integrated Footwear System (IFS) Cuffs. This contract will be awarded under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(5) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) only one source is reasonably available. The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Straus Knitting Mills, Inc. operating as a Small Business located in Saint Croix Falls, WI.
<p>The IFS cuffs produced by Straus Knitting Mills, Inc. are essential to the Governments requirement as they are the only tested and approved cuff supplier for the IFS system. Straus Knitting Mills, Inc. is the only source from which the required cuffs are available. There are no other commercially available cuffs that can meet the Government requirement as test data used to approve the IFS for production includes the use of this particular cuff. Use of a different manufacture cuff would require additional testing, which is both time consuming and costly and not in the best interest of the Government at this time. The IFS provides critical protection to the users in the event they become exposed to a chemical or biological agent. Omitting the IFS leaves the warfighter vulnerable in that area.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 315110 and the Small Business Size Standard is 750 employees. This is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The Government anticipates awarding one (1) contract award. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This notice is posted for ten (10) business days. No solicitation package will be available. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received by 3:00 pm EST, 02 March 2018, the contract will be issued without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this contract is based on this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any questions shall be made in writing and directed to: Ms. Yvette M Daltorio, Contract Specialist, via email at yvette.m.daltorio.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7350-01-332-2111<br />Name:		Bowl, Paper, Round, 12 oz., Natural<br />Description:	Single use compostable bowl is made of molded paper. Bowl is round and has a 12 oz. capacity. Natural. UOI is BX. BX = 1,000 bowls</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7350-01-332-2111<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	HUH21230; PACMC50012</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no adverse impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please visit http://abilityone.gov/distributors/potential.html for more information.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than March 6, 2018 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Inside Washington Publishers LLC (IWP), 1919 South Eads Street, Suite 201, Arlington, VA 22202 for the acquisition of U.S. EPA-wide access (all U.S. EPA employees, all locations) to lnsideEPA.com including Inside EPA Weekly Report, Clean Air Report, Water Policy Report, Superfund Report, Environmental Policy Alert and Risk Policy Report, and CleanEnergyReport.com.

InsideEPA.com is an online news service that comprises the Inside EPA family of environmental newsletters -- Inside EPA Weekly Report, Clean Air Report, Superfund Report, Water Policy Report, Inside Cal/EPA, Environmental Policy Alert, and Risk Policy Report. These on-line reports provided by Inside Washington Publishers, LLC (IWP) will be a resource to all Agency users to give them the most up to date information regarding protecting human health and safe guarding the environment.

IWP holds the data rights to all of the publications; and, therefore is the only source that can provide EPA with these on-line publications. Additionally, the EPA has identified IWP as the only vendor capable of satisfying these requirements. This announcement is issued under the authority of FAR 13.501(a). The circumstance permitting a sole source requirement is FAR 6.302-1- Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The EPA intends to award a base year and one (1) option year for these services in order to minimize re-procurement costs of this ongoing requirement. All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is available. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFP) or request for quotation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be disregarded.

The information received regarding this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Please direct all questions and/or responses to Darren Gann via email to gann.darren@epa.gov.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted. The point of contact for this procurement is Darren Gann, Contracting Officer, at gann.darren@epa.gov.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />i - Technical Acceptability, technical evaluation team will evaluate by assigning a rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable". The Government will evaluate a minimum of three (3) lowest priced offers for technical acceptability in accordance with the solicitation. If none of the lowest three (3) are technically acceptable, the Government will evaluate the next three (3) lowest priced proposals until one proposal is technically acceptable, or until all offers have been evaluated.

<DESC>SOLICITATION F3QCCM8026A001 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ)
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 13.303-3 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. F3QCCM8026A001. This solicitation will be solicited under Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESS SIZE STANDARD<br />(a)NAICS: 325510<br />(b)No. of Employees: 500<br />(c)Dollars:</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: <br />CLIN 0001: Purchase AC-828-C-PERC-TAN IAW attached Purchase Description. <br />Estimate of Annual Quantity: 24 drums/year</p>
<p>Price(s) should be FOB Destination (Robins AFB GA 31098). In addition to price and delivery, quote should include your cage code, DUNS number, and taxpayer ID number.</p>
<p>Quotations should be emailed to Tiffany Holmes (tiffany.holmes.2@us.af.mil) no later than Wednesday, 28 February 2018, 3:00 pm EST. The anticipated award date is 23 March 2018. Please do not request award status prior to this date.</p>
<p>Manufacturer: AC Products, Inc.</p>
<p>Justification for Sole Source Only: <br />The purpose of this acquisition is to procure chemical AC-828-C-PERC-TAN to support the AMFF Plating Shop. The Plating Shop was designed and constructed to minimize employee exposure to hazardous substances, while also increasing plating technology and capability for electroplating F-15, C-130, C-17 and C-5 aircraft components. AC Products produces a proprietary chemical used in the AMFF. This chemical has been used in Robins AFB plating facilities for years and has been proven to produce the finish coatings required to meet Air Force technical requirements. Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Force's requirements. Proprietary chemicals for the same process are not compatible with each other and the chemicals cannot be comingled. Should a new proprietary chemical be acquired, the chemical solution in the active processing tanks will need to be drained before the new chemical can be inserted into the tank. This would result in acquiring between 650 gallons to 7500 gallons, instead of the small quantities needed for routine maintenance.</p>
<p><br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS (IAW FAR 13.303-3)<br />1.This is a "Blanket Purchase Agreement" (BPA) which is a simplified form of a monthly charge account. If awarded, you will be authorized to provide Chemicals, in accordance with the attached Purchase Description when called by the designated representative(s) for 60 months after receipt of award.</p>
<p>2.It is understood and agreed that this BPA obligates the government only to the extent that authorized calls are actually made against it and then only when delivery against such calls has been completed.</p>
<p>3.BPA contractors shall be selected based on the proposed prices. Pricing shall be balanced and reasonable. The Government reserves the right to determine balance and reasonableness based on historical buys for similar product and quantity. Contractors are urged to provide pricing that is as low as or lower than those charged to their commercial customers for comparable terms. These prices must be reasonable or the government will reject the quotes.</p>
<p>4.Each individual call under this agreement shall not exceed $25,000 per call. (Each Vendor must respond with pricing and delivery information via email within 3 days)</p>
<p>5.The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor a list of individuals authorized to purchase/request service under this BPA identified by organizational component, and the component, and the dollar limitation per purchase for each individual.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation for commercial services is being conducted in conjunction with FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation OS-EMS2018-0001 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-94,2005-95. The NAICS Code is 721110, Hotels (Not Casino) and Motels, and small business size standard is $32.5M. <br /><br />The U.S. Department of Education (ED) has a requirement to obtain meeting space and hotel guest room accommodations for a conference hosted by The White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) in September 2018. The preferred dates are September 16-19, 2018, which precedes the Annual Legislative Conference of the Congressional Black Caucus. The Department will not accept the dates of September 19-23, 2018, which conflict with a Congressional Black Caucus event that may impact attendee participation.<br /><br />AREA OF CONSIDERATION: Washington, DC only, large hotels. Hotel must be able to accommodate a minimum of 400 sleeping rooms plus meeting space that can accommodate 1000 attendees in rounds, plus audio visual setup with a stage and 4 breakout rooms to accommodate 200 each in theater-style seating in each breakout room. The majority of lodging and conference rooms must be at the same general location, although we will consider partnering arrangements where locations within close proximity to each other are quoted. <br /><br />The firm selected to receive an offer from the Department is required to register in the System for Award Management (SAM) and to maintain active registration during the life of the purchase order. SAM can be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. Firms shall include their DUNS number in their quote. If the firm does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. The firm selected for an offer from the Department will need to provide Offeror Representations and Certifications prior to any award. Also, contractors should note the requirement to submit invoices electronically by means of the web-based system, Invoice Processing Platform (IPP).<br /><br />All interested, responsible sources may submit a quote directly to the U.S. Department of Education. However, the Government will not execute any contract other than with the facility or venue proposed to hold the event and provide accommodations. Any quote from a source other than the hotel or lodging venue itself must include written evidence that the offeror is currently authorized to submit binding quotes on behalf of the venue whose accommodations and/or facility are being offered. Evidence shall include a signed agreement between the vendor and the offeror. Quotes that fail to provide such evidence shall be deemed technically unacceptable and will not be considered for award. Any quote which requires the Government to make an offer that renders a hotel or facility provider as a third party or for lodging/hotel accommodations that cannot be provided at offeror's facility shall be deemed technically unacceptable and will not be considered for award.<br /><br />CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS: Submit all clarification questions concerning this solicitation in writing via E-Mail to Jermaine Sullivan at Jermaine.Sullivan@ed.gov and Gary Weaver at Gary.Weaver@ed.gov. ED will accept clarification questions until 12:00 p.m. EST Monday, March 5, 2018.

<DESC>The Library of Congress National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS/BPH) requires contractor support for the conversion of standard digital audio files of commercially published titles to a proprietary NLS/BPH Digital Talking Book (DTB) encrypted format, along with the addition of short audio introduction narration and navigation markers to key areas of each book, such as chapters. The contractor shall be responsible for either purchasing a commercially available product or creating their own software with which to accomplish the conversions.<br /><br />A very small number of titles (estimated at fewer than 100 titles per year) will require Spanish narration and conversion of the annotation. Offerors are not required to provide Spanish narration and conversion; however, those who can provide Spanish narration and conversion should clearly state this in their proposals.<br /><br />See attached RFP for more detailed information.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.
(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the
Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

The Concept 2 uses air resistance generated by the fanned flywheel. To adjust how much air enters the flywheel housing on each stroke, the Model D Rower includes a unique spiral damper adjustable from a setting of 1 to 10.

The Spud Inc sled strap is made from the most durable webbing that will never wear out. Stop using cables and chains that get frayed and have sharp edges to cut you with, and start using the Spud Inc sled strap. One end is fitted with a large shackle that will fit most any sled and the other end has a 4 inch wide delta ring that will slide over a standard power belt. The sled strap is great for using with our lower body and upper body sled straps. Want an alternative to a heavy power belt when pulling the sled? Try the Spud, Inc. sled pulling belt, made so you can easily pull forwards, backwards or sideways. If you are planning to pull a heavy load then you might consider the Strongman harness which distributes the load across the upper body making it more comfortable for maximal loading. Maybe, you are training your sprints. If so, our track harness is a good light weight alternative for sprints with your sled.
