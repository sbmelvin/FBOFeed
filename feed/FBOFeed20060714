<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Spokane, WA hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Interactive Consulting, Spokane, WA for follow-on work related to purchase order 200-2005-M-13583 that was awarded to Interactive Consulting during FY2005 under a competetive solicitation.

Over the last year and  a half, Interactive Consulting, Inc. has developed the Nanoparticle Information Library (NIL) web site for NIOSH, with a strong underlying foundation for basic nanoparticle information, contributor information, searching, and general information.  In the next phase of development, we would like to strengthen the functionality of the site, enhance data structures, particularly in the areas of safety and health, and create a robust mechanism and protocol for data submission and integrate the data with other related databases that are being built by public and private organizations.

Recompeting the requirement would be disruptive to this ongoing effort and would cause significant time loss and project delays.  Owing to the learning curve to become integrated into this project, it would not be cost effective for the agency to recompete the existing requirement.  Accordingly, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the agency considers Interactive Consulting as the only vendor capable of meeting the agency's needs.  Therefore, this notice is being issued for information purposes only; no solicitation is being issued as negotiations will be conducted ona sole source basis with Interactive Consulting.

<CONTACT>PHYLLIS MICHEL - pmichel@usgs.gov Contracting Officer 6503294163     pmichel@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Earthquake Hazards Program, requires a near-real-time, low-cost, low-maintenance; Internet-capable strong-motion system that records earthquake ground motion from tri-axial accelerometers ("the appliance") and associated server software. This is an announcement of an RFP for proposals for the appliance and software. The recording instruments will have a dynamic range of ~90 dB for extensive urban deployments where the cultural noise level is relatively high. The USGS envisions installing urban arrays of 500 to 1000 or more appliances with spacing of ~100 to 1000 meters to operate at low cost for ~10 years, utilizing the extensive Internet infrastructure in urban areas to minimize telemetry costs. The appliance will have built-in wireless Ethernet hardware to allow access to wireless routers operating in residences and offices; automatically forward event waveforms, parametric data, and health messages to a server via the Internet; store event waveform and parametric data indefinitely if connection is lost until reestablished; initiate all connections to the operator's server to transmit information; utilize a Linux OS; and be easily serviceable by hosts of the appliance. Detailed mandatory and desired specifications and evaluation criteria will be given in the RFP. The USGS expects to award a single fixed-price requirements-type contract for one year commencing date of award with 4 options to extend for one year; contract period NTE 5 years. Initial order: up to 50 units, including 3 units for first article testing within 9 months after award. RFP will be issued o/a 8/7/06 on the NBC website but proposals must be submitted to the address to be shown on the RFP. Send questions about the requirement to the contracting officer at pmichel@usgs.gov. See Note 26.

<DESC>The BLM has a requirement for a cultural resource inventory report for 900 acres of Class III, intensive, inventory of rolling mesatop terrain bisected by  steep rugged canyons.  Vegetation consists of dense woodland interspersed amid broad open areas of sage on the mesatops with sparse pinyon and juniper woodland on the canyon talus slopes and riparian vegetation in the canyon bottoms.  Moderate to deep reddish-brown windblown loess deposits occur on the mesatops with eroded sandstones and shales across the drainage/canyon slopes.  The mesatop soils were fertile and well-drained and frequently utilized by prehistoric pueblo peoples for farming; and elevations and climate in this area are suitable for growing corn.  Evidence of historic agricultural development in this area exists as well and may possess a high degree of integrity as public access to this area has been generally limited by adjacent private land and the lack of easy public access. The period of performance is from August 1st, 2006 through December 31, 2006. This requirement is open to Total Small Business Set Asides.  The estimated price range is between $25,000.00 and $75,000.00.  The solicitation will be available by electronic posting only and may be found at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Bidders may print the bid documents to submit their bid by mail, or bids may be submitted electronically.  No facsimile bids will be accepted.

<DESC>The BLM has a requirement for a cultural resource inventory report for 1770 acres of Class III, intensive inventory of rolling terrain in the mixed conifer and mountain shrub vegetative zones south of Gunnison, Colorado and west of Gold Basin Creek.  There are three previously recorded sites within the survey area.  These vegetative zones are known to have been utilized prehistorically for brief episodes of hunting and gathering primarily.  Erosion has altered the ground surface in some of the area scattering artifacts and removing topsoil, however in the deeper soil areas, subsurface remains including dateable hearths or processing areas can retain a high degree of integrity. This requirement is open to Total Small Business Set Asides.  The estimated price range is between $25,000.00 and $50,000.00.

A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSCPOL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(b)	The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].

The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price contract.  The contractor shall provide scientific library and technical information services required to meet the programmatic responsibilities and assigned mission of the NOS CCEHBR.  The work will shall be performed at the library of the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, Marine Resources Division (SCDNR/MRD), the Contractor’s library, and CCEHBR.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks:  accommodate, maintain, and make available to CCEHBR personnel and other authorized users, the current library holdings and future library acquisitions of CCEHBR; provide library services on a normal business schedule during which SCDNR/MRD library is staffed; provide 24/7 access to the reading and study areas; procure and renew annual subscriptions to journals and other periodical publications; provide an automated catalog system to identify all Government library materials separately and distinctly from other materials co-located at the SCDNR/MRD library; provide reference materials, interlibrary loans, document delivery, and bibliographic services including manual and on-line information retrieval searches; provide for delivery of documents to CCEHBR within the constraints of extant copyright law within 24-48 hours following a request from Government personnel.  Proposed contract term is for one base year plus four one-year option periods.  NOS CCEHBR has a science laboratory co-located in a community of marine science institutions.  The Government seeks to ensure staff access in the Charleston, South Carolina area to a comprehensive, physical library collection while providing access for select personnel to more sophisticated or extensive library services, as needed.  The CofC’s library is the only identifiable source that is able to provide the on-site facilities and meet the specified requirements of CCEHBR.  The CofC library is located within 600 yards from the CCEHBR’s facility and is readily accessible to CCEHBR scientific staff.  The library also provides similar services to the College of Charleston Grice Marine Biology Laboratory and the NOAA Hollings Marine Laboratory, both of which are located on the SCDNR campus.  Through frequent collaboration, CCEHBR, SCDNR and MRD perform environmental research.  Therefore, all reference, research material and peer reviews must be easily accessible and stored in a centrally located facility.    The partnership between CCEHBR and these other on-site research institutions is strengthened by the library’s crucial role in meeting a common need for distributing and sharing of scientific and technical information.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by 24 July 2006.  Written requests for additional information may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The procurement contemplated is for a Radar Target Generators (RTG) for the APG-63 (V)1 and APG-70 radar test benches at the Integrated Avionics Test Facility (IATF) IAW specifications and attachments identified in the solicitation.  This RTS shall include hardware and software to realisitically generate precise, user-defined target returns for the APG-63(V)1 and APG-70 radar systems.  The completed effort will provide a fully-integrated RTS with multiple target channels capable of accurately producing synthetic radar targets.The IATF uses RTGs to conduct radar operational flight program (OFP) testing for F-15 aircraft.  Det 2, 28 TS currently has no target generation capability for the APG-63(V)1 radar, which is installed in the majority of the F-15C aircraft fleet.  The absence of aan APG-63(V)1 RTS prevents the IATF from fully evaluating the APG-63(V)1.  Additionally, the existing IATF APG-70 RTS is based on obsolete technology and is over 10 years old.  The age of the existing APG-70 RTS is becoming a limiting factor as the parts continue to age and fail.  These deficiencies severely limit the Air Force’s ability to fully test F-15 OFPs as they are released to the community.  The IATF’s focus on integrated avionics testing hinges on the ability to generate realistic radar targets with overlaid jamming to evaluate the radar’s performance in an electronic attack environment.  Completion of the RTS integration will permit successful F-15 radar testing and allow versatility and increased cost savings not possible through conventional flight testingflight-testing. A firm-fixed price contract award is contemplated. This action will be unrestricted and open to all parties interested. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511 with a small business employee size standard of 750. It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 16 June 2006 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

Contractors must be prepared to provide the government with specific information for clearance into the IATF such as Name, SSAN, Clearance Level, Citizenship, DOB, POB, and Unit/Company Assigned.

1.  The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering is preparing to purchase GPS survey equipment used to support academic classes.  The only acceptable product is the 5700RTK-PB05 GPS surveying kit manufactured and distributed by Trimble Navigation Limited because this equipment is the DoD standard.  We estimate the cost of this requirement to be about $112,600.00 (attachment 1).

2.  The 5700RTK-PB05 surveying system has been standardized by the USAF, Marines, Army, and Navy.  The Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency has issued this equipment to most Civil Engineer UTCs containing engineers.  The Air Force Civil Engineer training detachment at Ft. Leonard Wood, MO, and the Silver Flag Schools teach this make/model and no other equipment is authorized.  

3.  Military unique software programs, not available on the commercial market, are loaded into these systems making them “controlled items”.  As such, this model is not available to any Trimble distributor.  It is only available to the US Military and approved Foreign Military Sales countries directly from the manufacturer, Trimble Navigation Limited.

4.  Based on the above information, we recommend the 5700RTK-PB05 GPS surveying kit manufactured and distributed by Trimble Navigation Systems as the only product capable of meeting the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering’s requirement to provide cadets with hands-on applications they will see once they move on to the operational Air Force.  The requiring activity certifies that the information provided to support this recommendation is complete and accurate to the best of our knowledge.  Copies of supporting documentation can be obtained from the requiring activity.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) intends to negotiate with Science Applications International Corporation, 10260 Campus Point Drive, San Diego CA 92121, on a sole source basis.  The proposed Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is to provide a twenty-four month effort for continued support at the Navy's Maritime Synthetic Range (MSR) located in the Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF).  The objective of this MSR project is to provide the ability to support Naval training exercises in the region that use live, virtual and constructive technologies for affordable training and mission rehearsal in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Mine Warfare (MIW), and Surface Warfare (SUW) beyond PMRF to the Mid-Pacific Area of Responsibility (AOR).  General capabilities to be developed include the following:  1) Real-time participation in operational training by units pier-side, underway or deployed; 2) creation of synthetic Blue Forces and Opposition Forces to support training; 3) Scenario generation based on geographic terrain and bathymetry databases to enable realistic training and mission planning; 4) Creation of common synthetic battlespace and generation of advanced threat environments; and 5) Extension of coordinated Anti-Submarine Warfare / Under-Sea Warfare/Surface Warfare/Mine Warfare training provided by PMRF and other training facilities in the Mid-Pacific region.  The initial effort will involve a study and analysis to specifically outline the tasking needed to expand these five MSR capabilities into the entire Mid-Pacific AOR.  In performing these functions, the contractor shall maintain previously developed MSR technologies, as well as continue to develop technology solutions for MSR that support experimentation within the operational environment at PMRF and the Mid-Pacific AOR.  SAIC has been providing support to the PMRF facility since Government fiscal year 2000, resulting in unique capabilities that cannot be recovered through competition without substantial duplication of costs.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>B-The U. S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/NESDIS/CRAD intends to negotiate with the University of Wisconsin System, Madison, WI on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. ( c ) ( 1 ) only one source to provide research services for Validating the geolocation and calibration of the VHRR data from INSAT-3A and Kalpana-1 satellites. VHRR data from Klpana-1 Meteorological Satellite as transmitted by the India Meteorological Department, New Delhi to NOAA/NESDIS has been rendered useful through routine geolocation effort at the University of Wisconsin. The results accumulated since May 2005 indicate that the VHRR instrument exhibits some anomalous behavior that manifests itself through some systematic East-West and North-South biases equivalent to about 1.5 or more IR pixels in different quadrants of the image, away from the central portions covering the Indian sub-continent. Geolocated  Kalpana  VHRR data at SSEC are being currently utilized for rainfall estimation and this work is being continued in the future. It is therefore necessary to continue to geolocate the Kalpana VHRR data and provide it for users and to continue efforts to improve the geolocation with ISRO’s help. Task are 1) intercomparison of the thermal and water vapor channel radiometric calibrations between VHRR data from Kalpana and INSAT 3 A  and other satellite data such as from METEOSAT and METSAT by comparing ocean and cloud top temperatures from co-location, concurrent data. 2) Geolocation of INSAT-3A VHRR data. This requires a follow-up request from NOAA to IMD for the delivery of the data as to date the data are not being transmitted from IMD. 3) Comparison of Cloud Motion Vectors from VHRR data and those from other satellites over the region (METEOSAT, METSAT, BY2C)  over a selected period and geographical area. 4) Training of IMD/ISRO personnel in New Delhi in the use of MCIDAS and in comparative analysis of INSAT data within MCIDAS.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for detailed information about components which would be suitable for the lander propulsion system. The design calls for a 64 kg total (wet) mass vehicle which will travel on a 5 day trajectory to the moon. The lander will require 540 m/s of pulse width modulated delta-V which must be available for use during the entire mission (trajectory correction maneuvers during trans lunar flight as well as during final descent). The propulsion system requires a descent and landing engine with approximately 2000N thrust, aligned with the center of gravity of the propulsion system with minimal descent thrust misalignment relative to the center of gravity due to propellant consumption. At a minimum, NASA will require one propulsion system to support hover tests beginning in May 2007 and one propulsion system to support the first flight in June 2008. Only components which have a demonstrated test and space flight history will be considered. The propulsion system must be compatible with other lander components NASA/ARC intends to: (1) The Government plans to conduct a phased acquisition involving a competitive down-selection process.  Phase I is for the Propulsion system concept report which could be used to build a lander propulsion system to meet the mission requirements.  Phase 2 is for one propulsion system to support hover tests in May 2007 and one propulsion system to support first flight June 2008. (2) Competitions for identified subsequent phases will build on the results of previous phases. (3) The award criteria for subsequent phases will include demonstrated completion of specified previous phase requirements. (4) The Government expects that only the initial phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase(s). Proposals for the subsequent phase(s) will be requested from these contractors. (5) The Government does not intend to issue a new, formal solicitation for subsequent phases. This is a progressive competition and after evaluation of Phase I submissions a negotiated contract will be issued that will contain the statment of work, specifications, proposal preparation instructions, and evaluation factors for award.   (6) Each subsequent phase of the acquisition will be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.201 and 5.203. (7) Notwithstanding the expectation that only the initial phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase(s), proposals from all responsible sources submitted by the specified due date will be considered. In order to contend for subsequent phase awards, however, such prospective offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the prior phase contractors. Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award. NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Aerojet General Corporation, Rancho Cordova, CA. and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, Inc., Canoga Park, CA. Aerojet and Rocketdyne are the only suppliers of off-the-shelf, space-qualified propulsion systems suitable for the small lander mission and can be available for ground testing in 2007 and launch in 2008. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on July 28, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) maintenance agreement for the following equipment: (1) Philips XL40 FEG Scanning Electron Microscope (XL40FEGI), (2) Infrared Camera Addition (5244XL), (3) Backscatter Electron System Addition (5235XL), (4) Photomonitor Addition (5238XL), and (5) Turbomolecular Pump (5211).  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the preventative service agreement from FEI Company (formerly Philips Electron Optics). The SEM is a Philips XL40 FEG instrument which was manufactured by Philips and has been serviced by Philips since the purchase of this microscope in 1995. The service contract will continue the warranty (through FEI Company) of a great many of the instrument's components and will represent a significant savings to JSC if any of the warranted components have to be replaced. Proper maintenance and rapid troubleshooting require a familiarity with the characteristics of the SEM instrument. Troubleshooting often requires comparing voltages and waveforms of a working instrument with a malfunctioning instrument or actual exchange of modules and components. Only FEI Company has the capability, and an established organization for providing such servicing of this instrument. The established organization includes training service engineers, spare parts inventory, maintenance manuals, access to other working instruments, and years of experience with the instrument.  The basic period of performance is for one year and four options for additional annual extensions are anticipated. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on July 19, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

The  identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00182.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-11.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.   The NAICS code is 541620, and the size standard is $6.5 million.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.   Project Identification:  Consultation for Air Quality Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen: Mortality II.  Period of Performance:  August 2006- August  2008 III.  Type of Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed  Price (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) IV.  Estimated Level of Effort:   217 hours for Tasks 1-8 (50 hours for Optional Task 9-10) BACKGROUND The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of this process, the National Center  for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) review and integrate new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known as a Criteria Document.   The EPA is now in the process  of reviewing the NAAQS for NO2.  On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary and secondary NAAQS for NO2 at 0.053 parts per million (ppm), annual average based on the findings outlined in the 1971 NO2 Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). In 1982, EPA published the Air Quality Criteria for  Oxides of Nitrogen (EPA, 1982), which updated the scientific criteria upon which the initial standards were based. On February 23, 1984, the EPA proposed to retain this standard which was finalized on June 19, 1985.  The most recent review of the science on nitrogen oxides is included in the 1993  Air Quality Criteria for Oxides of Nitrogen (EPA-600/8-91/049cF).  In this review, the Administrator announced a final decision not to revise the standards on October 2, 1995.  The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for NO2 is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be  established as a court-ordered schedule. The EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NO2 SA by July 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the NO2 air quality standard.  The EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for  interim steps in the development of the NO2 SA, including completion of the first draft of the NO2 SA by July 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen oxides shall be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and the Science Assessment (SA).  The first draft of  the SASD will be reviewed at an authors review meeting sponsored by the EPA. This draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer review draft that shall be reviewed by peer reviewers at a public meeting. Peer review comments will be incorporated in the draft final SASD.  After the peer review  comments are incorporated to the draft final SASD, the SA (a  focused integrative document) shall be prepared as an external review draft  for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for  public comment.  The EPA anticipates  preparing two drafts of the NO2 SA for public and CASAC review, before completion of the final NO2 SA.  NCEA is seeking to retain the professional services of scientists to assist with the review, critical evaluation summary and integration of the available scientific database on oxides of  nitrogen physical and chemical properties, measurement methods, environmental sources, concentrations, and pathways to human exposure, environmental effects, toxicological and human effects, and an evaluation of health risks to include public health significance. Under this order, the EPA seeks  the professional services of an expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing human health risks from oxides of nitrogen exposure.  ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments 1-4, the EPA could  not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Opps website.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620               NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The  identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00184.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-11.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.   The NAICS code is 541620, and the size standard is $6.5 million.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.   Project Identification:  Consultation for Air Quality Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen: Statistical Issues and Analyses II.  Period of Performance:  August 2006- August  2008 III.  Type of  Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) IV.  Estimated Level of Effort:   217 hours for Tasks 1-8 (50 hours for Optional Task 9-10) BACKGROUND The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of this  process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) review and integrate new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known as a Criteria Document.   The EPA is now in the process of reviewing the NAAQS for NO2.  On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary and secondary NAAQS for NO2 at 0.053 parts per million (ppm), annual average based on the findings outlined in the 1971 NO2 Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). In 1982, EPA published  the Air Quality Criteria for Oxides of Nitrogen (EPA, 1982), which updated the scientific criteria upon which the initial standards were based. On February 23, 1984, the EPA proposed to retain this standard which was finalized on June 19, 1985.  The most recent review of the science on nitrogen  oxides is included in the 1993 Air Quality Criteria for Oxides of Nitrogen (EPA-600/8-91/049cF).  In this review, the Administrator announced a final decision not to revise the standards on October 2, 1995.  The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for NO2 is the subject of ongoing  litigation and will eventually be established as a court-ordered schedule. The EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the NO2 SA by July 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the NO2 air quality standard.  The EPA's proposed schedule also  includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the NO2 SA, including completion of the first draft of the NO2 SA by July 2007. The scientific information on nitrogen oxides shall be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and the Science  Assessment (SA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors review meeting sponsored by the EPA. This draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer review draft that shall be reviewed by peer reviewers at a public meeting. Peer review comments will be incorporated in the draft final  SASD.  After the peer review comments are incorporated to the draft final SASD, the SA (a  focused integrative document) shall be prepared as an external review draft  for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for  public  comment.  The EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the NO2 SA for public and CASAC review, before completion of the final NO2 SA.  NCEA is seeking to retain the professional services of scientists to assist with the review, critical evaluation summary and integration of the available scientific  database on oxides of nitrogen physical and chemical properties, measurement methods, environmental sources, concentrations, and pathways to human exposure, environmental effects, toxicological and human effects, and an evaluation of health risks to include public health significance. Under this  order, the EPA seeks the professional services of an expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing human health risks from oxides of nitrogen exposure.  ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and  Attachments 1-4, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Opps website.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH has a requirement to:  update and expand in number and scope, the existing Highmark's, Inc. databases for industry analysis of medical claims; to conduct analysis of rates and costs of diseases that will be used in reports to employers; and to support tracking and reporting on outreach to employers.     NIOSH has been working the last four years to develop methods of calculating and interpreting industry disease rates using group medical claims and insurance enrollment data. The goal is to provide useful information to employers that will identify prevention opportunities and to indicate need for further investigation of associations between particular industries and health conditions. Purchase of additional detailed data and analysis for priority diseases and of reports on outreach to employers using analysis results and prevention recommendations from NIOSH will enable timely demonstration of a new model of occupational tracking and prevention.  No solicitation is available, however interested parties may request a copy of the scope of work.   The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Independence Blue Cross as the only insurer who currently has developed the capability of calculating specific disease rates by detailed industry and who is prepared to convey this information to employers along with recommendations for prevention.  The time period for this project is September 1, 2006 through October 15, 2007.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Reuseable Modular Self-contained Self-Rescuer training unit
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-HCCC2-2006-34078
<RESPDATE>073106
<ARCHDATE>08152006
<CONTACT>Brenda Goodwin, Contract Specialist, Phone (304)285-5882, Fax (304)285-6083, Email bcg1@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NIOSH, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory has a requirement to purchase 100 reuseable modular self-contained self-rescuer (SCSR) live training units (SR-T, P/N Q152501001) and associated SR-T canister assembly (P/N Q152502001) which accurately recreates the experience of using a SCSR in a mining emergency. The need for this device has developed due to the recent mining disasters.  
  
GENERAL DESCRIPTION 

The CSE SR-T Training Unit is a live training unit  designed for use in conjunction with the CSE SR-100.  The SR-T accurately recreates the experience of using an SR-100 also known collectively as Self-Contained Self-Rescuer (SCSR) in an emergency situation. Training with the SR-T will give the user a chance to experience the sensations that are common with CSE’s SR-100.  The SR-T has been designed to operate for 10 - 15 minutes.  During this span of time, the user will experience the pressure and temperature sensations that occur towards the end of the rated duration of the SCSR. The user will also have the opportunity to practice the CSE SCSR Manual start-up procedure.  This procedure is detailed in the SR-100 Manual, and may be needed if the oxygen bottle in the SCSR is prematurely deployed.  All of these factors will help raise the users knowledge and confidence should he ever be faced with a circumstance in which the SCSR must be donned.   

The SR-T is similar in function to the full sized SCSR.  The SR-T utilizes a bi-directional breathing pathway through a chemical bed which replenishes the oxygen in the users exhaled breath  while simultaneously removing the carbon dioxide.  Unlike the SR-100, the SR-T has been specially designed to be a modular system.  This innovative design allows the breathing canister to be removed and discarded after use, while the other components can be reused.

There is no other source known to exist on the market that manufactures this type of training SCSR other than CSE Corporation, Monroeville, PA.  No solicitation is available.   Responsible sources that believe they can provide an equal product are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their written specifications and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.       Please submit capabilities and supporting information to:           Brenda L. Goodwin, REFERENCE:     HCCC2-2006-34078, CDC/PGO/AAFB, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV     26505, voice 304/285-5882, fax 304/285-6083 or e-mail bcg1@cdc.gov.     The Government will review any/all information submitted  for technical compliance with the stated performance specifications and determine if other qualified sources do exist.       Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.           

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, per FAR 13.106-1(b)(1),negotiations will be on a sole source basis conducted solely with CSE Corporation, as the only company meeting our needs and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Multi-Analye COOH Microspheres

Purpose/Brief History:

Pediatric Oncology Branch of the National Cancer Institute is engaged in the study of discovery of miRNAs that play important roles in human neuroblastoma. 

From prior studies using microarray, miRNA expression was profiled in 100 neuroblastoma samples. In this project, the microarray results will be verified using quantitative method. Bead-based array has been used to detect miRNAs due to its capability of multiplex (up to 100) and flexibility. 

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

Luminex beads are proprietary 100 distinct color-coded microspheres designed and manufactured by Luminex Corporation for their bead-based detection systems (e.g. Luminex 100 IS). The beads are covered with reactive functional groups (in this case –COOH) for attaching various capture biological molecules including DNA oligos. The major advantages of these beads are:
1)	The hybridization reaction is completed faster (15 min to 1 hour) than the conventional slide-based microarray techniques (~16 hours).
2)	Bead-based hybridization results in more reproducible data than the slide-based method.
3)	The platform is very flexible to adding novel target genes.
4)	The assay is quantitative rather than qualitative compared to the conventional microarray.
5)	100 distinct color-coded beads give this system multiplexibility compared to qPCR method.

Luminex Corporation is the only manufacturer of these proprietary beads. Luminex beads have been in the market since 1995 and have been successfully used in SNP geno-typing, gene expression and protein detection methods. We already have acquired the detection system, Luminex 100 IS, and have been testing the beads on the instrument. The Luminex system fulfills the quantization needs for specific RNAs in biological samples in a high-throughput fashion. Since the Government has been testing a few Luminex beads for pilot studies successfully, it plans to continue its ongoing project in an expended scale using the full capacity of 100 Luminex beads.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>4905
<RESPDATE>071406
<CONTACT>Joe Carey, 202-267-5814
<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAS BEEN CANCELLED AND MAY BE ANNOUNCED AT A LATER DATE 1.	Description:  This is a Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) and not a solicitation.   This is a broad interagency announcement for information on available technologies that may relate to or support air surveillance and network enabled operations for aviation.  The Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (Vision 100, P.L. 108-176) calls for an integrated, multi-agency plan to transform the nation's air transportation system to meet the needs of the year 2025 while providing substantial near-term benefits. This Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS) Initiative will address critical safety and economic needs in civil aviation while fully integrating national defense and homeland security improvements into this future system.  (See www.jpdo.aero for additional details). The JPDO has formed Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) to plan out the work that needs to be coordinated to realize the NGATS Concept of Use and its capabilities.  The Shared Situational Awareness IPT is responsible for planning the methods by which information will be shared, discovered, and managed by the aviation community in 2025.  The Air Domain Awareness Subgroup is to ensure maximum awareness of objects within the airspace by comparing cooperative and non-cooperative legacy surveillance capabilities against high level NGATS surveillance requirements to determine gaps, recommend future research and development, and identify integration initiatives and to manage an architecture roadmap from now to 2025.   2.	Scope:  In order to assess potential solutions, particularly products that are either available or under development, interested companies should submit packages of their surveillance and information sharing capabilities and the applicability to aviation.     3.	Focus Areas: a.	Focus area One - Air Surveillance Capabilities, both air-air and ground-air, both cooperative (requiring avionics on board the airborne object) and non-cooperative (will function regardless of airborne object equipage). b.	Focus Area Two - Network Enabled Technology to the extent that it is directly related to air surveillance capabilities, processes, and/or techniques.   c.	Focus Area Three - Aviation Datalink, including Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground data transfer solutions. 4.	Requirements:  The RFI packages should include a description of : a.	Proposed system, equipment or suite of equipment to meet some or all of the focus areas being responded to.  (Companies may respond to any one or all of the three (3) focus areas.  Please provide separate responses for each focus area if practicable. b.	System level description / simplified diagrams of the proposed solution. c.	Recommendation for upgrading and integration current systems to meet transitional requirements. d.	All interfaces among equipment in the proposed system and elements of the aviation system. e.	Capabilities and functionality the system could provide. f.	If available, please include rough-order-magnitude (ROM) cost and anticipated availability of the solution:   1.	Total estimated cost of the project 2.	Estimated cost broken down for each year of the program g.	A statement regarding possible impact, if any, on the environment. In order to streamline the RFI process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a full RFI response, it is requested that the offerors first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation. >From this summary concept paper the Government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Government and whether a formal RFI response would be likely to succeed.     The Government, at its option, may provide comments that might be of assistance to the submitter in determining how or whether to submit a response.  Concept papers will be evaluated as soon as they are received.  Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will not be made, and concept papers will not be returned. The Contracting Office will ask only those offerors with promising concept papers to submit full response to the RFI.  The Contracting Office will notify offerors within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of concept paper if a full response is requested.  Concept papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data.  All proprietary material should be clearly marked. The summary concept paper should state the proposed technical concept including the rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and its contribution to the SSA IPT, Air Domain Awareness initiative.  In addition, the summary concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost and offerors past performance on Government contracts. The concept paper shall be limited to five (5) pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), of English text with one additional page for technical drawing if necessary, and shall be in MS Word for Windows format. No classified data shall be included in the concept paper.  A review of concept papers by the Government will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to merit a more comprehensive information package.  If there is sufficient interest, offerors will be notified to submit a detailed information package for further evaluation.  Concept papers will be evaluated on technical merit and offerors past performance.   5.	Submission Details:  The concept paper should include a one (1) page Executive Summary with the following key elements outlined: a.	Class of technology (e.g., Surveillance, NEO, Aviation Datalink) b.	Maturity of technology 1.	Ready to field 2.	1-3 years to field 3.	4+ years to field c.	One (1) paragraph description of capability d.	Applicability to aviation e.	Brief narrative/description f.	Current government contracts g.	Anticipated cost profile h.	Size and status of business i.	Focal point for additional information 6.	Point of Contact:  The RFI packages are due to Robert Lake (Tel: 202-220-3374; Email: Robert.CTR.Lake@faa.gov) or William Mahony (Tel: 202-220-3350; Email: William.Mahony@faa.gov no later than fifteen (15) business days from publication of this announcement.

The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.  The acquisition is for DRYDOCK repairs to 47 Foot “B” Class Motor Lifeboats. These vessels are tentatively geographically restricted to 140 nautical miles from Woods Hole, MA. The requirements period is to run 12 months from date of award. The procurement contains Two (2) 12 month option years to be exercised at the government’s discretion. The scope of the acquisition is for the overhauling, renewing and repairing of various items aboard the 47 Foot “B” Class Motor Lifeboats.

This work will include, but is not limited to:  Welding Repairs; Renew, Inspect, and Reinstall Propeller Shafts; Straighten Shaft; Renew Propulsion Shaft Strut and Stern Tube Bearings; Renew, Inspect, and Reinstall Rub Rail; Remove, Inspect, and Test Upper Buoyancy Chamber; Renew Strut; Remove and Reinstall Main Engine; Remove, Inspect, and Reinstall Propeller; Perform Minor Repair and Reconditioning of Propeller; Install Government-furnished Fathometer Transducer; Test and Renew Valves; Inspect Hydraulic Steering Gear; Inspect Duplex Sea Strainers; Remove, Inspect and Reinstall Rudder Assembly; Renew Rudder Bearings; Preserve Underwater Body; Provide Temporary Logistics; Routine Drydocking; and Clean, Inspect, and Air Test Fuel Tank. 

Trained welders, who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures, shall accomplish all welding and brazing.  At the present time, it is expected that the acquisition will be issued as a small business set aside.  However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305 if your firm is HUBZone certified or a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to dawn.j.dabney@uscg.mil or by fax at (757) 628-4676.  Questions may be referred to Dawn J. Dabney at (757) 628-4636.  In your response you must include: (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contact and telephone numbers; and (d) if your company does not own the drydock, a letter of commitment from the company providing the drydock committing to provide the drydock during the time period of this availability.  At least two references are requested, but more are desirable.  Your response is required by March 21, 2006.  Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUBZone Set-aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.   Contractors are also reminded that should this acquisition become a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business set aside, FAR 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone set-aside or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in Small Business set-aside acquisition.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone Small Business set-aside, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside or a Small Business set-aside, will be posted in FedBizOpps website at http://www.eps.gov.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER IS CHANGED FROM FA4819-06-T-0033 TO FA4819-06-R-0008.  The procurement contemplated is for a Radar Target Generators (RTG) for the APG-63 (V)1 and APG-70 radar test benches at the Integrated Avionics Test Facility (IATF) IAW specifications and attachments identified in the solicitation.  This RTS shall include hardware and software to realisitically generate precise, user-defined target returns for the APG-63(V)1 and APG-70 radar systems.  The completed effort will provide a fully-integrated RTS with multiple target channels capable of accurately producing synthetic radar targets.The IATF uses RTGs to conduct radar operational flight program (OFP) testing for F-15 aircraft.  Det 2, 28 TS currently has no target generation capability for the APG-63(V)1 radar, which is installed in the majority of the F-15C aircraft fleet.  The absence of aan APG-63(V)1 RTS prevents the IATF from fully evaluating the APG-63(V)1.  Additionally, the existing IATF APG-70 RTS is based on obsolete technology and is over 10 years old.  The age of the existing APG-70 RTS is becoming a limiting factor as the parts continue to age and fail.  These deficiencies severely limit the Air Force’s ability to fully test F-15 OFPs as they are released to the community.  The IATF’s focus on integrated avionics testing hinges on the ability to generate realistic radar targets with overlaid jamming to evaluate the radar’s performance in an electronic attack environment.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER IS CHANGED FROM FA4819-06-T-0033 TO FA4819-06-R-0008.                                                        The procurement contemplated is for a Radar Target Generators (RTG) for the APG-63 (V)1 and APG-70 radar test benches at the Integrated Avionics Test Facility (IATF) IAW specifications and attachments identified in the solicitation.  This RTS shall include hardware and software to realisitically generate precise, user-defined target returns for the APG-63(V)1 and APG-70 radar systems.  The completed effort will provide a fully-integrated RTS with multiple target channels capable of accurately producing synthetic radar targets.The IATF uses RTGs to conduct radar operational flight program (OFP) testing for F-15 aircraft.  Det 2, 28 TS currently has no target generation capability for the APG-63(V)1 radar, which is installed in the majority of the F-15C aircraft fleet.  The absence of aan APG-63(V)1 RTS prevents the IATF from fully evaluating the APG-63(V)1.  Additionally, the existing IATF APG-70 RTS is based on obsolete technology and is over 10 years old.  The age of the existing APG-70 RTS is becoming a limiting factor as the parts continue to age and fail.  These deficiencies severely limit the Air Force’s ability to fully test F-15 OFPs as they are released to the community.  The IATF’s focus on integrated avionics testing hinges on the ability to generate realistic radar targets with overlaid jamming to evaluate the radar’s performance in an electronic attack environment.  Completion of the RTS integration will permit successful F-15 radar testing and allow versatility and increased cost savings not possible through conventional flight testingflight-testing. A firm-fixed price contract award is contemplated. This action will be unrestricted and open to all parties interested. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511 with a small business employee size standard of 750. It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 16 June 2006 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

1.  Step van/panel truck 
2.  Tractor/trailer, box and flat bed containing cargo
3.  Tanker trucks 
4.  Box trucks
5.  Tour buses

7.  Concrete trucks/mixers, dump trucks
8.  Cranes, recreational vehicles, petroleum tanker 
This inspection will be conducted at Gate 16A located off State Route 444.
The following are exemptions to vehicles utilizing the CVDG:
 1.  If the vehicle has the product inside (concrete and asphalt trucks) and timely delivery is necessary due to product deterioration it does not need to enter the CVDG.  To bypass the CVDG, the contractor shall submit a list containing drivers’ names, social security numbers and the state in which the driver's license is held for those drivers who will be entering the base.  This shall be accomplished 24 hours prior to requested entry time.  If entry is requested on Monday, this list must be submitted by Friday at 1630 hours.   All lists shall be submitted to the 88th ABW/CE Directorate contract inspector.  The only gates that may be used under this exemption shall be 15A, 26C, 38C, 1B, 26C and gate 1B.  If the driver's name is not on the list, he/she will not be allowed access to the installation through these gates and the base will not assume liability for denied access.  
 2. If a delivery vehicle must exit, and then re-enter the base to complete its route, the vehicle shall be resealed upon exiting the base.   After initially passing through the commercial vehicle delivery gate, trucks shall be resealed at Gates 15A, 38C and 22B.  The resealing of the trucks will allow them to continue to any other area of the installation (Areas A, B, C, or Kittyhawk) without reprocessing through the CVDG.  To receive resealing assistance, the drivers shall physically stop at one of the three authorized gates and request the installation entry controller to reseal their truck and provide the next location of their delivery.  The controller will reseal the truck and give the delivery driver a pre-clearance form. The driver shall present the pre-clearance form to the entry controller at the next point of installation entry. This reentry can be through any base gate.
Vehicles may be subject to an inspection at any of installation entry control points during a directed random antiterrorism measure (RAM.)  Any commercial vehicle, regardless of size, can be directed to the CVDG at the discretion of the installation entry controller.

<DESC>This is an Amendment 01 to Pre-Solicitation Notice posted on Jul 05, 2006 under Solicitation Number N62473-06-T-3060 for commercially available overhaul of Outdoor Type, Skid Mounted 5000/6250kva (OA/FA) Transportable Substation within the Mobile Utilities Support Equipment (MUSE).  The Pre-Solicitation Notice Amendment 01 is posted to change the types of substation to be overhauled from two types, namely, the Electrical Systems Engineering (ESE) and the Golden Gate Systems (GGS) to one type, namely the Golden Gate Systems (GGS).  The statement of work’s objective on GGS type in the Pre-Solicitation Notice has been changed as follows:  The primary objective is to extend the life cycle of the GGS style substations within the MUSE inventory.  All components of the substation excluding the primary transformer and utility circuit breakers, shall be replaced with the new.  The primary transformer and utility circuit breakers shall be evaluated to determine the extent of refurbishment necessary.  Actual work to the transformer, and utility circuit beakers, shall be determined by results of evaluation. The end product shall closer resemble existing MUSE ESE style substations in design, layout, and component makeup; reducing inventory requirements.  The posting date of the solicitation and solicitation amendments unto the NAVFAC E-Solicitation Website at https://esol.navfac.navy.mil has been changed from 10 July 2006 to 20 July 2006.  All other information in the Pre-Solicitation Notice N62473-06-T-3060 posted in this website dated 05 July 2006 remains the same.

<SUBJECT>D -- Translation Of Patent And Non-Patent Documents From Any Foreign Language Into Standard American English
<SOLNBR>PROC0600172

<CONTACT>Ann Miller, Contract Specialist, Phone 571-272-4028, Fax 571-273-4028, Email ann.miller1@uspto.gov
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Scientific And Technical Information Center (STIC) intends to procure translation services (all languages) involving the translation of patent and non-patent documents from any foreign language into Standard American English with an estimated value of $8 to 10 million over five (5) years. This is a re-competition of the current translation services contracts held by Foreign Language Service (FLS) (Contract No. 50-PAPT-2-01001), Ralph McElroy & Assoc. (Contract No. 50-PAPT-2-01002), and Schreiber Translations (Contract No. 50-PAPT-2-01003) which expire October 31, 2006. The USPTO intends to make award by October 20, 2006. This procurement is open to qualified small businesses only and multiple awards are anticipated. The contract period is for approximately a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods. The first contract period is expected to commence on November 1, 2006. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541930. The translation services requirement will be to provide accurate, high-quality translations of 1) patent literature (patents, utility models, published patent applications, abstracts, etc.) and 2) non-patent literature (scientific and technical articles, legal documents, reports, letters, etc.). The material to be translated is primarily scientific and technical, can relate to any field, and is frequently difficult linguistically and in content. A partial translation of any given document may also be requested. The language mix and the flow rates fluctuate in the workload of the Translations Branch. Overall, the major portion of the work to be translated is Japanese and German. The target language of the majority of the translations will be English. Translation into foreign languages may be required from time to time. The USPTO reserves the right to issue task orders that may vary somewhat from the usual ordering procedures.
This acquisition will be conducted using the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) located at: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/acquproc.htm. Under PTAG, FAR Part 15 does not apply and “full and open competition” is replaced with “maximum reasonable competition” which authorizes the USPTO to conduct this acquisition using an “alternative streamlined contracting approach.” Pursuant to this approach, this synopsis shall serve as a high-level solicitation. Following receipt of responses to this synopsis/high-level solicitation, the USPTO will evaluate the initial responses and establish a competitive range limited to a predetermined number of not more than five offerors. Upon establishment of the competitive range, those top highest ranked offerors will be notified and instructed on the next phase of the procurement process that will be the release of a detailed Request for Proposal (RFP) to solicit additional information and obtain a more complete offer. As a result of the responses to this Synopsis/High-level Solicitation, those vendors who are determined not to be the most qualified will be advised and will not receive further consideration. The USPTO will evaluate vendors’ responses based on translator qualifications, quality control systems, past performance, and pricing criteria. The offerors will be ranked in terms of qualifications and highest probability to successfully fulfill the USPTO’s requirements. Ultimate source selections will be based upon a best value determination. The process will include submission of an initial capability statement to the USPTO, an evaluation and a down-select of vendors by the USPTO. The USPTO is soliciting Capability Statements from responsible sources that clearly establish their ability to meet or exceed the USPTO’s Translation Services Capabilities Requirement (CR). Interested offerors shall submit a capability statement describing their capability to satisfy the size, scope and characteristics of the requirements (maximum of 10 pages).  The response must address four specific areas: 

(1)	Translator Source and Qualifications (1 typewritten page maximum):
-	A description of the education and experience requirements of proposed translators; and
-	Source of translators (i.e. university, private industry, company employee, consultant or subcontractor). 

(2)	Quality Control Systems (2 typewritten pages maximum):
-	A description of the process you will use to ensure the accuracy of the translations. 

(3)	Past Performance and Experience (3 typewritten pages maximum):
-	Provide a description of previous or current commercial or federal contracts that demonstrate an ability to meet the USPTO’s requirements and describe their relevance to the USPTO’s effort in terms of similarity of nature of work performed, size and scope. Include the contract period of performance dates, method used to determine word count, dollar value, point of contact and phone number.

(4)	Pricing:
-	Provide the price for translation of 1000 words by CLIN for German and Japanese per Attachment 1. Pricing should be provided for each of the three (3) word count methods for the base year;
-	Comment in 2 typewritten pages or less on the completeness and validity of the line items and units of measure shown in the pricing schedule per Attachment 2; and
-	Identify in 2 typewritten pages or less any suggested changes to the statement of work, clauses, contract duration that may improve the quality and pricing under the proposed contract. 

Since all procurement-related documents will be released via the Internet, a mailing list and/or list of interested vendors will not be available. The USPTO anticipates awarding one or more contract(s) as a result of this competition. It is anticipated that the contract type will be a firm fixed price requirements contract. All relevant documents for this procurement will be posted on the USPTO website at the Internet address: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm. It is the responsibility of each prospective offeror to check the project web site regularly for amendments, questions and answers, and other pertinent information concerning the procurement. An offeror’s failure to check the website will not be a justifiable excuse for requesting an extension to the response due date. 

Questions should be forwarded via e-mail to Ann F. Miller @ ann.miller1@uspto.gov, and must be received by 2:00 p.m. (EDST) on Tuesday, July 25, 2006.  Questions received after this date will not be entertained.  Responses to questions will be posted on the USPTO website. 
Responses to this request should be forwarded via e-mail to Ann F. Miller @ ann.miller1@uspto.gov, and must be received no later than 2:00 p.m. (EDST) on Wednesday, August 2, 2006.

C.1. (BACKGROUND/SCOPE OF WORK)

The contractor is required to abide by the terms and conditions of the contract and is not to impose conditions on the Department of State.  Any issues or orders requiring clarification are to be addressed to the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) or the Contracting Officer (CO).

Revision 2: The Department of State hereby deletes the last sentence of section: C.1.7 (Contractor to Coordinate with Attorney through the Contracting Officer) and replaces it with the paragraph below. 

If legal proceedings ensue as a result of the sale of a property or if legal action is taken against a third party or parties for matters relative to the sale or related transactions, the contractor will assist the Department of State in data compilation and in providing information pertinent to the Department’s preparation for such proceedings.  If the contractor anticipates any administrative costs associated with providing such information, the contractor will inform the Department of State in advance of assessing charges for such assistance.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS), Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has a requirement for upgrade of their Honeywell Facility Management Monitoring System, to include all engineering, technicians, checkout and testing after installation.  Any equipment added in performance of upgrade must be compatible with Honeywell equipment currently being utilized in the building fire and security monitoring system.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the services and supplies  specified as a sole source from Honeywell, Inc., 1500 West 51st Street, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. THIS ANNOUCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; NO FORMAL RFQ WILL BE AVAILABLE.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH SYNOPSIS The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying a marking paint (Infrared (IR) Reflective Paint) that will allow MNF-W personnel utilizing Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) at night to observe a road repair patch  from a distance of 100 meters. This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements. Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public. The Government is primarily focused on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requiremen!  ts. If no such commercial/non-developmental items currently exist, the Government may entertain the procurement of developmental items based on the information received as a result of this market research. Information on capable sources are sought for the follow requirements:  1.  BACKGROUND.  Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attacks in Iraq are the primary cause of death of American troops in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  As a result, the Department of Defense (DoD) has initiated research to develop methods of combating the destructiveness of IEDs.  MCWL in conjunction MarCorSysCom Contracting Officials has awarded a contract to procure six CRAFCO Magnum Spray Injection Patching systems to make road repairs made by IED craters.  Anti-Iraqi Forces (AIF) often utilize the same crater to emplace new IEDs.  Currently, U. S. Marine forces from Multi National Forces-West (MNF-W) mark the road repair patch with orange paint in order to detect tampering.  The orange marking paint is nearly undetectable at night to locate due to current tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).  .     2. REQUIREMENTS. The NVG compatible marking paint must be a paint product applied by hand, either brush or hand-held spray.  The marking paint must be an Infrared (IR) reflective paint detectable with the use of NVGs aided by the assistance of an IR spotlight.  The IR marking paint must compatible with road materials such as concrete and asphalt.  Additionally the IR marking paint must be compatible with the CRAFCO emulsion tack coat.  The IR marking paint must be capable of withstanding wheeled highway road traffic and road temperatures  equivalent to that in IRAQ.  The IR reflective marking paint must be visible with the aid of a NVG and IR spotlight from a distance of no less than 100 meters.   Sources capable of fully satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessary information to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information should include: 1) identification of your company or organization, 2) your company's or organization's assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements, 3) business/contracts/marketing office point(s) of contact information, 4) notification of business size and/or special status and 5) any additional information that may be useful to the successful procurement of the requirements, if solicited. These expressions of interest shall adhere to a two (2) pages submission limit, plus commercial marketing information or web links and all should be submitted via email to Ira D. Patterson referencing the following tracking #9074. These should be submitted on or before 21 July 2006. This market research announcement should not be consid!  ered a commitment of any kind by the Government and individual correspondence should not be expected in advance of any resulting pre-solicitation notice for the proposed requirements.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  
This is not an RFP, but a survey to locate potential sources capable of performing the proposed work.  It is anticipated that a Contractor will be required for the Development of Performance Based Seismic Design (PBSD) Guidelines, specifically the completion of Phase 3: Development of Seismic Performance Assessment Methodology and Guidelines and the initiation of Phase 4: Development of Performance Based Seismic Design Guidelines. Phases 1 and 2 are in the process of being completed under contract number EMW-2001-CO-0378 with the Applied Technology Council. 
 
DEFINITION:   
Performance Based Seismic Design (PBSD) is a concept that permits the design and construction of buildings with a realistic and reliable understanding of the risk of life, occupancy and economic loss that may occur as a result of future earthquakes or other significant loading events.  PBSD is based on an evaluation of a building’s design to determine the probability of experiencing different types of losses, considering the range of potential earthquake events that may affect the facility.  The desired performance level for a structure, along with a specified level of seismic shaking, are defined at the initiation of the structure’s design process. The decision-maker would select one or more of these performance levels, and an input ground motion event or hazard level for which this performance is to be achieved.  The designer would then utilize a PBSD assessment procedure that is intended to allow for the determination as to whether these various performance levels are met or exceeded for the selected design hazard.  Following the PBSD process, the building design would then be adjusted until the performance assessments indicate a risk of loss that is deemed acceptable by the building owner or regulator.  Work under this project will include several sets of tasks, including: Structural Performance Products Tasks, which relate to verifying the performance of structural systems including development of response, damage and loss functions for various structural systems; Nonstructural Performance Product Tasks, which relate to verifying the performance of nonstructural components and systems including development of response, damage and loss functions for these components and systems; Risk Management Product Tasks, which relate to integrating the structural and nonstructural performance functions against the ground shaking intensity hazard to obtain estimates of performance in terms of probable repair & replacement costs, probable life losses, and probable loss of occupancy and use of buildings, as well as development of means of expressing these risks to stakeholder /decision makers; and Guidelines Development Tasks, which relate to developing engineering procedures that guide the engineer in how to implement the performance verification methodology.  Because the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) is national in scope, the development of performance-based seismic design guidance must be done in a manner that will be acceptable by the engineering and design communities and model building code organizations.   

REQUIREMENTS:  
Phase 3 will result in the publication of Guidelines for Performance Assessment, which could be used directly to evaluate the performance of new and existing structures by applying standard methods of structural analysis coupled with structural reliability/loss estimation methods.  Phase 4 will be the development of guidelines for identifying the selection of appropriate systems, configurations, strengths, stiffness, ductility and other characteristics appropriate to meeting performance of different types, in regions of varying seismicity. Such an undertaking will require contracting with a nationally recognized engineering developmental organization that is intimately familiar with this issue and its history, is able to bring together the nation’s leading experts in all of the related fields, has demonstrated extensive experience working with both nation’s engineering and design professionals as well as representatives from the user communities, and demonstrated extensive experience working with the development of design and construction standards and codes throughout the country.  

MINIMUM CAPABILITIES: 
Minimum capabilities must include documented evidence of experience and expertise in all of the following areas: 
(1) Demonstrated experience in assembling teams of national experts from the many various disciplines needed to develop performance-based design and engineering tools for new construction; 
(2) Demonstrated experience in assembling teams of national experts from many disciplines needed to develop performance-based design and engineering tools for the upgrade of existing structures; 
(3) Demonstrated experience in assembling, coordinating, and managing large technical projects in an efficient and timely manner; 
(4) Demonstrated experience in attracting and working with the future users of performance based seismic design technology, specifically including building owners and managers, financial organizations, legal representatives, insurance companies, and State and local regulators; 
(5) Demonstrated experience in the development of usable technical resource documents and engineering applications to mitigate the effects of all hazards on the built environment; and, 
(6) Demonstrated experience in assembling teams of national experts from a large number of fields, specifically including structural engineering, architecture, geo-technical engineering, mechanical engineering, systems engineering, and non-structural engineering.  

RESPONSE:   
Firms with these capabilities are invited to submit complete information to the procuring office identified in this notice in three (3) copies within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this notice.  Information furnished should include: (1) the number and professional qualifications of scientists, engineers, technical and other appropriate personnel; (2) company experiences related to the proposed project; (3) a description of general and special facilities; (4) a current financial statement; and (5) other literature which demonstrates minimum capabilities listed above.

<SUBJECT>U -- US Air Force Academy Flight Screening Program
<DESC>Industry Week to support US Air Force Academy for the Academy Flight Screening program.

The Air Force anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal for contracted flight screening at the US Air Force Academy (USAFA).  The Air Force intends to conduct an Industry Week during the week of 14-18 August 2006.  During this week, the Air Force will provide briefings explaining in detail the concept of operations of the flight screening program.  This will include tours of the facilities that will be utilized by the future contractor for both operations and maintenance.  Potential offerors will be given the opportunity to present a short (30 minutes or less) briefing to the Air Force highlighting their company capabilities as they pertain to the flight screening program and ask questions of the Air Force concerning the draft Performance Work Statement that will be posted prior to this event.  Most importantly, the Air Force wishes to qualify aircraft for this proposal.  For aircraft to be considered for the flight screening program, capability to meet required standards must be demonstrated during this event.  Due to the unique environmental conditions at the USAFA at this time of year, qualification evaluations can only be conducted during this week.  Offerors on contract flight screening at the Air Force Academy may only propose use of aircraft which have demonstrated the capability to meet the required standards. 

This qualification is to ensure safety by validating aircraft performance and operational capability in the high density altitude environment of the USAFA present during this timeframe.  Evaluation of the aircraft based on standards listed below will be on a pass/fail basis.  Aircraft must meet all standards in order to receive a “pass” rating.  The pass/fail results of the testing will be provided to the manufacturer/offeror seeking qualification.  A list of aircraft receiving a passing rating will be posted on FedBizOps and included in the forthcoming RFP for flight screening at the USAFA.  

The required standards are as follows: 

Aircraft will be FAA certificated for normal category or higher.  Any new aircraft not previously certified must be certified prior to proposal submission.

<SUBJECT>R -- Screening Partnership Program
<DESC>DESCRIPTION
THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (TSA) IS SEEKING COMMENTS/QUESTIONS ON THE ATTACHED DRAFT AIRPORT PASSENGER AND BAGGAGE SECURITY SCREENING SERVICES SOLICITATION WHICH INCLUDES ALL EFFORTS ASSOCIATED WITH RECRUITMENT, ASSESSMENT, CREDENTIALING, AND TRAINING.  This draft solicitation, along with other related program data, will also be posted on TSA’s website at www.tsa.gov by accessing the Screening Partnership Program (SPP) link.  

BACKGROUND
The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) P.L. 107-71 required TSA to assume responsibility for passenger and baggage security screening operations at the nation’s airports by November 19, 2002.   49 U.S.C. § 44920 (ATSA §108) provides, in part, that TSA shall allow an airport operator to submit an application to have screening carried out by the screening personnel of a qualified private screening company. 

APPROACH   
Once an airport application has been submitted, TSA will release a formal RFP for each approved SPP airport.  This airport-specific solicitation will outline all contract requirements, with special emphasis on meeting all ATSA statutes.  Previously, offerors had to go through a two-step phased competitive effort in order to be placed on the Qualified Vendors List (QVL) which resulted in the award of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs).  All QVL members could then participate in the third step which allowed them to compete for Airport Task Orders.  This three-step process was very time consuming.  In order to reduce the overall procurement lead time for awards, TSA has incorporated all three steps into a one-step process.  The result of the RFP will be a single award to the offeror that provides the best value to the Government.  Additionally, Category III and IV airport may be set-aside for small business competitions.  

While awaiting airport applications, TSA has chosen a proactive approach by releasing this draft RFP in order to reduce the question and answer period once a formal RFP has been released.  

Please note that this draft RFP IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INDUSTRY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTICIPATED UPCOMING REQUIREMENTS.

POINT OF CONTACT:
All comments/questions shall be forwarded to: Scott Bishop via email:   Scott.Bishop@dhs.gov not later than August 1, 2006.  The comments/questions should be submitted in the same format as shown in Section L.5 of the draft RFP.

2.  What portions of this PWS would you change if you had the chance?
3.  Are the accreditation or standards achievable in Iraq?  If no, why not?
4.  What are the challenges or difficulties that have not been adequately addressed?
5.  Are there cost areas that have not been addressed in the matrix?
6.  Is there any feedback that you wish to give for this PWS?
7.  If non-US accreditation standards or certifications were used, would this impact on the ability to obtain reimbursement from insurance companies?  If yes, why?
8.  Do you have an alternative approach or concept of operations to meet the same requirement?  If yes, what is it?
9.  Would your company be interested in participating if the Government did not provide any logistical support, but permitted your company to purchase logistics support from Government sources or acquisition vehicles?
10.  What are the top ten risks associated with this acquisition?  How would we mitigate these risks, if they have not already been mitigated in this PWS?
11.  Do you think the allowable charges that insurance companies will reimburse will be acceptable for the successful offerror on this Contract PWS?   If no, why?  Which insurance companies?  Defense Base Act insurance fee schedules versus non DBA fee schedules?
12.  If your company is not interested in this requirement based on the current PWS, what changes, if any, would induce you to participate in this requirement solicitation?
13.  Do you have any rough estimates for annual costs if a.  the government would provide all payments up front?  b.  The contractor would seek reimbursement and the Government would pay if non-payment exceeded specified standards?  c.  The contractor covered all costs and the Government merely provided access to its facilities, logistics sources (for reimbursement) and contracting vehicles.  d.  Government provided life support only and Contractor covers costs associated with the service and allowed the Contractor access to its contracting vehicles or logistics sources.  Please add another scenario if desired.  If you wish the Government to pay or be responsible for medical support costs in some degree, explain why you believe this is absolutely necessary and why the Government cannot recover all of the costs for providing medical care for Contractors per US Government and DOD policy.
14.  Are there any issues or changes related to the physical examinations and OSHA like services that the Government would in fact pay for on a non-reimbursable basis?
15.  Are there any additional services that should be included?  (if yes, why?)

STATEMENT OF WORK

Title of Project: CESAREAN SECTION:  HERPES/STD SUPPLEMENT


C.1  Background and Need 
Based on the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), 27% of live birth deliveries in Genital herpes was recorded as a factor in 4.2 per 1000 CS deliveries (0.4%) in 1979, rising to 15.9 per 1000 (1.6%) in 2003.  Among primary CS deliveries (i.e., in women who had not undergone CS in a previous pregnancy) that were undertaken without a trial of labor, the proportion linked to herpes (per 1000 live births) rose from 12.0 in 1979 to 50.5 in 2003.  By contrast, for all live births, herpes was linked with only 1.1 and 12.3 per 1000 in 1979 and 2003, respectively.  The NHDS herpes data are based on ICD-9 coding, with all the imprecision that implies, and these figures do not speak directly to the indications for CS or the severity or nature of the herpes diagnosis.
Accordingly, the direct contribution of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection as a determinant of CS cannot be computed from these data.  However, an opportunity to directly investigate this association presents itself as a supplement to an existing project, soon to begin, wherein 3,000 pregnant women and their obstetrical providers will be enrolled in a prospective survey to study the determinants of CS.  The parent study also offers the opportunity to determine the frequency with which pregnant women are screened for STDs in accordance with guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and to correlate the findings with providers’ understanding of the guidelines.

C.2  Project Objective 
The overall goals of this supplemental pilot study are to assess the association of various indicators of herpes-related knowledge and morbidity with CS versus vaginal delivery; to evaluate providers’ attitudes and knowledge about genital herpes, perinatal transmission of HSV, and its prevention; to prospectively determine the frequency and predictors of routine STD screening of pregnant women; and to generate preliminary data in preparation for expanded prospective  research proposals (e.g., RO-1 other mechanisms) using similar recruitment and survey methodology.

C.3  Scope of Work – 
The survey will be undertaken in 3,000 pregnant women in 4 areas of the country (concentric urban, suburban, and rural settings centered on Seattle, St. Louis, Baltimore, and Raleigh-Durham) who will be followed prospectively through their deliveries.  Recruitment is designed to approximate a population-based sample of pregnant women in whom the incidence of CS versus vaginal delivery will be prospectively determined.  The patients will be recruited and interviewed during the third trimester (TM3), and again post-partum, to evaluate numerous determinants of CS.  In addition, all patients’ obstetrical providers will be interviewed to assess attitudes and beliefs about CS; and there will be a post-partum medical record review to further assess numerous potential determinants.  Finally, the patients’ obstetrical and delivery records will be reviewed and standardized data abstracted.  
The primary study will classify CS as medically determined versus elective, with recognition that these determinants are subject to interpretation.  For example, what degree of cephalopelvic disproportion operates as an absolute determinant of CS, compared with lesser degrees that might interact with predictors of “elective” CS?  Is there a correlation between pregnant women’s desire to limit vaginal and perineal trauma, as one possible determinants of elective CS, with clinical indications on the other hand that might justify CS under medical grounds?  Are CS or vaginal delivery related to socioeconomic characteristics or insurance status?
The primary study was not designed to address genital herpes or other STD issues.  However, this project offers a unique and cost-efficient opportunity to prospectively address the associations of various direct and indirect indicators of genital HSV infection with pregnancy outcome.  It also offers an opportunity to prospectively assess obstetrical providers’ awareness of STD screening recommendations (e.g., CDC, ACOG) in pregnant women and to prospectively evaluate compliance with those recommendations and numerous determinants of STD screening in pregnancy

C.4  Technical Requirements 
•	Finalize herpes/STD supplement questionnaire and incorporate the inputs from CDC project officers
•	Obtain IRB approval of the herpes/STD supplement at all study sites 
•	Interview 3,000 pregnant women during 3rd trimester and again post-partum using the herpes/STD supplement questionnaire   
•	Interview the obstetrical providers at the participating sites for the 3,000 pregnant women using the herpes/STD supplement questionnaire.
•	Complete medical review of the 3,000 pregnant women and complete the medical chart abstraction portion of the herpes/STD supplement questionnaire                               
•	Complete data entry and editing, and share data with CDC project officers to allow for joint analyses by CDC project officers and contractor researchers to address the study objectives


C.5  Reporting Schedule 
The contractor should submit a brief reporting every quarter during the course of the study.  The format can either be a paragraph narrative or a table (one page) that summarizes study progresses, including cumulative and the progress made in the preceding 3 months.

C.6  Special Considerations  
•	CDC IRB will not review the entire research protocol and will rely on Battelle IRB for human subject review. 
•	Manuscripts that are authored and co-authored by CDC project officers must obtain CDC clearance before submitting for publication

<DESC>Questions and Answers Regarding USCG Solicitation HSCG23-06-R-DPP035

The following list contains the questions received from Offerors since Amendment 3 to the solicitation was posted on July 12, 2006, and includes the specific response for each question.

1. Section 5.2 of Amendment #2 refers to "Coast Guard approved methodology and analysis SOP". What is the methodology and SOP?

Answer: There are Coast Guard Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for course development, analysis, and evaluations that describe the general contents and formats for the report documents that are generated through course reviews. This specific information will be provided to the Contractor at the contract Kick Off meeting. Under this contract the Coast Guard expects the Contractor to provide standard course tests, course evaluations, and summaries of the course evaluations within one month following the ending date of the course. The purpose is to assess the quality of the learning environment through student reactions, and to assess the learning that has occurred in a course of instruction.

2. Given adequate notification, may the contractor rotate Project Managers and alternates throughout the year with USCG approval?

Answer: The Program Manager position is a Key personnel position.  There are provisions in the FAR clause for replacement of a Key Personnel under the contract.

3. Will computer LCD projectors, screens, flipcharts, felt pens and other classroom instructional equipment be provided by the USCG?

Answer: The Contractor is responsible for providing all course materials, equipment, and supplies for providing the courses and services under this contract.

4. Will DHS/USCG pay for security clearances for contractor personnel?
 
Answer: The Contractor is responsible for all costs associated with providing their personnel with security clearances.

5. Will the USCG facilitate obtaining (their) required security clearances for contractor personnel in time to meet proposed training schedules? Will the schedule be coincided with contractors obtaining security clearances?

Answer: The specific needs for security clearances will be discussed at the contract kick Off meeting. Currently, it’s anticipated that Contractor personnel will only require clearances for Sensitive Security Information (SSI) clearances which are based on local records checks and can be accomplished in a relatively short period of time. The Coast Guard will provide the Contractor with the specific information and points of contact needed to process Contractor staff for these clearances, but the Contractor is responsible for all administrative efforts and expenses required to obtain security clearances for their personnel.

6. Are the teaching materials/books/presentation aids to be included in the cost of the program or are they supplied by the CG?

Answer: The Contractor is responsible for providing all course materials needed to present these courses (student workbooks, binders, teaching materials, presentation aids, etc.) except for the Incident Management Handbook which will be provided by the Coast Guard.

7. Do you have an expected date for releasing the answers to all contractor questions, as the proposal due date is quickly approaching?

Answer: Answers to collected Offeror questions were released under Amendment 3 to the solicitation. This Amendment was posted to the FedBizOpps website on July 12, 2006. The final, follow on set of questions and answers from Offerors are contained herein.

8.  Question #12 provides the information about the projected locations of the courses. However, it does not provide which course(s) will be taught at those locations. The ICS courses vary in length from 1 to 5 days. The length and location of the course will impact the pricing of per diem, etc. Accordingly, could you please advise which course will be taught at which location? 

Answer: This list is representative of the travel required to present the courses under this contract. The upcoming year’s training schedule for NIMS/ICS specific courses and locations has not yet been finalized and Offerors shall estimate the travel expenses based on the information that was provided in the solicitation and subsequent amendments.

9. Are the teaching materials/books/presentation aids to be included in the cost of the program or are they supplied by the CG?

Answer: See answer 6 above.
10. Do you have an expected date for releasing the answers to all contractor questions, as the proposal due date is quickly approaching?

Answer: See answer 7 above.

11. Due to the level of details required in response to the answers to the contractor questions and the length of time required to incorporate the changes into our proposal, would you consider an extension to the proposal due date? 

Answer:  Per the Solicitation, Offeror proposals are due no later than 2:00 p.m. on July 19, 2006. The clarifications provided in the Solicitation Amendments, which includes the ceiling prices for travel, will enable Offerors to provide responsive proposals by this time and date for this very critical training services procurement.

AMENDMENT 01 DATED JULY 14, 2006

Amendment 01
Request for Quotations (RFQ) 60044
Spanish Translation of Neurological Topic Brochures

For ease of vendors, common questions have been combined.

1.	We are very interested in participating in the above referenced RFQ. We were only ably to find a limited amount of information (included below) and would like to receive the complete bid package. Could you please provide a copy of the bid package or some direction to guide us through the process?

The entire bid and solicitation is contained in the synopsis.  

2.	I would also like to ask you if the Spanish translations will be used in the US, Spain or any specific country in Latin America. This will allow us to determine who the best translators will be for this project.  Are they targeted to Spanish speakers in the United States or in another country?  If so, which country?   Who is the target audience for the brochures?  Are they intended for the general public, medical professionals, etc.?

The brochures are intended for Spanish speakers in the US.  The translations should be understandable by anyone fluent in Spanish, regardless of country or origin.  The target audience can be health professionals or laypersons. 


3.	Are there any limitations to sub-contracting out this language translation service?

Pursuant to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, 

(b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for— 
(1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. 

4.	I was wondering if NINDS (NIDA) has a need for the contractor to provide desktop publishing for the brochures or if the institute has its own DTP personnel who will be responsible for ensuring that the translated text is incorporated into the brochure.  Will formatting also be involved? Is there any formatting or desktop publishing involved in this project?  

Currently, the NINDS does not need a desktop publisher.
 
5. 	Is it known how available the POC for the project will be in the event there are questions from the project management staff?
 
The POC will be available to review the documents once completed. 

6. How many pages do you want to see for each sample of previous work?

There is no page limit on the samples.

7.	Reading it over, we notice that the evaluation of bids is based on 1) Prior experience (35 points), 2) delivery of translations free of typos (30 points), and 3) meeting deadlines (15 points). These add up to 80 points. What are the remaining 20 points based on?

The Government acknowledges its 80 point scale and will maintain the 80 point scale.

8.	Is there a form that must be completed in addition to the
(2) sample documents?  Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items, with its offer. Clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Condition Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition
Where can we access the various provisions that are applicable to this RFQ?   With regard to the RFP response, will there be a specific format that we should follow? On the other clauses; 52.212-3 through 52.212-5, I have not found any space to write our information or signature.  Do, I simply print out and attach it to our proposal without putting any information?   Is there a specific format that the proposal should be submitted or is there a form to fill in?

All the provisions can be found at www.arnet.gov/far.  The provision of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-2 need not be submitted since it is instructions to the offerors.  FAR 52.212-3 is to be completed and submitted.  FAR 52-212-4 and 5 need not be submitted.
 
Standard Form 1449 is to be completed in addition to the provisions.  Additional text in addition to the form should be submitted so that the sufficient information can be submitted in order to evaluate proposals against the stated evaluation criteria. A copy of the SF 1449 can be found on the GSA website under GSA Forms Library.  http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?formType=SF


9.	Has it page limitation and hoe many hard copies shall we submit?

There is no page limit.

10.	Would it be possible to see a sample of these brochures? If the institute uses existing templates for the brochures, have they been localized (culturally adapted) to the target audience?


The sample brochures are available upon request.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION REQUIREMENT:  	REQ 26 &amp; 27 - Network Appliance PROGRAM:	IT Operations, 005N JUSTIFICATION: Purchase of the Network Appliance is justified in order to leverage existing Network Appliance infrastructure. This is a contingency solution and an add-on to existing architecture.  By using the same architecture, we will be able to add to the existing Network Appliance near-store and long-term storage systems already in place at  the Falling Waters facility.  We will also be able to mirror the millions of log files stored in Falling Waters required for tracking and research to an Alternate Site.  Use of the same architecture is necessary to efficiently accomplish the mirroring task, in addition to centralized management and monitoring of the system.
