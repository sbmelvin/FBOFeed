<DESC>Description
The Department of Health and Human Services, National Vaccine Program Office, contemplates single or multiple awards of a contract for a domestically produced, reliable and secure source of cell based monovalent influenza vaccine for use in an influenza pandemic.

Because this could be an issue of health security for any country and that local supplies of influenza vaccine might be reserved for local populations, as an issue of health security the U.S. government is limiting manufacture of the pandemic influenza virus vaccine to domestic sources only.  This would allow the USG to have surge capacity for U.S. citizens in the setting of a global influenza pandemic
 
The following apply:

1.	Documented history of successful development and licensure of a vaccine for human use in the U.S. or Europe is mandatory.
2.	The research and development process and manufacturing facilities needed to satisfy regulatory requirements of the FDA.
3.	The pandemic virus will be a novel strain, such as the avian influenza viruses (H5N1) that infected people in Hong Kong in 1997 and in China in 2003, or the H7N7 strain that caused infections in Belgium and the Netherlands in 2003.

Only written requests, directly from the requestor, will be accepted.  Email requests will be accepted.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Requests should reference the solicitation number, state the name of the firm, name of the requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address.  Requests should be mailed to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ATTN:  Peter Penny, 2920 Brandywine Road, Room 3705, Atlanta, GA  30341.  Emails should be sent to Peter Penny at pmp7@cdc.gov.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the previous announcement dated March 2, 2005.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is leading the national effort to revise the 1996 Guidelines for the Death Scene Investigation of Sudden, Unexplained Infant Death and the Sudden, Unexplained Infant Death Investigation Report Form (SUIDIRF).  The SUIRDIF is used nationally by states, counties and local jurisdictions on a voluntary basis to gather information about the circumstances surrounding sudden, unexplained infant deaths (SUIDS).  The SUIRDF is important because it provides a standardized system for the death scene investigation of SUIDS.  Lack of such standardization results in inaccurate diagnosis and reporting of the cause of death and thus hinders the ability to monitor trends in SUIDS, conduct meaningful research, and monitor programs aimed at preventing SUIDS.  To improve the diagnosis and reporting of SUIDS in the US, all death scene investigators need to have access to and familiarity with the form, as well as training on how to conduct the a SUIDS death scene investigation.  Therefore, the CDC, Maternal and Infant Health Branch (MIHB) is seeking the services of an experienced contractor to train coroners, medical examiners and all of those involved with infant death scene investigations to conduct and infant death scene investigation using the revised SUIRDF and related training material.  However, to the best of our knowledge, only Occupational Research and Assessment (ORC), Inc. located in 124 Elm Street, Big Rapids, MI  49307 is knowledgeable with the revised SUIDIRF.  The revised SUIRDF was created in 2004 by a national committee.  ORC already developed a curriculum for training materials with the new form and for infant death scene protocol.  However, any interested party who believes to have the capability to provide the training required by this RFP may reply submit an expression of interest via e-mail to Bbiltz@cdc.gov  or may send a proposal in response to the solicitation.   All responsible sources  will be considered.  The tentative solicitation issue date is 4/18/2005.  The solicitation will be available for downloading at the FedBiz Opps website when issued. No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed. PLEASE SUBMIT ALL INQUIRIES ONLY BY E-MAIL.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  The NAICS codes is 541710 and the small business size standard is $6 million.  It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFO on the FedbizOpps website.  See numbered note 1.

"	Proposed Issue Date: On or about April 19, 2005. "	Title of Project:  Restore Raspberry Island Light Station, Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Bayfield County, Wisconsin "	Description:  The project concerns the rehabilitation of a historic lighthouse on Raspberry Island at Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, a unit of the National Park system located in northern Wisconsin.  The island is located in Lake Superior northwest of Bayfield, Wisconsin.  Although the title of this project is "Restore Raspberry Island Light Station" the focus of the project is rehabilitation of the lighthouse itself. The project includes related utilities (water, wastewater, and power) and site work. The lighthouse was configured as a duplex in order to provide separate quarters for the lighthouse keeper and one or two assistant keepers.  The light is now automated, and there are no lighthouse keepers on the island. The project purpose is to rehabilitate the lighthouse for adaptive use.

<DESC>This is a synopsis being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the March 2005 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2001-27.  This acquisition is NOT small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 923120.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional support services for the National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR) on a sole source basis from the Association of Schools of Public Health (ASPH).  NICHSR plans to provide support to ASPH to update and improve the functionality of the Distance Learning Information contained in ASPH's website.  The purpose of this agreement is to strengthen and direct the pipeline leading to a well-trained public health workforce.  The schools of public health serve as an educational resource to the public health community, and since public health content is constantly evolving, lifelong education is crucial to those working in public health.  Education in the form of distance learning is particularly valuable to these professionals, because they are geographically widespread and in need of flexible learning systems that can be scheduled around other professional commitments.  ASPH has developed and supported several modes of working with the schools of public health in the area of distance learning to support and advance the mission of providing quality distance learning within the schools.  These include: 1) Establishment of Academic Distance Learning Coordinators (ADLCs), comprised of one representative at each school who focuses on distance learning and its issues; 2) Support of the ASPH Distance Education (DE) and Continuing Professional Education (CPE) Councils, who meet annually to discuss issues of distance learning in public health, and whose core members are Academic Distance Learning Coordinators.  VALUATION CRITERIA:  The technical proposal will receive paramount consideration over price of cost factors.  The evaluation will be based, in addition to price, on a written quotation detailing the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective vendor in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the Statement of Work.  Offerors must submit information sufficient to allow the NLM to evaluate the following criteria for award.  Criterion A:  (50 points) - Vendor must have established contact with the Academic Distance Learning Coordinator from the 36 schools of public health.  And vendor shall also have established contact with the Continuing Professional Education Council.  Criterion B:  (50 points) - Vendor must have a project managers with a Master of Public Health (MPH) and a Master of Education (MEd).  This requirement is for a twelve (12) month period.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM.  The quoter shall include all information which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation.  The Statement of Work (SOW) of this requirement is available to download at NLM Small Purchases (Simplified Acquisitions) web site: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/oam/oam.html.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order.  Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR): http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site: FAR 52.213-4, Terms and Conditions-Simplified Acquisitions (Other Than Commercial Items) (January 2005).

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for material research to identify a promising solid-state joining process that will allow refractory metals and Ni-base superallys to be welded.  The requirement is as follows:  NASA will provide the materials. Vendor requirements and deliverables contained in subtasks. Length of time for contract:  3 months Final Report required. T-111 is a tantalum alloy. 1. Inertia Welding We are considering providing ½ diameter rod for each of the materials listed below to be welded in the following combinations: –	Mo 47Re to Hastelloy X –	T-111 to Hastelloy X –	Mo 47Re to Mar M247 cast and heat treated (coarse cast grain) –	T-111 to Mar M247 cast and heat treated (coarse cast grain) –	Mo 47Re to Mar M247 micro-cast and heat treated (fine cast grain) –	T-111 to Mar M247 micro-cast and heat treated (fine cast grain) (Note:	Difficulty welding coarse grain M247 would cause it to drop out of test matrix) We would like six specimens for each metal combination to be used for: 1 - Exhibit piece to pass around the office and meetings 2 - Section, as-welded, for metallographic evaluation   3 - 1,000 hr (TBD) thermal exposure specimen 4 - 5,000 hr (TBD) thermal exposure specimen  5 - Combined with Magnetic Pulse exhibit piece 6 - Combined with Magnetic Pulse for metallographic evaluation 2. Magnetic Pulse Welding We would like to form a refractory tube over the ½ inch diameter superalloy rod to demonstrate that this is also a practical alternative.	We are trying to obtain stock refractory tube in the range of 1/2 to 5/8 inch inside diameter and 0.060 to 0.100 inch wall thickness.  We will machine the internal rod diameter to create the required gap to the specification you will provide once we obtain the tube.  We would like two specimens for evaluation for each of the following combinations: –	Mo 47Re tube to Hastelloy X rod –	T-111 tube to Hastelloy X rod –	Mo 47Re tube to Mar M247 rod –	T-111 tube to Mar M247 rod –	Mo 47Re tube to inertia welded rod (Mar M247 to Mo 47Re) –	T-111 tube to inertia welded rod (Mar M247 to T-111) 3. Electro-Spark Deposition (ESD) We would like to examine specimens joined by ESD.  Because of the manual method you will likely use and the slow deposition process, we are intentionally limiting our observations to a few small “sheet” specimens.	For convenience, we chose a sheet tensile specimen which for some of the materials is already available.	We suggest cutting a tensile specimen in half at the center of the gage section and joining the two dissimilar materials.  The reduced cross section is nominally 0.250 inch wide and 0.020 inch thick.  We would like three specimens: 1) exhibit piece, 2) section as-welded for metallographic evaluation 3) 1,000 hr (TBD) thermal exposure specimen or RT tensile specimen for the following material combinations: –	Mo 47Re strip to Mar M247 strip –	T-111 strip to Mar M247 strip NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items/services from the Edison Welding Institute, Inc, of Columbus, Ohio.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source (U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)).  Due to EWI's unique qualifications and historical experience, their leadership in R&D involving magnetic pulse welding, inertia welding and electro-spark facilities in-house, it enables them to make critical examiniations and decisions toward both material and process optimization. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 04/08/2005.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation desires to contract for a business process re-engineering effort along with the design, development, testing, and implementation of a consolidated financial accounting system.  The current Core Accounting System, which is comprised of a Financial Reporting System, Performance Accounting System (governmental accounting) and Trust Accounting System (non-governmental accounting), relies heavily on manual processes to capture and maintain much of its data.  PBGCs goal is to replace these three core financial systems, establish interfaces with subsidiary and non-core systems, reduce the expense and delays involved with the aging systems and outmoded businesses processes and provide an on-line (real time) transaction-based system.  The contract effort may extend to a number of non-core system areas such as procurement.  The system will utilize Oracle Federal Financials, including, but not limited to, the General Ledger, Accounts Payable and the Accounts Receivable components.  Visit www.pbgc.gov for information regarding the Corporation.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about April 22, 2005 with award of a contract projected before the end of fiscal year 2005.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration by the PBGC.

<DESC>The U. S. Railroad Retirement Board (“RRB”) is an independent Federal agency that administers a retirement and survivor benefits program for railroad employees and their families.  The RRB was established by the Railroad Retirement Acts of 1937 and 1974.  Its benefits program was the forerunner of the more familiar Social Security System.  The Railroad Retirement System is unique inasmuch as it is the only federally administered benefits program covering a single private industry.  The RRB also administers the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, which provides unemployment and sickness benefits to railroad employees.  The RRB’s headquarters, in which about 700 people are employed, is located in Chicago.  The RRB is seeking contractual support to convert its inventory of IDMS systems into a DB2/CICS environment.  The contractual support services shall include, but not be limited to, the conversion process, testing, knowledge transfer and migration.  RRB will issue an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel.: (703) 875-4357, 
Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Enrique Tafur, Gerente, Centro de Actividades Logísticas y de Transporte S.A. (CELTA S.A.), Calle 71-A  No. 6-30, Oficina 1001, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Tel.: +57 (1) 346-2966/+57 (1) 346-2999, Fax: +57 (1) 346-0027. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to assist Centro de Actividades Logísticas y de Transporte S.A (CELTA S.A.) in the design and development of the West Air Cargo Terminal project in Colombia.

The Feasibility Study is designed to support CELTA S.A. and its efforts to develop the Agricultural Products Inspection and Treatment Center project near Bogotá’s El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá.  The AgCenter project will be developed by CELTA S.A. at their industrial park 4 kilometers from the El Dorado International Airport, and at the edge of the agriculturally fertile “Savannah” region west of Bogotá.  The AgCenter project includes two inter-related components: the Integrated Perishable Agricultural Products Inspection and Treatment Facility and the El Dorado International Airport Access Road.  Overall, the project will encourage the diversification of agricultural exports from Colombia to include exotic fruits, vegetables, and herbs.  The “Savannah” agricultural region is currently dominated by fresh flower farms for the export market, along with traditional crops for local consumption such as corn and potatoes.

The inspection and treatment facility at the AgCenter is a $14 million project to be located at the CELTA industrial park.  The inspection and treatment facility would enable local farmers to comply with phytosanitary and security regulations necessary for the timely export of fresh produce and flowers through the use of phytosanitary treatment and cargo inspection systems.  The airport access road component of the AgCenter project would provide a direct link between the CELTA industrial park and the El Dorado International Airport.  The $2.4 million modernization of the airport access road would ensure the safe, secure, and rapid transport of air cargo from CELTA to the El Dorado International Airport.  Agricultural goods are produced in a region west of the airport known as the “Savannah.”  However, all vehicles transporting fresh produce and flowers for export have to travel through the city of Bogotá in order to reach the airport.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Feasibility Study include the following tasks:
Component 1 (Integrated Perishable Agricultural Products Inspection and Treatment
Center): 1.1) confirm U.S. and other international markets for exotic fruits, value-added vegetables, aromatics and flowers; 1.2) determine the optimum location to accommodate security and potential post-treatment contamination concerns; 1.3) confirm treatment, cold chain and security equipment needs; 1.4) determine facility and equipment plans; 1.5) prepare a technical, economic, and financial analysis of the facility and identify pieces of equipment; 1.6) determine whether airlines (perishable air cargo carriers) will permit final security clearance at the facility prior to aircraft loading; 1.7) determine the effect that U.S. Transportation Safety Administration regulations will have on cargo carrier security procedures; 1.8) develop a financing plan and evaluate the financial feasibility; 1.9) identify any legal and regulatory issues that must be resolved and confirm that all environmental regulations and standards are addressed; Component 2 (El Dorado International Airport Access Road): 2.1) review and evaluate the proposed route from the CELTA S.A. facility to the connecting point with the existing El Dorado International Airport roadway system; 2.2) determine the suitability of the existing roadway for improvement to a paved roadway capable of handling heavy truck traffic; 2.3) identify the engineering issues related to the completion of the Project that must be addressed; 2.4) confer with the Civil Aviation Authority and other related government entities to determine the terms and conditions necessary to obtain approval for the proposed roadway; 2.5) determine the terms and conditions for the use of the existing concrete bridge across the Bogotá River; 2.6) confer with Civil Aviation Authority and related Colombian government officials, CELTA S.A., and U.S. Embassy security specialists to determine necessary security requirements; 2.7) complete an analysis of the potential traffic utilization rate of this roadway by CELTA S.A. and agricultural producers in the western Bogotá Savannah; 2.8) develop a financing plan and evaluate the financial feasibility; 2.9) identify any legal and regulatory issues that must be resolved and confirm that all road construction and environmental regulations and standards are addressed; 3) development impact assessment; and 4) final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $304,260 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Enrique Tafur, Gerente, Centro de Actividades Logísticas y de Transporte S.A. (CELTA S.A.), Calle 71-A  No. 6-30, Oficina 1001, Bogotá, D.C., Colombia, Tel.: +57 (1) 346-2966/+57 (1) 346-2999, Fax: +57 (1) 346-0027. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to assist Centro de Actividades Logísticas y de Transporte S.A (CELTA S.A.) in the design and development of the West Air Cargo Terminal project in Colombia.

The Feasibility Study is designed to support CELTA S.A. and its efforts to obtain a concession to develop the West Air Cargo Terminal (WACT) project at the El Dorado International Airport that serves Bogotá.  The El Dorado International Airport is owned and operated by the Colombian civil aviation authority, AeroCivil.  Currently, there is only one air cargo terminal facility at the airport, which is a major air cargo transport center in South America.  The Government of Colombia (GOC) is in the process of concessioning the El Dorado International Airport and the Feasibility Study coincides with GOC efforts to privatize airport management and services.  The estimated $12-$14 million WACT would specialize in the handling of perishable agricultural products from the nearby savannah region.  As the sponsors of this project, CELTA S.A. would utilize the feasibility study to obtain a concession for the project.

While El Dorado International Airport is one of highest volume cargo transport centers in South America, its current air cargo handling capacity is reaching its limit.  The existing east air cargo terminal is already handling the air cargo volume that it was projected to handle in 2010.  The WACT would upgrade cross-docking capacity, cold chain management, and security controls and would allow for the expansion of total air cargo volume, potentially attracting new cargo carriers.  Specializing in the handling of perishable agricultural products, the WACT would also benefit farmers by improving the efficiency of loading perishable cargo onto aircraft.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Feasibility Study include the following tasks: 1) assess perishable cargo handling capacity and needs; 2) determine the appropriate capacity, location, and configuration of a computer-controlled conveyor and bar-coding system to direct cargo to the loading dock or to refrigerated storage; 3) assess and determine the cold chain and dry storage needs for perishables awaiting shipment; 4) assess airline security requirements; 5) confirm the final security inspection location; 6) determine the most appropriate location for the WACT and develop equipment plans; 7) prepare a technical, economic, and financial analysis and identify pieces of equipment; 8) determine the willingness of airlines to utilize the WACT facility; 9) develop a financing plan and evaluate the financial feasibility; 10) identify any legal and regulatory issues that must be resolved and confirm that all environmental regulations and standards are addressed; 11) development impact assessment; and 12) final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $196,950 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Description
The Department of Health and Human Services, National Vaccine Program Office, contemplates single or multiple awards of a contract for a domestically produced, reliable and secure source of cell based monovalent influenza vaccine for use in an influenza pandemic.

Because this could be an issue of health security for any country and that local supplies of influenza vaccine might be reserved for local populations, as an issue of health security the U.S. government is limiting manufacture of the pandemic influenza virus vaccine to domestic sources only.  This would allow the USG to have surge capacity for U.S. citizens in the setting of a global influenza pandemic
 
The following apply:

1.	Documented history of successful development and licensure of a vaccine for human use in the U.S. or Europe is mandatory.
2.	The research and development process and manufacturing facilities needed to satisfy regulatory requirements of the FDA.
3.	The pandemic virus will be a novel strain, such as the avian influenza viruses (H5N1) that infected people in Hong Kong in 1997 and in China in 2003, or the H7N7 strain that caused infections in Belgium and the Netherlands in 2003.

Only written requests, directly from the requestor, will be accepted.  Email requests will be accepted.  No telephone requests will be accepted.  Requests should reference the solicitation number, state the name of the firm, name of the requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address.  Requests should be mailed to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ATTN:  Peter Penny, 2920 Brandywine Road, Room 3705, Atlanta, GA  30341.  Emails should be sent to Peter Penny at pmp7@cdc.gov.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for  Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the  Government to form a binding contract.  This RFI excludes Classification Code  28 for F119 engines. SECTION I Description: Pre-solicitation Market research and Request for  Information (RFI) for an F/A-22 aircraft program Support Products Integrator  (SPI).  This RFI is intended to provide a forum to identify opportunities to  decrease F/A-22 sustainment costs, improve F/A-22 sustainment efficiency, and  increase sustainment readiness for F/A-22 customers.  The SPI is envisioned to  provide support integration experience, partnering, and air logistics center  investment strategies while continuously reducing overall sustainment costs.   Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning only, and shall not be  considered a RFP or IFB, an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to  acquire any products or services, or authorization to incur any cost in  anticipation of such authorization. The USG does not intend to award a contract  on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds the USG to pursue any  course of action described herein. If the USG chooses to issue a RFP at some  future date, another notice will be published. SECTION II Background: The F/A-22’s combination of stealth, supercruise,  maneuverability, and integrated avionics, coupled with improved supportability,  represents an exponential leap in warfighting capabilities and allows for the  full realization of operational concepts that are vital to the 21st century Air  Force. The F/A-22 is a critical component of the Global Strike Task Force that  is designed to project air dominance, rapidly and at great distances, to  counter and defeat threats that will attempt to deny access to USG forces. The  F/A-22 is an air superiority fighter that incorporates the latest technological  advances in reduced observables, avionics, engine performance and aerodynamic  design. Knowledge gained from proven weapon systems such as the F-15, F-16 and  F-117 formed the foundation for F/A-22 development. To ensure operational  flexibility, the F/A-22 shall have better reliability and maintainability than  any fighter aircraft in history.  Increased F/A-22 reliability and  maintainability pays off in less manpower required to fix the aircraft and the  ability to operate more efficiently.  Within the current environment, the F/A- 22 program is in Low Rate Initial Production and expected to enter Full Rate  Production within the next year, with initial operating capability anticipated  late 2005.  The F/A-22 System Program Office (ASC/YF) has identified a  potential need for a commercial or organic program to provide F/A-22 support  products integration starting in October 2007.  The F/A-22 support product  integration role is envisioned to remain as the USG’s F/A-22 long-term  sustainment philosophy, under a performance based logistics (PBL) acquisition.   PBL is the purchase of support as an integrated, affordable, performance  package designed to optimize system readiness and meet performance goals for a  weapon system through long-term support arrangements with clear lines of  authority and responsibility.  Simply put, performance-based strategies buy  outcomes, not products or services. The F/A-22 support products integration  contract will involve sustainment for approximately 177 aircraft, with a  potential for up to 381 aircraft.  SECTION III Purpose: The primary purpose of this RFI is to solicit technical  and business information from industry to aid in the definition and refinement  of requirements for the F/A-22 SPI as detailed below. Potential uses for the  information received may include development of requirements packages and  possible future solicitations. Additionally, the Government seeks input on the  data required to effectively estimate cost and perform the SPI role for the F/A- 22 Program.  Finally, this RFI provides the opportunity to participate in  further defining the SPI processes that will optimize F/A-22 logistical support  and determine the viability of industry or organic sources to provide the  services in the manner envisioned. SECTION IV Description: USG envisions a single point “Support Products  Integrator” (SPI) for F/A-22 sustainment.  The SPI will have a total weapon  system sustainment focus, and will be accountable through a series of  performance metrics.  Performance metrics will measure sustainment readiness  and equipment availability.  Further, the metrics requirements will be  incorporated into the contract and offer the SPI increased challenges over the  contract period.  The SPI will integrate both horizontally among prime  suppliers and vertically with smaller vendors to manage 1) depot maintenance  (to include reparable repairs, software maintenance, airframe repair and  modifications), 2) supply chain management (to include forecasting, purchasing,  inventory, and transportation), 3) product support (to include technical order  data and sustainment engineering).  Prime suppliers are anticipated to be  Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, the F/A-22 developer/manufacturer; the Boeing  company, for initial training sustainment; and organic government depots (all  three Air Force Air Logistics Centers and the Defense Logistics Agency).  In  short, the SPI will be responsible for F/A-22 supply chain management,  reparable repair management; aircraft depot maintenance/modification  management, support equipment maintenance and spares management, training  systems support integration, and F119 engine repair integration.   Initially,  the SPI will deal with current vendors to sustain the F/A-22.  The SPI will be  required to partner with the ALCs to obtain “core” capability requirements,  which is directed by public law.  The SPI will need to enable ALC repair  capabilities, associated ALC activation processes, and manage core workload as  core workloads are re-defined every two years. The SPI will rely on and develop  interfaces with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LMA) for LMA manufactured supply  support and repair, LMA developmental and manufactured support equipment,  technical order data and related information system data, and sustainment  engineering support. The USG will provide specifics on partnership  relationships, roles and responsibilities, performance metrics, fleet size,  Flying Hour Program (FHP), base locations, current vendors, points of contact  for vendors/suppliers, background information on 10 USC, 2464 Core  requirements, and security requirements.  The Air Force is formulating  requirements to acquire a full range of aviation related support services and  requests that interested parties respond to the respective questions for the  following support services/issues : (1) Potential SPI contract: What type of  contract do you recommend to perform the SPI requirements?  What SPI contract  term do you recommend?  What type of metrics do you recommend?  How do you  recommend measuring the metrics?  How do you recommend the metrics be included  in the contract?  What contract incentives do you recommend? (2) Supply chain  management and reparables:  The SPI will need to interface and understand  existing USG systems to successfully execute the SPI role.  For the supply  chain management and reparables, the systems envisioned are: the Core Automated  Maintenance System (CAMS); D035T for shipping items; D043A for master item  identification; the FEDLOG Database; D002A the standard base supply system;  D087 for weapon system management information system.  Given these systems,  what processes do you recommend to manage, forecast, and procure supply items?   What processes do you recommend to manage and update stock lists?  What  processes do you recommend to manage inventory and pipeline transportation?  What processes do you recommend to direct and manage vendor repair?  What  processes do you recommend to forecast reparable depot inductions? (3) Heavy  aircraft maintenance:  The SPI will need to understand and manage aircraft  heavy maintenance principles to successfully execute the SPI role.  For the  aircraft heavy maintenance, the principles are: analytical condition  inspections; unscheduled airframe maintenance (drop-in maintenance); airframe  surface strip and recoat; and airframe modifications.   Given these principles,  what processes do you recommend to integrate an effective aircraft modification  program?  What processes do you recommend to integrate aircraft analytical  condition inspections?  What processes do you recommend to integrate aircraft  paint stripping and repaint?  What processes do you recommend to integrate  unscheduled heavy aircraft maintenance?  (4) Support Equipment: The SPI will  need to interface and understand existing USG systems/services to successfully  execute the SPI role.  For the support equipment, the systems/services  envisioned are: the Master Item Identification Database, D043A; the Defense  Logistics Information Service; the Federal Logistics Information Service; the  Haystack Database; the Air Force Equipment Management System; and the Logistic  Support Analysis (LSA) database.   Given these systems/services, what processes  do you recommend to manage, forecast, and support equipment maintenance and  spare parts?  What processes do you recommend for identifying, documenting, and  approving support equipment (SE) requirements to include procurement through  delivery of assets?  (5) Training support: the contract in which training  systems are acquired and sustained for the USG will be managed by the Training  Systems Squadron, ASC/YW.  The current training system provider/sustainer is  the Boeing Company.  Under this structure, the SPI performs an integration  role.  What processes do you recommend to forecast and integrate training  sustainment requirements? What processes do you recommend to integrate aircraft  configuration change data for training impact analysis?  What processes do you  recommend to insure training devices are concurrent with the latest aircraft  configuration?  What processes do you recommend to assist the training team in  out year change planning and budgeting?  (6) Technical Order Data and related  information systems: The SPI will need to interface and understand existing USG  systems to successfully execute the SPI role.  For the technical order data,  the systems envisioned are: the Joint Computer Aided Logistics System (JCALS)  and the Enhanced Technical Information Management System (ETIMS).  The SPI will  be reliant upon LMA for technical order data and related information.  Given  this relationship and systems interface requirements, describe how you will  effectively integrate this SPI area?  What processes do you recommend to  integrate engineering data packages and drawings?  What processes do you  recommend to integrate Illustrated Parts Breakdown database and illustrations?  What processes do you recommend to integrate Logistics Support Analysis?  What  processes do you recommend to integrate change board and configuration  management products?

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Best Value-Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will be reviewing the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding their use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

All questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal can be addressed to the technical POC, Peter Rocci, telephone: (315) 330-4654 or email Peter.Rocci@rl.af.mil.  

Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION PHARMACY RETURNS/WASTE REMOVAL (REVERSE DISTRIBUTION) The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), provides health care to nearly 5 million patients through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical programs.  VHA currently administers and operates 7 Consolidated Mail Outpatient (CMOP) facilities, and 160 hospitals located in every state, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam.  The National Acquisition Center (NAC) is currently seeking DEA-registered sources to provide an efficient return goods processing service for VHA’s outdated pharmaceutical items, which includes both controlled and non-controlled substances.  Pharmaceutical Returns vendors would need the ability to provide the following: 1.  On-site processing at VA medical centers; i.e. inventorying, packing, and shipping of outdated pharmaceuticals to the vendor’s facility for processing.  This service would be required at a minimum once every 30 days for the 7 CMOP locations, and at a minimum every 90 days at the hospitals. 2.  Capability to provide a “real-time” electronic system or database that would allow VA customers to our facilities could access and view current to monitor status of their returns and manufacturers’ credits; i.e. whether returns have been returned to manufacturers or destroyed, and whether credits have been received.  Credits are to be applied to VA medical centers’ accounts at their contracted prime vendor distributor, which through the VA’s Pharmaceutical Prime Vendor, that is currently McKesson Health Care. 3.  Provide waste disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous products, in accordance with the EPA’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and any applicable Federal, State or local regulations. VA is conducting market research to determine whether it should award either one national contract, or regional contracts, depending on the capabilities of potential offerors to adequately service all VA facilities nationwide.  Firm-fixed price contracts for a two year base period and three (3) one-year option periods are contemplated.  The anticipated contract period will be a maximum of 5 years. This announcement is a sources sought notice for the purpose of market research.  Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for information planning purposes only.

Interested sources shall respond to this notice by providing the following at a minimum: 1.  General information regarding the services your company provides commercially, as well as your capabilities in regards to the general requirements stated above.  2.  VA is considering the placement of locked bins in the pharmacy areas for the storage of pharmaceutical products that are slated for destruction. Ideally, these bins would be designed in a way that would allow for any pharmacy worker to deposit products, but would not permit removal by government personnel. If your company provides something similar to this, please submit descriptive literature and information regarding the bins you provide. 3.  Please state whether your company accepts all Schedule drugs for processing. 4.  Describe and/or provide documents that describe your electronic system or database that permits your customers to check status of their returns and credits. . 6.  Information regarding your company’s business size, in terms of annual average receipts.

<DESC>Reference the Sources Sought Notice DADA09-05-T9001 issued DEC 22, 2004 to locate potential sources for the standardization of the pharmaceutical drug GABAPENTIN to secure best possible prices for the 45 Military Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) i n TRICARE Regions 6, 7, 8.  The Response Date has been extended to 29 APRIL 2005.   Products.  GABAPENTIN: Generic code 000780, 100 mg has an estimated annual usage of 11,336 bottles (11,298 bottles in 100 tabs and 38 in 50 tabs). Generic code 000781, 300mg has estimated annual usage of 43,259 bottles (42,945 bottles in 100 tabs and 314 i n 50 tabs). Generic code 000782, 400mg has an estimated annual usage of 6,773 bottles (6,734 bottles in 100 tabs and 39 in 50 tabs). Criteria. Each vendor must not only meet all FDA requirements related to pharmaceuticals, medications, and vaccines but als o meet or demonstrate compliance with the base criterion for this product line. These criterion include but are not limited to the following: (1) Clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug in appropriate populations. (2) Therapeutic  advantages and disadvantages relative to accepted therapy. (3) Cost-effectiveness relative to accepted therapy. (4) Clinical support and education programs to each MTF. (5) Customer support in the form of a sales representative for each MTF within TRICARE  Regions 6, 7& 8. (6) Unique NDC for each product. (7) Bar code labeling with NDC. (8) Existing FSS contract for each product and/or Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for providing reliable distribution and consistent availability through our DoD P harmacy Prime Vendors (Reg 6- Bergen; Reg 7&8- Cardinal and Dakota Drug) for all TRICARE Region 6, 7&8 facilities. (9) Quarterly utilization data collection support to the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO). (10) A company returns policy.  Selecti on.  A Clinical Product Team (CPT) will evaluate this product line. CPTs are composed of healthcare providers who have expertise and knowledge of the products and will review products and literature submitted.  TRICARE Regions 6, 7&8 deem the CPT members t o be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to determine and recommend which products are acceptable. The CPT recommendation can be based on literature review, presentation, demonstration, and physical or clinical evaluation.  Recommendations by t he CPT will be at the sole discretion of the experts selected to review any offering.  The drug(s) may or may not be listed on drug plan formularies, and recommendations may be deferred pending further information.  Pricing.  Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) can be exercised on the package size or bulk quantities deemed most advantageous to the Government.  Price is the most important factor, and items may be awarded as an aggregate.  Vendors are required to propose an incentive price in their submittal s for each line item listed to be considered for award.  Offerors must state the exact name (name that appears on label) by which the drug will be supplied and have a unique NDC number.  Offerors must provide bar code labeling which includes at a minimum t he NDC number.  Additionally, offerors are encouraged to provide the expiration date and lot number in the bar code.  Award will be made on the package size(s) most advantageous to the Government.  The awardee(s) will be required to permit lower prices by the DoD Pharmaceutical Prime Vendor (PPV) up front.  Any additional chargeback/rebate will be handled after the sale between the manufacturer and the appropriate DoD PPV.  The chargeback/rebate process must be transparent to the MTF customer.  The awardee( s) will permit the DoD PPV to load the lower discounted incentive price into their Electronic Order Entry System (EOES).  The MTF customer shall see the lower incentive price on the DoD PPV EOES screen.  Currently, neither Defense Medical Logistics Standar d Support (DMLSS), the Universal Data Repository (UDR) nor DSCP can loa d the regionally reduced prices.  Under no circumstances shall the awardee attempt to charge the MTF customer the non-RIA price (i.e., the higher initial price) and attempt to provide the price difference via a chargeback/rebate after the sale.  The awarde e(s) will assign a unique chargeback number to this Regional Incentive Agreement, to distinguish it from the original Government contract or other agreement price (i.e. FSS, DAPA, etc.).  Contact Mr. Hill by email to obtain the pricing excel spreadsheet fo rmat to be used.  Interested companies should provide Mr. Hill your company name, address, point of contact to address questions regarding your products, telephone, fax, answers to the listed criteria questions above, and pricing proposal(s) (excel spreads heet) no later than COB 29 APRIL 2005.  Companies must also provide their FSS contract and/or DAPA number for their product(s).  [For information regarding pharmaceutical DAPAs, contact DSCP, at (215) 737-7893.]  Companies not responding by the suspense da te may be eliminated from consideration on any subsequent procurement action for these items.  Again, all submittals must be received by COB 29 APRIL 2005.  To participate, please contact Mr. Kevin Hill the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO), Bldg  3600, Room L34-1A, ATTN: SGLL-TRBO/Mr. Kevin Hill (210-916-7456), 3851 Roger Brooke Drive, San Antonio, TX 78234, e-mail: Kevin.Hill2@amedd.army.mil.

BACKGROUND

 

The Disaster Resources Unit (DRU), within the Field Support Team (FST) at the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), was created to assist with the transition of OFDA to rapid-response activities during a disaster.  In addition, the DRU manages OFDA’s dissemination of public donations information, OFDA’s role in the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination and International Search and Rescue systems, and staff security.

 

INTRODUCTION

 

OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.

 

The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA’s capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

 

The Operations Division (OPS) consists of three teams; the Operations Support Team (OST), the Overseas Administration Team (OAT), and the Field Support Team (FST).

 

The OST provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue (SAR), Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, Consequence Management, overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and other sectors necessary to assure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

 

The OAT provides administrative services to OFDA’s field offices.  The OAT also manages the Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) program, which provides rapid, surge capacity staffing.

 

The FST coordinates surge capacity staffing mechanisms, manages an inter-agency agreement with the US Forest Service for surge capacity staffing and OFDA response system design, maintains and trains on disaster response systems such as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) and the Response Management Team (RMT), coordinates with other agencies in the USG and with some elements of the UN, and coordinates the Public Donations Information and Outreach project.  

 

OBJECTIVE

 

The DRU Field Coordinator will assist the DRU Unit Leader with rapid response facilitation, donations information coordination, and representation of OFDA with the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination and International Search and Rescue systems.

<DESC>THIS IS AN 8(a), HUBZone, AND SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a), HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firm’s participants with bona-fide places of business in the Nashville District Office of the Small Business Administration (SBA).  The Navy is targeting the issuance of approximately fifteen (15) Blanket Ordering Agreements (BOA’s), 5 - 8(a)'s, 5 - HUBZone's, and 5 - SDVOSB's.  The estimated period of performance will be three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two (2) years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).  BOA’s are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB serviced by the United States SBA District Offices.  The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (Navy) and the 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSB firms to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, and if and when ordered.  The BOA Holders will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order.  On a semi-annual basis, the Navy and the SBA Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of (a) a usefulness and need for service, and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to the BOA holders for submission of a proposal.  If the parties are able to come to an agreement, a contractual document, i.e. task order, will be issued and the BOA holder will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision, and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the task order, as directed by the Contracting Officer.  Competition for the BOA task orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA District noted in this synopsis.  However, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition if unable to obtain adequate competition.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under this agreement, but there is a threshold minimum of less than or equal to $2,500.00 that can be placed on a task order with a maximum of $1,000,000.00.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000.00 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each task order.  There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work.  Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the BOA holder or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the BOA Holders only.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks.  Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types.  EMERGENCY REPAIRS: Broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors, and windows, etc., exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems, HVAC, and others.  MINOR COSTRUCTION: Miscellaneous exterior and interior renovations, fence, shelters, ramps, sidewalks, concrete work, installation or replacement of utilities, pipelines, and conduits, installation of miscellaneous electrical and mechanical devices, roof repairs, demolition projects, asphalt, painting, exterior, and interior, ceiling repairs or modifications.  DESIGN: On-site solutions for emergency calls and Design/Build Services for minor construction items.  The SIC/NAICS Codes covered under the BOA for work performed in the NAICS Groups 234, 236 for construction, and 238.  GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military installations within the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC) Memphis area of responsibility.  The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years.  The agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued there under.  If a firm is graduating from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the agreement holder and the agreement will be terminated.  Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued.  Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party.  Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task order prior to the effective date of the cancellation.  The agreement holders maybe required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal.  SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror.  The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead, and profit at any time.  ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time.  Each order will be considered a separate binding contract.  LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The average range will be between $2,500.00 and $100,000.00.  SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: (1) Provide 8(a) certification and applicable district or an 8(a) participant with a bona fide place of business in either location.

Organize and conduct reviews, such as System Requirements Review (SRR), Preliminary Design Review (PDR), Critical Design Review (CDR), and Flight Readiness Review (FRR). Combine lower-level inputs to develop integrated budgets and schedules.  5) Systems Analysis and Simulation Based Acquisition (SBA): Create and use a federation-based distributed modeling and simulation capability to support system architecture studies and the transfer and management of engineering data across all program organizations and throughout the life cycle of the program. Select preferred SoS and System level design solutions by evaluating and refining competing architectures.  6) Requirements Definition and Functional Analysis: Perform analysis and decomposition of ESMD SoS requirements to form, allocate and manage performance requirements at the element level, as well as requirements for margins, technology, interface definition, testing, and verification.  7) Design Synthesis, Manufacturing, and Assembly: Maintain technical insight into the design, development, margin management, manufacturing and assembly processes, and individual EI element-based integrated performance. Ensure use of compatible techniques for analysis, interface control and verification. Ensure a common SoS perspective among all lower-level project processes. Maintain technical insight into the SoS end-to-end subsystems (such as Structures, Thermal Control, Environmental Control and Life Support, EVA Support, Propulsion, Guidance Navigation and Control (GN&C), Electrical Power, Avionics) to evaluate their impact of the end-end SoS.  8) Test and Verification: Plan and execute Testing and Verification (T&V) of multi-element integrated systems, including simulations. Resolve test anomalies.  9) Operations and Sustaining Engineering: Develop operations requirements and evaluate how operation concepts impact the EI SoS. Perform mission planning, operations training, mission analysis, anomaly resolution and supportability. Sustain program with anomaly analysis and resolution, and recommendations for element block upgrades to accommodate future spirals.  Responses must include the following: name and address of firm, capabilities related to the task areas above, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners; intent to participate in the upcoming acquisition as a prime offeror; list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).

ACTION:  Notice of public meeting.

SUMMARY:  General Services Administrator Stephen A. Perry testified on March 16, 2005, before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform on the agency's efforts to improve performance by reorganizing and consolidating the General Services Administration’s (GSA) Federal Technology Service (FTS) and GSA’s Federal Supply Service (FSS).  In his testimony, Administrator Perry stated that "We believe that it is important for organizations that desire to achieve high performance and continuous improvement to periodically review their operations and organizational structures in order to make improvements where possible."   He also emphasized that this initiative is designed to:
•	Strengthen GSA's capability to meet increasing customer requirements for excellence in the acquisition of information and other products and services;
•	Make it easier for industry contractors to understand and use our acquisition process; and
•	Enhance the efficiency of GSA's administrative support functions by consolidating certain activities that are now performed in separate units.

A copy of Administrator Perry's prepared testimony can be found at www.gsa.gov, under GSA Reference, Congressional Testimony, or http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?pageTypeId=8199&channelId=-13338&P=S&contentId=18335&contentType=GSA_BASIC.

Additional outreach is underway to solicit viewpoints from GSA associates and customers.  


DATE:  The meeting will be held on Thursday, April 21, 2005, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., local time.

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Description 


The Container IPT, Agile Combat Support Systems Squadron (ACSSS), Air Armament Center, Eglin AFB FL, is requesting information from potential sources capable of updating and improving or redesigning the Government’s Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS).  CDRS is a database of long life, reusable containers established to prevent the proliferation and duplication of munitions containers within DOD.  CDRS provides tri-service users (which include the Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, Marines, Defense Logistics Agency and contractors) with a means of submitting a request via phone, fax, email ( cdrs@eglin.af.mil ) or through the CDRS websites, https://peonet.eglin.af.mil/containers/site.htm  or https://wmnet.eglin.af.mil/containers/site.htm to the Container IPT to search its database for possible existing or proven containers or container designs.  The current CDRS was written in 1991 in Microsoft ACCESS and contains approximately 6000 containers.  The data provided by the tri-service users to the Container IPT and captured in the database include: Requestor Information: Project Lead (Full Name), Street Address, City/Base, State/Province, Zip/Postal Code, Telephone (area code and DSN), Fax (area code and DSN), E-mail, DOD/Government Activity (Office Symbol), Contractor, Contract Number, Government POC, POC Information: POC Address, POC City/Base, POC State/Province, POC Zip/Postal Code, POC Telephone (are code and DSN), POC Fax (area code and DSN), POC E-mail, Item Description: Nomenclature, NSN/Part Number, Dimensions: Length, Width, Height, Diameter, Weight (lbs), Fragility of Item (linked to Fragility Factors), Item DOD Hazard Class, Drawing Available (Yes/No radial buttons), Special Handling Requirements or Constraints, Container Requirements: Quantity, Date Required, Number Items Per Container, Container Composition, Shock Migration System, Opening Style, Other Required Features.  Features/improvements to CDRS desired include: auto back-up, incorporation of standard fail-safe software devices to prevent inadvertent loss and corruption of information, enforcement of referential integrity, automatic entry date tag to identify date CDRS request submitted, feature to prevent unused spaces and blank records from being saved to the database, check all objects for dead ends and errors, indicator on each form to show user the number of records returned from a filter, improved ease of adding new records (autonumber or macro for creating sequential and unique key field values, check default values, and improve error handling for invalid new records), simple switchboard tied to an autoexec macro, improve look of reports (headers, footers, fonts, etc), consider a form for all reports with command buttons and report descriptions, addition of “Email This Record” functions, investigate how to automatically import missing FEDLOG records, and create the following automated reports:  compact and expanded view of assets and requests, Email ready responses to container requests, Cost savings statistics, Database activity metrics, Customer feedback reports.  ACSSS has no software platform preference.  Upgrades and improvements or redesign must be cost effective (currently the ACSSS projected budget for this project is $40K), user friendly and compatible with Windows XP Operating System.  Responses to this request for information (RFI) will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  In order to initiate an exchange of information, we are requesting that interested parties submit any or both of the following: (1) an up to 5 page paper that identifies proven software or database upgrade and improvement solutions and explains potential for adaptation to CDRS, and (2) product brochures or marketing materials.  Firms responding to this RFI should state whether they are or are not a small business concern or small, disadvantaged business concern as defined by FAR 52.219-1 and 52.219-2, respectively.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  Respondents to this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their submittals.  This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a Request For Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to conduct any follow-on acquisition.

FAR 52.217-5 - “EVALUATION OF OPTIONS” 
	
Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 
(End of provision) 

52.217-9 - “OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT” 

(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days of the end of the period of performance; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. 
(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. 
(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five (5) years. 
(End of clause) 

FAR 52.212-2 – EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999). 

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 
Order of Importance:  The Government will evaluate proposals based on the following factors: Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  Technical (Factor 1), Past Performance (Factor 2), and Price (Factor 3) are of equal importance.
	
Evaluation Procedures:  The Government intends to award one contract to the responsive, responsible offer using the lowest priced, technically acceptable source selection process.  Technical Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability or unacceptability only.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.   Once a proposal has been determined acceptable under Factor 1 and Factor 2, the proposal will then be evaluated for the lowest price.

Factor 1 – Technical Capability:  Technical capability will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.  An offeror must comply with all aspects of the technical requirements as established in the Statement of Work and must meet criteria set forth in the Evaluation Criteria.  Also included are general considerations such as contract terms and conditions.

Factor 2 – Past Performance:  Past Performance acceptability will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a “Neutral/Unknown Confidence” rating for past performance. In investigating relevant past performance, the Government will consider information in the offerors proposal and information obtained from other sources.  Other sources may include past and present customers and their employees, other Government agencies including state and local agencies, pre-award surveys, consumer protection agencies and better business bureaus, and others who may have useful information.  Factors such as customer satisfaction, timeliness, product quality, and similarity to the existing project will be taken into account.  To be acceptable, the proposal must provide sufficient information about the offerors performance record that the Government can determine that the offeror should be able to successfully perform the required effort.

Factor 3 - Price:  Technically acceptable proposals found to have an acceptable record of technical capabilities and past performance will be evaluated for the lowest price.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.

 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision)
Discussions: Discussions or negotiations may be conducted with all offerors within the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.610.  If an offeror is given an opportunity to correct any deficiencies in a proposal and after correction the proposal is still determined to be unacceptable, such determinations will be cause for rejection of the proposal.  No offeror will be given an unlimited amount of opportunities for correction of a proposal. The Government reserves the right to make a final determination whether a proposal is acceptable or unacceptable solely on the basis of the information submitted and to proceed without requesting additional information.

Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions Installation and Registration Checklist

Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts

1.  Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) (www.ccr.gov) to see if your company is registered.
·	If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below.
·	For help with registration in CCR, contact the CCR Help desk, 888-227-2423 or e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.

2.  Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR).
·	All vendors desiring to quote on goods or services in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/.  
·	Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/Fax number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc).
·	Note:  All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually.  Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.

3.  Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC).
·	The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company.  You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm.
·	To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/ and click on “Search CCR.”  Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click “Submit Query.”  If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS.
·	Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page.  There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC.  If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet.  If you see that there is no one listed as your company’s EB POC, you need to click on “Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN” to add it.
·	Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC’s (primary and alternate) for each CAGE/DUNS combination.
·	The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor’s organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor.
·	Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.  Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete.  For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html





4.  Establish a group in WAWF-RA associated with your cage code(s).  This can be 
     done by calling DISA-Ogden Customer Support at 1-800-392-1798 or by
     e-mailing cscassig@ogden.disa.mil

5.  Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM).  (Proceed to paragraph 6 if you are not going to designate a GAM).
·	In medium to large sized companies, there may be need to establish more than one GAM.
·	A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account.
·	The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC.  To appoint additional GAM’s, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC.
·	The appointment letter should be faxaed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
·	The Group Administrator’s Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users.
·	The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.

6.  Establish an organizational e-mail address
·	All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes, the system generates an e-mail notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm’s organizational e-mail account.
·	The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational e-mail to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
·	Ensure that your firm’s organizational e-mail address is operational and can receive e-mail from WAWF-RA prior to registering your e-mail address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center.
·	Note:  If you do not set up an organizational e-mail address, the personal e-mail address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational e-mail address for your firm.

7.  Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA
·	Set up the PCs of your organization’s users to access WAWF-RA.
·	Select the “Setting Up Your Machine” link on the WAWF-RA home page.  For more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.

8.  Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA website
·	Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA website by completing the on-line registration form.
·	Select the “Self Register” link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions.
·	Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate.  Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering.
·	PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operation Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com.  The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate.
·	If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center. 
·	Note:  Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an e-mail from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR database.


9.  Follow-Up (If necessary).
·	If your (GAM or user) account hasn’t been activated within two business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:

<DESC>The following Question and Answer amendment is issued to answer nine (9) technical questions received in response to Synopsis/Solicitation W9124R-5068-0003.  Due date for proposals remains 4:30 pm MST 11 April 2005. Q1.  Do we include freight costs in our quote? A1.  Yes, your quote total must include all costs, including freight/shipping.  Q2. Is this VRC going to be located outside and exposed to the elements? A2. Yes. Q3. Is this a thru-floor application, or adjacent to a mezzanine or 2nd floor level application?  A3.  No Q4. You request interlocked double swing doors.  Can we assume this is only required at the lower 1st floor loading dock level.  A4. No.  Doors for both floors Q5. You indicate a roll up door on the upper 2nd floor level.  Is this roll up door existing or to be provided?  If it is to be provided, then by whom?  If existing, then is it still necessary for  us to provide an interlocked double swing door at this upp er level?  A5. This is an existing roll-up door.  Interlocking is required. Q6. The VRC is going to be installed on a concrete slab-on-grade surface.   We offer an add on for including an approach ramp for flush floor loading/unloading.  Do you request this approach ramp be included in our base bid? A6. Ramp is not required. Q7.  You requested a fully enclosed hoistway between floor levels.  We can provide 8-foot high expanded metal enclosures on 2-sides of the lift with interlocked double swing doors at the 1st floor level with a mezzanine back stop panel at the upper 2nd flo or level or we can provide enclosures full height up to the 2nd floor level.  If full height enclosures are required, is there a minimum 2nd floor clear overhead dimension or is the lift outside or in an atrium where no 2nd floor minimum clear overhead exi sts?  A7. Full height is required.  The lift will be located outside. Q8. You request a modular design.   Our lift is generally shipped in a knock down form where assembly is required.  We anticipate 1-week installation with a 2-man crew in addition to onsite Supervision by  our  technician.  We will include Quick Connect el ectrical wiring for ease of installation.  We assume this is acceptable.  A8. By modular we mean that the VRC is bolt together design. (No welding required)  The unit shall not require any alterations in the field.  The only acceptable 'field fitting' will be for anchoring the lift to the existing structure.  Q9.  You request pre-wired in conduit at factory.  We assume some minimal wiring and conduit to be part of your installation requirements.  Is this acceptable?  A9.  Minimal wiring is acceptable to connect the unit to the power supply and for interconnections.  All connections shall be marked on the assembly drawings and  NEMA 4 enclosures shall be provided.
