<SUBJECT>B--Analysis of Potential Biological and Physical Impacts of Dredging on Offshore Ridge and Shoal Features
<SOLNBR>0103RP72020
<RESPDATE>032803
<ARCHDATE>03092004
<CONTACT>Dick Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>This announcement (0103RP72020) solicits sources to perform an analysis of potential biological and physical impacts of dredging on offshore ridge and shoal features, and to define engineering alternatives and options to avoid adverse environmental impacts.  BACKGROUND.  The United States (U.S.) Government, and specifically, the Minerals Management Service (MMS), a bureau within the U. S. Department of the Interior, has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf. Public Law 103-426, enacted October 31, 1994, gives the MMS the authority to convey, on a noncompetitive basis, the rights to Federal OCS sand, gravel, or shell resources for shore protection, beach or wetlands restoration projects, or for use in construction projects funded in whole or part or authorized by the Federal Government.  Many of the submerged shoals located in ridge and swale areas located in Federal waters offshore the East and Gulf of Mexico coasts are being targeted as potential long-term sources of sand for beach and coastal restoration projects. However, these features are often areas of intense biological activity (fishery resources, etc.), as well as playing a role in mitigating the local wave climate, especially during intense storm events. A recently completed biological/physical monitoring protocols study (available for download at http://www.mms.gov/itd/pubs/2001/2001-089.pdf) raised the following questions relative to the continued use of submerged shoals as sand borrow areas: Are there procedures to dredge shoal and ridge features that will minimize ecological impacts and/or speed recovery, such as dredging completely one specific shoal or ridge and leaving adjacent features untouched vs. dredging a small amount of sand from each shoal or ridge feature, or dredging in strips leaving undisturbed areas that act as local sources of recruitment and allow recruitment from older life stages? Is there a preferred manner to remove sand from a shoal/ridge feature to maximize their use and maintain the integrity of the feature? (For example, there are currently concerns that certain dredging practices result in the accumulation of fine-grained sediments in the borrow areas, making the site unsuitable for re-use.)  Are there areas within sand ridges where it is best to dredge to speed recovery and reduce long-term impacts? SCOPE OF WORK: As the Federal agency responsible for regulation of OCS sand resources, the MMS must ensure that dredging operations conducted under its jurisdiction are conducted in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  Information that can be used to suggest engineering options and mitigation measures that can be implemented to avoid potential deleterious impacts, while allowing for the selective removal of the needed volumes of sand for nearby beach projects, is largely absent. Therefore, the objectives of the study are to examine the biological and physical effects of offshore dredging within the ridge and swale features on the Federal OCS and to suggest engineering options and mitigation measures that can be implemented to avoid potential deleterious impacts. The period of performance of the resultant contract will be thirty-six (36) months with an estimated cost of $400,000. A technical manuscript, a scientific paper for publication in a refereed journal, and presentation of the study results at a scientific or technical conference, are required. TO VIEW THE DETAILED STATEMENT OF WORK and the required deliverables and schedule, go to www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp and look up Solicitation Number 01-03-RP-72020.

<SOLNBR>0403RP71358A
<RESPDATE>042503
<ARCHDATE>03092004
<CONTACT>Dick Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>This requirement was previously announced under Presolicitation Notice 0403RP71358.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2002-12.  Solicitation Number 1435-04-03-RP-71358 applies; the solicitation is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).  GovWorks will provide contract support to the JAMI Program Office for this acquisition, and all questions must be sent to the Contracting Office via email.  No information will be provided to any vendor who contacts the Program Office or other related technical office.  All pertinent information will be disseminated through the Contracting Office.  BACKGROUND: The JAMI Program Office is a joint services Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program Office established to develop a package of integrated instrumentation components for applications in tri-service (Air Force, Army, Navy) small missile test and training applications.  The program will provide GPS/IMU based TSPI, missile/weapon attitude and vector scoring for range safety and test and evaluation applications, and will also provide a method to track missiles and targets by utilizing existing telemetry links and infrastructure, without relying on ground based radar.  The JAMI components include both airborne and ground based systems.  The high dynamic TSPI unit is the airborne component of the system.  The purpose of this procurement is to acquire the high dynamic TSPI unit, which consists of 5 primary components: (1) A GPS sensor. (2) Inertial Measurement Sensors/Unit. (3)  Data Acquisition System. (4) Digital Interface Formatter (processor).  (5) Associated Power System.  REQUIREMENT: The contractor shall design, develop, fabricate, test, and deliver the JTU in accordance with this solicitation and its associated Statement of Work (SOW) and the Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs).  These documents, along with the technical specifications for the JTU High Dynamic JTU II, the GSU, and the TUMS, can be found on the GovWorks web site at www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp.  Look up this RFP Number: 1435-04-03-RP-71358.  The JTU development shall be undertaken in two phases.  The initial effort will include the mechanical and electrical design, the selection of the IMU sensor and the software/firmware design of the internal processes as indicated by the JTU specification and the TSPI specification.  The GSUs for this phase of the development and associated ground processors (2 each) will be provided as GFE and will be form-fit-modified function sensors that perform like the final configuration unit currently under development for the JAMI program by ParthusCeva, which is scheduled for final delivery in August 2003.  The prime hardware deliverable under Phase 1 shall be five complete form-fit-modified function JTU units.  Limited pre-qualification testing will be required that includes, at a minimum, operational testing at temperature and vibration.  Period of Performance for Phase I is 9 months after receipt of order.  The Government anticipates that Phase I for CLIN 1 and CLIN 2 shall be a firm fixed price award with associated travel to be paid at cost in accordance with the current GTR.  The second phase of this development effort will be to integrate the final GSU configuration into the design and perform qualification testing on the final JTU configuration.  The Government will not initiate this phase until such time that the final GSU configuration is qualified.  Performance information on the ParthusCeva products will be made available by the Government upon request.  Use of these components is recommended; however, the contractor may propose other GPS technology that meets the requirements of NAWC-3125, if desired.  Note that the ParthusCeva GSU also requires a ground processor.  Under contract with Integrity Systems Inc., the Government has also developed accumulation algorithms to process the IMU data and accumulate the data to a high degree of accuracy.  The Government proposes to make these algorithms available under license to the JTU designer if requested.  These algorithms and associated implementation code are ITAR controlled; therefore, the JTU contractor must be able to obtain ITAR approval prior to contract award.  The Government will acquire from ParthusCeva any GSUs required for completion of CLIN 3 and CLIN 4 of Phase 2 of this contract.  These items shall then be provided to the JTU Contractor as GFE.  As prescribed in FAR 45.106(b)(1), the clause at 52.245-2 Government Property (Fixed Price Contracts) applies.  Pre-delivery testing shall be conducted by the Contractor; however, GSU high dynamic testing may be supported by Government simulation testing facilities if requested.  The firm deliverables under Phase II are: a minimum of 3 qualification units for qualification testing, and 15 limited production units (CLIN 3 and CLIN 4).  Period of Performance for this part of Phase II is 10 months after receipt of the Phase II award, and shall also be awarded as firm fixed price.  Additional follow-on options could include: Up to 400 hours of T&M Contractor support to a missile prime contractor or Government personnel at a national range during integration of the JTU into a missile system or related JTU testing at a range, up to 40 months after receipt of order; and two optional FFP production runs of up to 100 units each, which would have a POP any time within Phase II (CLINs 5,6 and 7). GSUs for the optional portion of Phase 2 will be the responsibility of the Contractor and will not be provided as GFE. If all options are exercised, the Government estimates that the total award will be in the range of $3 million to $5 million.  HOW TO COMPETE.  Gov.Works will conduct this acquisition by first reviewing and evaluating the experience and capability of your organization and proposed project team as demonstrated by the information supplied in a Qualifications Statement.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Economic Development and Support Office (REDSO) in Nairobi, Kenya is seeking qualified firms and/or consortiums to provide for a five year multi-contractor Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) to implement Conflict Prevention, Mitigation and Response (CPMR) programming in sub Saharan Africa.  This IQC will support three USAID Africa Regional Offices: the Regional Economic Development Support Office (REDSO) for East and Southern Africa in Nairobi, the West Africa Regional Program (WARP) in Bamako and the Regional Center for Southern Africa (RCSA) in Gaborone and potentially other interested US Government entities.
 
This IQC purpose includes, but is not limited to the following:
 
       The IQC will enable REDSO, WARP and RCSA, and other USG entities, to deliver both financial and in-kind resources for CPMR programming in their respective regions to inter-governmental, governmental and non-governmental grantees rapidly and flexibly in response to evolving conflict situations and within their respective Results Frameworks.  The IQC will also enable the regional offices to serve USAID bilateral mission needs as they arise.  The range of possible activities includes: conflict assessment; CPMR training; institutional strengthening; small and large grants; study, testing, dissemination and implementation of effective approaches; information and communications technology (ICT) informational and meetings and conferences for NGO, government, donor and USG partners; and monitoring and evaluation.  
 
       Each office, either separately or in partnership, will detail its needs (focus of activities, geographic limits, contract period, available funds etc) in a task order and select one or more of the identified IQC contractors to implement the full range of its CPMR programming.  This will simplify and streamline both procurement and management processes and systems and will eliminate redundant multi-contractor administrative infrastructure.  Additional task orders will be written if and when the need for significant additional CPMR activities
 
       Use of a joint contracting mechanism will help the three regional offices and other USG entities to fulfill their commitment to increase exchanges and promote greater synergies by offering many opportunities for consultations during planning, implementation and evaluation phases.
 
The complete Request for Proposals will be published on or about March 31, 2003.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for engineering services required to perform the Flight Robotics Laboratory (FRL) Characterization Task.  This effort supports the build of the Demonstration of Rendezvous Technology (DART) simulation lab, which simulates proximity operations of orbital space vehicle systems.  It includes analysis, software development, operational support for performance tests, and documentation tasks.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services from Dynamic Concepts, Inc.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.   This task is to complete an existing effort that provides for engineering services to support the FRL. This work was originally a subcontracted effort under Quality Research, Inc. (QRI) contract NAS8-00113.  In February 2003, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) purchased QRI, and as such, the contract with QRI will end on March 31, 2003.	This 8-month task will complete updates to existing test procedures, software development involving the kinematic equations of the robot joints, updates to a desktop kinematic model and engineering analysis and support in development of a hardware in the loop (HWIL) simulation for the Demonstration of Rendezvous Technology (DART) project.  DCI personnel originally produced the procedures, software, and desktop model.	The support of the DART simulation is in progress. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. local time on March 18, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) requires the charter of four commercial trawlers to conduct a bottom trawl survey of groundfish resources of the continental shelf and slope zone (30 to 700 fathoms) from the Canadian border around Cape Flattery, Washington to the Mexican border near San Diego, California. Each vessel will be under charter for approximately 60 days with a required option to extend the charter for 15 additional days. The charters will begin in Newport, Oregon, unless another port is selected by mutual agreement, and end in San Diego, California. Each charter period will be broken into five to six cruise legs of seven to ten days each with a two-to-three day port call between legs. Under the direction of a NMFS-designated chief scientist, the vessels will fish in a systematic manner with bottom trawl gear according to a pre-specified survey design and a manual governing the construction, rigging, and operation of the trawl gear used for sampling. The trawl gear to be used during the charter will be supplied by NWFSC, as will a portable trawl instrumentation system that will be used to monitor and measure various aspects of the trawl's performance during sampling hauls. The vessels must allow for thru-hull transducers to be installed in dry dock. The Government intends to award up to four charters to serve either during the first survey period beginning on or about June 1, 2003 or during the second survey period, which will begin two weeks after the end of the first and will also run for approximately eight weeks. Offerors may propose more than one vessel. The charter contract will include an option, to be exercised at the Government's sole discretion, to charter the vessel(s) again for the same period and purpose in 2004. In general, typical coastal trawlers are required, however, vessels must be at least 60 feet long and have a minimum horsepower rating of 400. The vessel must be capable of towing the experimental gear at a minimum speed of 2.2 knots at a fishing depth of 700 fathoms and must be able to maintain a cruising speed of at least 8 kn in low sea states.

This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems
necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

2. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

3. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically
destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.
The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Pathology (LP), Specialized Diagnostics Unit plans to procure immunohistochemical and in situ-hybridization staining reagents and supplies from Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., 3865 North Business Center Drive, Tucson, AZ 85705. The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.5 as an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. The Laboratory of Pathology (LP) has a need to provide immunohistochemical staining requested by both the diagnostic services and research laboratories within the LP.  These stains have become an essential part of cancer diagnosis and have an equally important role in the diagnosis of many infectious diseases.  Immunohistochemistry is a widespread and accepted technique used in nearly every diagnostic surgical pathology laboratory and research laboratories throughout the world.  The reagents shall be used for diagnostic immunohistochemistry laboratory clinical use as well as for supporting clinical and basic research in the LP.  The automated portable immunostainers shall be used to support the increased clinical and research demands being placed upon the immunohistochemistry laboratory.  The NCI  has purchased several automated immunostaining/in situ-hybridization systems (i.e. Ventana ES, NexES, Benchmark and Discovery systems) from Ventana Medical Systems under  previous contracts.  Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. is the only source known to NCI that can provide the reagents and supplies that are required to operate the Ventana automated immunostainers/in situ-hybridization Ventana ES, NexES, Benchmark and Discovery systems.  The reagents are proprietary to Ventana Medical. The Government will be the direct beneficiary of a contract for reagents and supplies because it will maintain and improve the quality of patient care and further cancer research.  Without the reagents, the existing automated systems cannot be used.  Changing variables at this time would interrupt correct interpretation of experiments in progress.  Period of Performance: Upon award of purchase order through twelve (12) months, with three (3) twelve (12) month option renewals if exercised;  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) and FAR Clause 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000) applies to this order.  The requirement will be a fixed price order.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above supplies, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington D.C. time) on February 14, 2003.   If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

Tennessee State University will provide all the necessary Logistical Support for the workshop.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) continue to play a significant role in the education of minorities, make outstanding intellectual and scientific contributions that are indispensable to the broader society, and serve as centers for ethic and minority culture.  These institutions, however, have experienced difficulties in winning grants and contracts as a result of competitively issued Request for Proposals (RFP) for Research and Development Requirements (R&D) from the Federal and State Government and in many cases in the private sector as well.  During the 1990 HBCU/MIs comprise approximately 12.7 percent of all U.S. Institutions conducting research and development, yet they receive less than 1.5 percent of the research dollars awarded to institutions of higher education.  Tennessee State University is the only known source to NCI that can provide the necessary services required by the Agency.  TSU will provide all services on their Campus in Nashville, TN.  The servcies will be performed by TSU's staff and students.  This is not a solcitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above services, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be in writing and received in the contracting office by 2:00 PM EST, on March 14, 2003.  For further information please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct  competitive procurement.  No collects calls will be accepted.  NAICS Code 611710.

<DESC>Technical POC/Program Manager, Mr. James R. Milligan, AFRL/IFTB, telephone: (315) 330-3013, email:  James.Milligan@rl.af.mil.   Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Arnold J. Kloven, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-4767, email: Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil.  The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to support the development of a Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) fuselet production environment. Specifically, this effort will develop a fuselet production environment as specified in the Fuselet Definition Document provided at the following URL: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/tech/programs/jbi/documents/fuselet_definition.doc.  However, this solicitation seeks only to implement the necessary subset of those fuselet capabilities described in the Fuselet Definition Document to meet the following objectives.  The fuselet production environment will:  (1)  Interoperate with an AFRL supplied implementation of the JBI (Java-based).  (2)  Be JBI Common Application Programmer Interface (CAPI) compliant, and produce fuselets that are CAPI compliant.  Java bindings to the CAPI can be found at http://www.infospherics.org/. (3) Provide a fuselet authoring capability that allows the production of fuselets from a library of components.  (4) Support the creation of these logic components (primitives) themselves.  (5) Produce a portable definition (e.g., XML) of a fuselet that is machine independent and machine readable for the purposes of compilation.  Fuselets will be self-describing.  (6)  Provide a compilation capability to generate stand-alone clients (fuselets) based on their self-description.  By "stand-alone", we mean that the fuselets generated will not be required to run directly on the JBI Platform, as described in the Fuselet Definition Document.  Only rudimentary capabilities for a fuselet server and runtime management environment that do not require JBI Platform resources are anticipated to be developed as a part of this effort.
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a three (3) to five (5) page white paper. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: James R. Milligan, Rome Research Site/IFTB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505 and reference BAA-03-08-IFKA. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 04. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award. White papers for FY03 should be submitted by 10 Apr 03. White papers for FY04 should be submitted by 1 Mar 04. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective Fiscal Year after the dates cited.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.
The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Best Value -Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Also, consideration will be given to other factors such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. 
Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal which shall be considered.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.  Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start approximately the third quarter of FY03. Initial awards of 12 months duration are anticipated to range from $500K to $1.5M, and the total cumulative dollar value of all awards will not exceed $3M under this BAA.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:  $1.5M in FY03 and $1.5M in FY04.
An informational briefing/industry day is not planned.
Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Arnold J. Kloven, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-4767 or e-mail Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding.  The e-mail must reference the title and BAA 03-08-IFKA.

The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.  A copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Clarifications to M-OP-HRAM-AFM-01-002

Question 1. Would you by any chance know the expected number of Designated Contractors (DCs) that will access the web-portal or for whom payment/record services will be provided either monthly, quarterly or yearly? 

Answer:  It is not known at this time.

Question 2. Would you be recommending that the DCs use the accounting features that 
Contractors programs could provide through the web -portal?

Answer:  Yes.

Question 3.  If DCs should adopt #2 above who will be responsible to pay the related  
fees? DCs or USAID?

Answer:  The DCs would be responsible to do so.

Question 4. When will work begin in 2003?

Answer:  The timeframe will depend on the completion of the evaluation process but it will be implemented expeditiously.

Question 5. Is this work currently being performed by a contractor?  If so Who is 
providing it?

Answer:  No, there is no incumbent nor anyone providing this service.

Question 6. How many transactions are expected to be performed in a typical week or 
month? 

Answer:  It is unknown at this time.  It will depend on the need of USAID and the availability of the DCs.

Question 7. Is the government estimate of $5M for one year or for the whole duration of 
the contract period 2003 to 2007?

Answer:  The whole contract period through 2007.

Question 8.  Will a more detailed RFP be issued through FedBizOpps?  If so, can you tell me what the projected release date will be?

Answer:  No.  The synopsis and solicitation were combined within this notice.

Question 9.    General services requested:  It is unclear as to whether USAID is seeking ?
a. a technology provider/integrator to aggregate and facilitate transactions between existing systems and provide appropriate portal interfaces to make accessing such information easier for the USAID CTO and DCs.  Is this a portal to access many different systems?
b. a technology and service provider to provide a complete turnkey system that performs such requirements natively, including building a datawarehouse/central repository of DC information with appropriate interfaces for USAID personnel and/or DCs; or
c. an employment services firm to perform either of the above in addition to the provision and administration of employee benefits packages

Answer:  The need will be determined through the proposed methods provided by the Contractor for DC use. 

Question 10.  SOW states The Contractor must provide USAID with invoices, payment, and online administration services for USAIDs current and anticipated future assignments.  As this is a Firm Fixed Price contract, please specify what the anticipated future assignments are.

Answer:  The DC assignments as they are needed and any technological changes as systems are updated and developed throughout the upcoming years.

Question 11.  SOW states:  enable DCs to register, enroll, or otherwise effect their transition through a secure web-based systems architecture (including access to W-4 forms, insurance forms, and others as designated by USAID);   Is the Contractor system intended to interface with pre-existing systems such as the insurance forms?  If so, please define the system and relevant interface capabilities.  

Answer: No.  The Contractor will need to propose a way to provide this need within their proposal.

Question 12.  SOW states:  provide DCs with the option to participate in Contractor-sponsored benefits programs; pre-tax health, dental, vision, and life insurance plans (to be designed by the Contractor as part of this engagement);  What is the actual intent of USAID and their DCs for this?  The employee/employer relationship required for these types of benefits does not seem feasible through to a Contractors benefit program.  Please confirm that the Contractor is responsible for providing a benefits package to the DCs.  Please define the baseline benefits package requirements/contents.  Please define how the reimbursement of the benefits package component will occur if this is a Firm Fixed Price contract?  Please define the quantity and geographical distribution of the DCs relative to these requirements.  Please define how the scope of provision of the benefits package will be weighed in the contract evaluation.

Answer:  The Contractor again is responsible to propose a way to provide the requirements needed.  The entire proposal will be evaluated based on the stated criterias within the solicitation.

Question 13.  SOW states:  provide timely and accurate DC payment that is based on DCs time sheet and expense records approved by the CTO. USAID funding release shall be no later than 7 days from receipt of invoice submission;  Please define the methods available for funds disbursement.  Please confirm whether the GSA-SmartPay government-wide Purchase Card is an authorized method of payment.

Answer:  The Contractor will provide a method of doing so within their proposal.  

Question 14.  SOW states:  enable DCs to review the status of their accounts through the online system, or develop contingency processes that can replace any or all online activities in the event of a DCs inability to access the Internet.   Is the requirement for the Contractor based on the DCs temporary inability to access the internet (i.e.: provide an IVR system as a backup) or based on a requirement that some DCs do not have internet access at all and parallel, manual systems must be deployed to support these DCs.  If the latter case, then please define the scope and quantity of DCs that are in this category and define whether all services must be available or just certain core services.

Answer:  This need is stated within the requirement for all DC usage.  It is not known who has and does not have Internet access.

Question 15.  SOW states:  provide a monthly status report monitoring the quality assurance, configuration management, and security management through in-progress Develop contingency processes that can replace any or all online activities in the event of a DCs inability to access the Internet .  What does this mean?  It looks like two paragraphs combined.  Please clarify.

Answer:  A status reporting method will be needed.  If for any reason the Internet is not available, an alternative means would be used and necessary.

Question 16.  SOW states:  Provide appropriate DC orientation and training materials, including (but not limited to): time entry instructions, expense entry instructions, benefits overviews, and instructions on receiving additional support.  Please define training requirements ? online self/help, in person training - centrally or decentrally, telephonic requirements, published materials requirements, support hours, number of DCs, language or localization issues.

Answer:  The Contractor is responsible to provide a method within their proposal and demonstrated through past performance references.

Question 17.  USAID Responsibilities section is unclear.  Are these data feeds to Contractor with DC information?  If so, with what frequency, format, etc.

Answer:  Yes.  The methods and use will be formulated on the basis of the proposals.
 
Question 18.  What is the start up period for the customization required for the unique administrative and financial record types to be integrated with unique USAID systems? What integration must occur and with what USAID systems?  What USAID resources (personnel, third parties, etc) are supporting or involved in the project?

Answer:  The start-up period and other integration will be provided contingent with the proposals submitted to USAID.
 
Question 19.  Please provide a volumetric/scope profile in terms of:  
How many DCs will participate in this process? Are some of the DCs overseas? If so how many and where?
What are the number of transactions that will go through this process? 
What is the dollar volume of payments expected to the DCs?

Answer:  It is not known at this time the volume of DCs.  Your proposal should address a percentage for use of the required service.

Question 20.  Are there any restrictions for the RFQ submission? 

Answer:  No.  The RFQ submission should address the stated needs of the requirement. 


Question 21.  Will there be an extension to this requirement and if not, why? 

Answer:  No.  This requirement asks that you provide a percentage based quote for services and past performance references.  Based on the limited request and the immediate need of the USAID office, the time period will not be extended.

The intent of these specifications is to purchase Dispatch Console Furniture for use by the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Inyo National Forest, Dispatch Center, Bishop, California.  An Adobe Acrobat Drawing is available as a separate .PDF document. 
OVERVIEW  
The Dispatch Section is staffed 12 hours per day, 7 days a week with a minimum staff of two (2) personnel on duty during each shift, with the capability of up to six (6) personnel on duty at one time.  Vendor to provide console furniture that has two independently adjustable countertops to house:  
1)  CAD, Radio and telephone monitors and related hardware; and 
2)  Computer keyboards and dispatcher work surface.  
Consoles must allow dispatchers to work in a sitting or standing position and must have ample adjustments to meet or exceed anticipated federal ergonomic requirements.  The electronic hardware within the furniture must be secured.  Electrical wiring must be concealed to prevent accidental contact or disconnection.
ERGONOMICS
While ergonomic standards have not yet been formally established, the following specifications are considered to conform to proposed requirements:  The console furniture in this specification must provide independent vertical adjustment of both the countertop containing the monitors and the countertop containing keyboards and wiring surface.  Vertical adjustment is to the extent that a dispatcher can comfortably operate equipment from any position ranging from fully seated to fully standing.  Monitors are arranged within easy and adjustable reach of dispatchers.  Electronic hardware shall be able to be rebooted without a person having to crawl under the console to access control switches.
WIRING REQUIREMENTS
Electronic components within the consoles must be secured.  The console furniture must provide the ability to securely house internal electronics or CPUs.  CPUs should be housed within cabinets integral to the console furniture.
Electrical and communications wiring should be concealed and secured to the greatest extent possible to prevent accidental contact with wiring or accidental disconnection.  It is not deemed acceptable to have coiled wiring on the floor to accommodate the vertical adjustment of countertops, as it can become entangled with other items or come in accidental contact with employees.
SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS
All new dispatching facilities must meet seismic requirements.  Consoles must be capable of being anchored to the floor.  Electronic components within the consoles, particularly CPUs, must also be secured. Installations where CPUs are free-standing on top of the console countertops pose a potential danger for the employees in the event of a seismic emergency.  Other installations where CPUs are placed unsecured on the floor of the dispatch office provide no seismic integrity and also expose unsightly and unsafe wiring.  In order to meet seismic requirements, CPUs should be housed within cabinets integral to the console furniture.
VENDOR'S INFORMATION
Vendors will provide photographs and detailed CAD or technical drawings of the Dispatch Consoles and the proposed layout when submitting their quote.  Consoles are to be arranged in such a way as to allow for ample movement throughout the location and be ADA compliant.  A copy of the building specs is uploaded separately.
Vendors shall provide a list of three (3) facilities in which their product is installed and in use.
Offeror(s) shall be the manufacturer, authorized dealer, or certified as fully trained to install, operate, repair, maintain, and service the product for which a quote will be provided.  The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining all permits and licenses necessary to perform the work of this contract in the State of California and for all laborers and subcontractors.

<CONTACT>Rochelle  Blaustein J.D., Director, Technology Transfer and Development, Phone 301-451-3636, Fax 301-401-7461, Email rochelleb@intra.niddk.nih.gov - Linda Schilling, Technology Development Specialist, Phone 301-451-3638, Fax 301-402-7461, Email lindas@intra.niddk.nih.gov
<DESC>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) seeks collaborators for Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to implement a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter clinical trial of vitamin E versus an insulin-sensitizing agent versus placebo in patients with well characterized nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including  both children and adults.  A retrospective and prospective database of adult and pediatric cases of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease will also be created by the newly formulated NIDDK-funded NASH Clinical Research Network that will allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of a large group of patients.  Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease also pose opportunities for CRADAs.             SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to provide insulin-sensitizing agents, Vitamin E and placebo to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial of therapy of  NASH.  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a CRADA to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and/or NASH. 

	Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to provide insulin sensitizing agent(s) such as biguanides or thiazolidinediones, Vitamin E and placebo to study important issues regarding possible treatment options and disease progression in NASH.  The potential Collaborator(s) capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies of NASH and should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed, proposed dosing regimes, possible strategies for assessing compliance, proposed methods for assessing levels of the vitamin E and/or insulin sensitizing agent (s), pharmacokinetics, and drug distribution methodology.  In addition, CRADA partners are being sought for ancillary studies.  Examples of potential studies include: 

1)	The identification of host genetic factors associated with the development of NASH and with the risk of fibrosis progression. This will involve the analysis of genomic DNA from individuals with NASH as well as NAFLD for functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in prioritized candidate genes, which have been identified using a combination of literature search and informatic algorithms including biologic mechanisms, pathogenesis, linkage analysis and biochemical studies.

2)	Exploration of serum markers for fibrosis to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical and laboratory variables.  Also, the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in treatment trials.

3)	Evaluation of the role of lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and analysis of the effect of various therapies on the levels of serum and urine peroxides in patients with NAFLD participating in treatment trials.

4)	Develop gene expression arrays that are diagnostic of fatty liver disease and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, steatosis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.

5)	Use of cytokine assays for analyses of serum/plasma cytokine levels as markers of necro-inflammatory or fibrotic activity in NASH and as surrogate markers of histologic improvement in therapeutic trials of NASH.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. It is not a grant, and is not a contract for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration. The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and may contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA.

	Study Goal:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with NASH using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of NASH and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a database on adult and pediatric patients with NASH and NAFLD including clinical information as well as serum and tissue samples.  In addition, the NASH Clinical Research Network will conduct a prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of promising therapies for NASH, including use of an insulin-sensitizing agent (such as a biguanide or thiazolidinedione) and/or an anti-oxidant (such as vitamin E) compared to placebo.    
Applicants for a CRADA to support this clinical trial must include a description of investigators and staff with experience and expertise to collaborate in multicenter clinical studies to assess patients with NAFLD and NASH.  Applicants should provide a detailed description of the pharmacokinetics of the proposed drugs to be used including how and when the drugs should be taken.  The process for biologic sample collection, storage and handling needs must be included.  A description of the laboratory tests that are needed including assays to determine specific drug levels along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.  How the drug or product will be sent to each participating center as well as packaging, storing, and accountability issues must be presented.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria: 
1.	The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized in the investigation of an insulin-sensitizing agent or vitamin E in patients with NASH and clearly describe important issues surrounding the evaluation of disease progression in these patients.
2.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the therapeutic agents in a timely manner for the duration of the study. 
3.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to therapeutic treatment and evaluation of NAFLD or NASH, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development.
4.	The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results and ability to be bound by PHS intellectual property policies (see CRADA:  http://ott.od.nih.gov/newpages/crada.pdf).

DATES:  Only written CRADA capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before March 5, 2003 will be considered.   Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement will be invited at the Applicants own expense to discuss with the Study Steering Committee their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Study's Steering Committee on or about March 18, 2003.

<SUBJECT>S--SOURCES SOUGHT FOR PRIVATIZATION UNDER 10 USC 2688, UTILITY SYSTEMS CONVEYANCE AUTHORITY OF ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION UTILITY SYTEMS AT THE ABERDEEN AND EDGEWOOD AREAS OF THE US ARMY GARRISON, ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, MARYLAND.
<SOLNBR>DABJ05 - 10APRIL2003 - TO BE DETERMINED
<RESPDATE>041403
<ARCHDATE>06132003
<CONTACT>John F. Kimball, Jr., 410-278-2373
<DESC>NA The Government seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to the privatization of the electric distribution utility systems at the Aberdeen Area (EA) and Edgewood Area (EA) of the U.S. Army Garrison Aberdeen Proving G round (APG), in accordance with 10 USC 2688, Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and obligation to serve responsibilities.  These include such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations and upgrades, construction, equ ipment and manpower, of Government-owned systems to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or to another entity. The APG is located about 35 miles northeast of Baltimore on two adjacent tracts extending along and into the Chesapeake Bay.  The AA contains about 72,000 acres and the EA contains about 69,000 acres.  The Installation is predominantly, but not totally, an  area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction (also referred to as a Federal enclave).  Upstream electric utility delivery service to the APG is provided by Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE) in accordance with standard commercial service tariff rates fo r transmission voltage (115 kV) service.  Power is delivered separately to the EA and AA distribution systems, which are not interconnected.  The electric utility system historically contained distinct transmission and distribution components.  The distribution components are within the APG and are exclusively used to serve APG and tenant service locations.  The transmission components are locat ed both within and outside of the Installation and were used to provide service to the APG as well as other, non-Government entities.  The transmission system included 115 kV power lines and a 115/34.5 kV substation that served the EA.  Pursuant to the ter ms of a 1950 contract, the transmission facilities were operated and maintained by BGE and at BGEs expense, and were used to provide service to APG as well as communities served by BGE outside of the Installation.  The 1950 contract was recently amended t o provide for the construction of a new, BGE-owned 115/34.5 kV substation and to obligate BGE to continue to provide service under transmission voltage rates but to meter power deliveries to the substation after transformation losses were incurred. The amended contract includes termination provisions if ownership of the internal EA or AA distribution systems is transferred to an entity other than BGE.  Under these provisions, the distribution systems will be served under BGEs primary voltage (34.5 k V) standard tariff rates.  Service under these rates will increase the Installations electric power delivery costs by more than $1.0 million a year.  The amendment also included substantial termination provisions if ownership of the transmission system is  transferred to an entity other than BGE.  The Installation is in the process of privatizing the transmission system to BGE.  This system therefore is NOT included in the scope of this request for information (RFI). The AA electric distribution system contains about 150 circuit miles of primary feeders, about 80 percent of which are overhead and 20 percent of which are underground.  It also contains two 34.5 kV circuits that step down to about forty 13.2 kV, 4.6 kV an d 2.4 kV feeder circuits.  The system also contains 20 substations, 3,100 street light fixtures, 1,650 service connections, 1,900 pole and pad-mount transformers.   The EA electric distribution system contains a 34.5 kV backbone loop that supplies power to  17 distribution substations that step power down to 13.2 kV, 4.16 kV and 2.4 kV feeder circuits.  The system also constrains about 125 miles of overhead lines, five miles of underground line, 1,200 pole and pad-mount transformers, 2,300 street light fixtu res and 1,650 service connections.  The related specific elements of the  privatized electric distribution utility service requirement include: (1) service to all areas within the AA and EA; and (2) preservation of the beneficial service and rate provisions of the 1950 Contract, as amended. In accordance with Section IV.A.2 of the Department of Defenses 9 October 2002 Revised Guidance for the Utilities Privatization Program, it is anticipated that the source selection process shall consider possible long-term costs and benefits to the Unite d States, if the conveyance (of the electric distribution system) affects separate contract relationships, particularly for commodities.  It is further anticipated that the incremental cost of upstream BGE delivery service to the EA and AA under primary r ather than transmission voltage rates will be added to the proposed privatized service life cycle cost of any offeror other than BGE.  This added cost is expected to exceed a base year value of $1.0 million and appropriate inflation adjustments will be app lied to escalate the base year over the proposed 50-year term of any privatized service contract. This RFI is a component of a systematic process to implement the Department of the Armys utility privatization program.  If responsive statements of interest are received, a follow-on element of the process may be an industry forum to be held at the Aberd een Proving Ground.  The forum would be scheduled within two to four weeks from the receipt of expressions of interest to this notice.  Depending on the level of interest, the forum would consist of sequential meetings with either (1) each respondent, or ( 2) a group or subgroup of respondents, or a (3) combination thereof.  If an industry forum is determined necessary, notification will be provided by way of an amendment to this advertisement.  It is anticipated that any proposal received in response to an RFP will require a certification of an offerors legal right to provide all elements of the required service and capability to initiate the service within a reasonable time (e.g., 30 to 60 days) after contract award.  The statement of interest submitted by the offeror shall address, as a minimum, all of the following general criteria:  (1) capability and experience in the ownership, operation, expansion and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial capacity to purch ase, expand, maintain, and operate a utility system; (3) a statement expressing a willingness and understanding of an obligation to provide continuous utility service; (4) understanding of any applicable state or local utility law or franchise requirements , capability of complying with such requirements, and representation of the legal right to provide the applicable service upon contract award; and (5) understanding of the federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, and familiarity and ex perience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations. The statement of interest MUST also address the capability and legal right to provide each of the specific privatized utility service requirements.  To the extent a capability or legal right would involve the cooperation or involvement of a third party, th e basis for such involvement shall be described and assurances that the cooperation or involvement would be forthcoming shall be provided.  A statement of interest shall not exceed 20 pages in length. Interested parties shall refer questions to Mr. John F. Kimball, Jr., at fil.kimball@us.army.mil or call (410) 278-2373.  Send statements of interest to Department of the Army, Army Contracting Agency, APG Directorate of Contracting, ATTN: SFCA-NR-APC-F, F acilities Branch, 4118 Susquehanna Blvd., Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland 21005-3013 no later than noon (12:00 p.m.) local Maryland time, Monday, April 14, 2003.

Therefore, responses are being accepted from all firms. Business affiliations such as joint ventures, teaming arrangements and other business arrangements capable of meeting the requirements of this contract will be entertained.  A-E services are required to provide support to Navy and Marine Corps activities to implement the Navys Installation Restoration (IR) Program requirements. The IR program is designed to address uncontrolled hazardous substance, pollutant and contaminant sites at Department of Navy (DON) activities, with the ultimate goal of site remediation and regulatory closure.  In accordance with the requirements of Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986, DoD activities are required to follow and comply with all U. S. Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA) and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) guidelines, rules, regulations, and criteria including the National Oil and Hazardous Substance Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  In addition to the A-E services identified under CERCLA, the contractor may also be assigned Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and Underground Storage Tank (USTR) support projects.  The contractor may also be assigned to support other types of work of similar nature related to air, water, hazardous materials, hazardous waste, solid waste, military munitions, and petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL) laws and regulations.  The contractor shall provide these services at U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and other government facilities predominantly in California, to a lesser extent in Arizona, and to an even lesser extent in Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed-price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract not to exceed $20,000,000 or 365 days from the date of contract award, whichever comes first. The government has the option to extend this contract for four additional option periods (365 calendar days for each option). The total maximum value for the base term and all option periods shall not exceed  $100,000,000. The individual delivery order limitation is $5,000,000.

Recent experience documenting innovative cleanup strategies and successful attainment of regulatory closure for CERCLA or RCRA sites should be included. A maximum of 10 projects in total will be evaluated. (2) Professional qualifications and capabilities of the staff to be assigned to this contract. Include experience from January 1995 to January 2003 in performing field investigations and preparing studies/analysis/plans relating to environmental studies and other support services pertaining to CERCLA, RCRA and underground storage tanks. Indicate familiarity with laws and regulations for air, water, hazardous materials, hazardous waste, solid waste, and petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL), and pollution prevention, associated GIS mapping, obtaining environmental permits, and interfacing with regulatory agencies (Federal/ State/ Local) in California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. Experience in California will be weighted more heavily than experience in other states. Resumes for key personnel are limited to one page each and should cite project specific experience. (3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules, and reliability of the firm's quality assurance and quality control program. Document recent awards and commendations (do not submit copies). (4) Location in the general geographic area of Navy and Marine Corps installations in California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana and knowledge of the locality in relation to Navy and Marine Corps installations in California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. Greater weight will be given to location in proximity to Navy and Marine Corps installations in California than in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, but if proximity to installations in California were comparable with that of other firms, closer proximity to installations in Arizona would be an advantage. (5) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is two fold.  First, the Marine Corps Systems Command, is seeking any commercial sources capable of manufacturing sixty-six (66) Bridge Erection Boats (BEB).  The second part of this RFI is to seek sources that can remanufacture the current fleet of sixty-six (66) BEBs.  The purpose of this RFI is to enable the Government to determine if it is more cost effective to purchase sixty-six new BEBs or have the current fleet remanufactured.  Vendors are encouraged to respond to both parts of this two fold RFI. However, responses to only one part are acceptable.  The BEB shall meet the mission needs required by Operating Forces, to include being capable of the movement and placement of floating material, supporting diving operations, maritime projects, inland water patrols, hydrographic survey operations and performing other missions related to military operations afloat.  The BEB essential characteristics shall include: be skid/cradle mountable; provide a minimum of 4400 lbs. thrust forward and a minimum of 2200 lbs. thrust in reverse using a steerable hydro jet propulsion system; utilize JP-8 as fuel; threshold weight of 8800 lbs; not to exceed (NTE) threshold width of 98 inches; NTE threshold length of 324 inches; NTE threshold height of 178 inches with mast extended; minimum capacities of 15 passengers or 4400 lbs. cargo (threshold); draft of no more than 22 inches (no load) or 26 inches with a load of 4400 lbs.; provide a reinforced bow and frame with knees for material handling; capable of resisting corrosion in salt air environment (components be resistant to surface blistering, material loss or breakdown or chalky residue); and coated with water-based, Chemical Agent Resistive Coating (CARC) paint.  Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) with worldwide capability is an important element, as well as commercial warranty services and the ability to provide New Equipment Training (NET).  The remanufacture shall consist of, at a minimum, the replacement of the engine, hydro jets, steering, all gauges and electrical wiring, as well as the refurbishment of the hull.  At this time the Government does not have funding to support the program.  However, for a possible new acquisition, the Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) is involving industry in the early development phases of acquisition planning.  Commercial firms possessing the characteristics noted above are invited to submit the following: (1) Product brochures or marketing materials outlining specifications, to include a statement of capabilities, (2) current GSA contract information regarding unit; technical, operator, maintenance and parts manuals; warranty; New Equipment Training (NET); Contract Logistics Support (CLS) and schedule pricing and (3) corporate history. As part of your response, please include information on delivery/lead time, commercial warranty terms and conditions, worldwide CLS and NET capabilities and any current GSA or other Government Wide Agency Contracts available to order the supplies.  Responses will be reviewed to identify firms potentially capable of fulfilling the Governments requirements.  This sources sought / Request For Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request For Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire follow-on acquisition.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.

The C-9B Phase I / II modified aircraft is a Navy version of the commercially available McDonnell Douglas Corporation DC-9 jet aircraft, with an enhanced cockpit and upgraded avionics suite. 

The following training courses are required: C-9B Pilot Initial Training; C-9B Pilot Recurrent Training; C-9B Crew Chief Initial Training and C-9B Crew Chief Recurrent Training.  The C-9B CACT Pilot and Crew Chief Training program requires classroom (academic and practical) training, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) that depicts all cockpit systems, a Part Task Trainer (PTT) (for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability), and a FAA level D simulator.  NOTE:  ALL FLIGHT SIMULATORS AND TRAINING DEVICES SHALL USE THE NAVY C-9B PHASE I (AFC 130) AND PHASE II (AFC 135) MODIFICATIONS.  THE DEVICES SHALL BE CONTRACTOR-FURNISHED.  THE GOVERNMENT SHALL FURNISH ALL PHASE I AND PHASE II MODIFIED/UPGRADED AVIONICS COMPONENTS APPLICABLE TO THE PHASE I AND II MODIFICATIONS.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL, IF AVAILABLE, ALSO FURNISH LEGACY C-9B COCKPIT COMPONENTS.  In lieu of the CFT or PTT a higher order device may be used.  The flight simulator must be FAA certified to Level D or higher (as defined under FAA Advisory Circular 120-40B) for the McDonnell Douglas Aircraft DC-9 (Navy C-9B Phase I / II) configured cockpit with freeze and repositioning capability.  The pilot courses must be taught at a FAA 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 McDonnell Douglas Corporation DC-9 certified Training Center.  All contractor pilot instructors shall be certified under the 14 CFR Part 142 Training Center certification.  The contractor will be required to submit training syllabus for each course for government approval.  Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.  Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein.  All training courses shall be taught in compliance with the C-9B Model Manager Approved Training Syllabi.

A commercial, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Requirements contract is anticipated with a 60-month period of performance.  The Government anticipates pilot training on the C-9B Phase I / II modified aircraft to commence on or about 3 January 2005.  

All businesses capable of accomplishing the required services are invited to submit literature, brochures, and capability summaries identifying, at a minimum, business size and past (limit to within 3 years) and/or current performance on similar contracts (include dollar value, complexity and point of contact).

<DESC>The United States Postal Service (USPS) currently has a feature on its usps.com web site called the Postal Locator.  The existing Postal Locator has the capability to find the locations of Postal facilities near selected addresses.  The Postal Locator also has a lookup feature that provides the locations of commercial facilities that sell stamps.  Additionally, searches can be conducted for residential and business addresses.  

The USPS intends to identity firms that offer potential for entering into a strategic alliance with the USPS regarding the Postal Locator.  A strategic alliance is a cooperative agreement between the Postal Service and one or more private entities.  Strategic alliances are contractual agreements used to promote marketing initiatives that benefit the Postal Service, enhancing postal business performance through increased revenues, reduced costs, or improved customer satisfaction. They result in partnerships that combine the core strengths, competitive advantages, or needs of the Postal Service with the attributes of other companies for mutual market advantage. As an element of achieving improved customer satisfaction, USPS is seeking to identify potential alliance partners that are capable of providing enhancements to the Postal Locator.  The USPS reserves the right at a future date to structure this transaction under the USPS procurement regulations instead of a strategic alliance.

A summary of the potential enhancements to the Postal Locator is shown in the paragraphs below.  Also presented is a preliminary concept of the potential revenue sharing framework that could be included in a strategic alliance.  

The United States Postal Service (USPS) seeks to learn of capable suppliers for services to update the existing Postal Locator on usps.com. There are three desired components for this locator; 1) the locators visual mapping and location(s) of Postal Retail Offices, Contract Postal Units, and Stamp Consignment Offices, or any place where Postal Services are offered,  2) dealership content on Postal locations and, 3) other directory services such as yellow and white page lookups. The locator content on usps.com will have the look and feel as directed by the Postal Service. The suppliers technology must support providing content to graphical user interfaces managed and hosted by the Postal Service. The requested services must be sustained through a revenue sharing business model.

The mapping application must be able to provide visual maps and driving instructions based on proximity and multiple criteria searches. The user must be able to specify products, services, and location features to narrow the responses of their search. Proximity to origin, specific product type, hours of service, and facility type are examples of criteria the user should be able to pre-define for each locator search.

Once found, the user must be able to get information about that location as if it were a dealership. The service description dealership content must be similar to what would be given if the user called the Postal Service for information about the location. The USPS will provide databases with facility information and the supplier will be responsible for applying Postal data as soon as it becomes available. Additionally, the Application Service Provider (ASP) will geo-code Postal provided locations, reconcile errors, and return to the USPS geo-coding used for provided locations.

Associated directory services, e.g. business yellow pages and/or residential white pages, must also be integrated into the locator content. Any marketing or promotions within the directory services and locator will be at the approval of the USPS. Some competitive and potentially objectionable products, services, or companies will not be approved for use by the USPS.

The Postal Service seeks to establish within the strategic alliance a business relationship that will include a revenue sharing model. This model will be founded on promotional opportunities presented by the locator and directory services content. The USPS will require the supplier to have and maintain an affiliate program, allowing for marketing of affiliates products and services, which comply with USPS requirements. There is a preference for affiliates that support the Postal Service and mailing activities (e.g. office supplies, current affiliates, etc.). These marketing efforts must support the usability of the applications and have a positive revenue return to the Postal Service. Respondents will be required to provide financial analysis demonstrating the methods and viability of the relationship.

Applicants will have until 5 PM (EDT) of the 28th day of March, 2003 to respond with 4 copies containing 15 or less pages of written material, annual reports for the last 2 years, and a list of companies where similar services have been provided. Oral presentations may be requested by the USPS.  

Applications must be submitted to

<SUBJECT>A -- UTILIZATION OF A FIXED DOSE  ALPHA-BLOCKER BPH MEDICATION AS AN ACTIVE COMPARATOR IN A CLINICAL TRIAL OF PHYTOTHERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA
<DESC>This is a request for a Collaborator to provide a fixed daily dose alpha-blocker BPH medication to be used as an active comparator for one arm of a four-arm double-blinded multicenter clinical trial that is designed to compare the long term effects of two phytotherapeutic agents: saw palmetto and pygeum africanum, vs. placebo, on the progression of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia.

INTRODUCTION:  The NIDDK is developing a double-blinded multicenter placebo controlled clinical trial to evaluate the long-term effects of two phytotherapeutic agents: saw palmetto and pygeum africanum on BPH progression as compared to placebo.  A fourth treatment arm of the trial will utilize a single dose BPH specific alpha-blocker as an active comparator to ensure treatment validity of the participant population.  The four-arm trial will enroll approximately 3,000 participants who will be randomized to receive either saw palmetto, pygeum africanum, an alpha-blocker, or placebo. Participants and investigators will be blinded to all treatment agents. Each agent will have a comparable placebo pill.  Enrollment will occur at eleven participating clinical centers.  Central data collection and analysis will occur at the NIDDK funded Data Coordinating Center at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.

STUDY GOAL:  The overall goal of this study is to determine whether either of two commonly used phytotherapy agents have an effect on the progression of the symptoms of BPH over a five year trial period.  The alpha-blocker medication will be used to demonstrate that the cohort of men enrolled in the trial have symptomatic BPH which responds to a known effective therapy.. Each treatment arm will be compared to placebo.  The trial will not be powered for head-to-head comparisons of each treatment arm.  

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  There are no published long-term, placebo-controlled trials of the two phytotherapeutic agents for the treatment of the progression of symptomatic BPH.  This will be the first long-term trial using these two agents, with an active comparator.  The duration of the trial will be five years. The Collaborator providing the alpha-blocker will be expected to provide free active drug and for the duration of the study for approximately 750 enrolled participants, and will be expected to provide free matching placebo for the duration of the study for approximately 2250 participants. The Collaborator will have input into the development of the clinical trial protocol, and will participate in the trial as an ex-officio member of the Steering and Planning Committee, having the same access to trial progress data as the other members of the Steering and Planning Committee. The Collaborator may have access to unblinded data at the completion of the trial at the same time as the participating investigators.  The Collaborator may participate as a member of the publication committee.  The NIDDK Project Scientist will obtain any INDs required for the trial.  The Collaborator will provide NIDDK staff with information and data necessary to meet the FDA IND requirements.

<SUBJECT>A -- TREATMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES IN PEDIATRIC POPULATION:  CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS
<DESC>SUMMARY: The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking proposals from companies in the form of capability statements for Clinical Trials to provide  
1)	insulin,
2)	equipment needed for the care of children with type 2 diabetes (including glucose meters and strips, syringes, lancets, urine ketone strips, concentrated glucose solution for performing oral glucose tolerance tests, topical anesthetic cream for blood drawing, automated blood pressure devices and cuffs, automated scales),
3)	equipment required to measure the effects of lifestyle change (including mechanically breaked cycle ergometers, heart rate monitors and electronic metronomes for performing PWC, accelerometers, pedometers),
4)	materials to create a toolbox to be utilized to enhance the ability of underprivileged children to attain lifestyle changes, particularly increased physical activity (including sneakers, jump ropes, etc.)

STUDY GOAL: The overall goal of this study is to evaluate potential treatment modalities for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, to determine the safest and most efficacious options for treatment. Twelve clinical centers will enroll a total of approximately 750 patients. For medical care, subjects will be seen every 2 months during the first year, and every 3 months during the subsequent years. The total duration of the trial is 5 years. The primary outcome will be related to the achievement and maintenance of glycemic control; numerous important secondary outcomes will also be evaluated, including preservation of beta cell function, side effects and quality of life, markers for vascular complications, and cost effectiveness. 
	Applicants for a Clinical Trial Agreement to support this clinical trial must include a description of the staff with experience and expertise to collaborate in multicenter clinical studies of patients with diabetes. Applicants should provide a detailed description of the materials or equipment to be provided. How the drug or product will be sent to each participating center, as well as packaging, storing and accountability issues must be presented. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS: A selection committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations. It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the selection committee through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria:
1.	The statement should provide specific details about the product to be supplied, particularly any validation of its use in a pediatric population, and in obese subjects, if relevant.
2.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the product in a timely manner for the duration of the study.
3.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator. 

DATES: Only written Clinical Trial capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before April 19, 2003 will be considered. Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement will be invited, at the Collaborators expense, to discuss their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Steering Committee, date and place to be determined. The Institute may issue an additional notice of Clinical Trial opportunity. This notice is directed toward companies with resources to support collaborations.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND QUESTIONS: Capability statements should be submitted to Rochelle Blaustein, J.D., Director, Technology Transfer and Development, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 12 South Drive, MSC 5632, Bethesda, MD  20892-5632, rochelleb@intra.niddk.nih.gov, Fax:  301-402-7461.

USAID will award the contract to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to USAID based on (1) the merits of the offer and (2) the offeror's capability, as explained in the following sections.   

Merits of Offer

USAID will determine the merits of each offer on the basis of: (1) Its acceptability and (2) Its price reasonableness.

a. Acceptability.  USAID will determine the acceptability of each offer on the basis of its compliance with instructions.  
b. Price Reasonableness.  USAID will evaluate the reasonableness of the price of each acceptable offer in relation to the offeror's relative capability. 


Capability of the Offeror

USAID will assess (evaluate) the capability of each offeror on the basis of (a) its organizational experience, and (b) its organizational past performance.  

a. 	Organizational Experience.  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  USAID will evaluate each offeror's experience on the basis of its breath, its depth, and its relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective contract.  Organizations that do not have a past organizational experience record will receive a neutral rating.

b.	Organizational Past Performance   Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  USAID will contact some of the offeror's customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, USAID will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to: other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases.  

Contractors with recent USAID experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided USAID.  USAID will consider the performance that has been previously rendered to USAID to be more influential than past performance from another source.
  

All proposals should be submitted within the content of this solicitation on January 2, 2002 at 4:00 p.m.  Proposals can be submitted via DC mail at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Room 7.10-061, Washington, DC 20523.  POC: Gwendolyn Ruffin or email to gruffin@usaid.gov.  The proposed procurement is 100 percent set-aside for small business concerns. 

The selection will consist of a Best Value source selection process based upon merits of the offer and the offeror's capability.  Under a best value source selection, nonprice evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  USAID will consider an Offeror's past performance and experience to be more important than its price.  However, the USAID will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  In order to select the winning proposal, USAID will rank each offeror by making a series of paired comparisons between them, trading off the marginal differences in capability and the price.  The selection authority will decide whether the marginal difference in capability is worth the marginal difference in price.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation, N00173-03-R-TB05, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 01- 12 and DFARS Change Notice 20030301.  The associated NAICS code is 334516 and small business size standard is 500 employees.  NRL has a requirement for a Particle Analysis System For Small Scale Fire Research. NRL has an on going experimental program to investigate fire suppression phenomena on a scale of centimeters to meters. The primary focus of this work is to improve understanding of the dynamics of water mist as applied to fire suppression. This includes studies of the generation, transport and suppressive effects of mist. Currently active work includes experimental studies of water mist interactions in boundary flow, co flow and counter flow configurations and theoretical investigation of water mist behavior in the boundary layer above burning solids. Complementary engineering experiments with compartment scale systems are also underway, as is research to extend the application of water mist to blast mitigation.

A key variable in this work is the size distribution of the water droplets. For these type of studies, non intrusive sensing, at distances on the order of centimeters to meters, is needed in order to minimize disturbance of the flame and to avoid damage to the instruments. Specific requirements include the ability to measure both size distributions and number densities of droplets having diameters in the range of approximately 1 to 750 Micrometers at droplet mass fractions on the order of 0.1-0.5. The system must also be capable of operating within several centimeters of a flame sources and must be able to generate reports that include particle size distribution histograms and statistics (for example, distribution means, medians and standard deviations). 

In order to meet the requirements of these experiments, the particle analysis system must have the capabilities listed as follows: PARTICLE ANALYSIS SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS

Optical: 1. Ability to measure water droplets having diameters in the range 1 Micrometer to 750 Micrometers. Multiple lens options may be used to achieve this range. 2. Ability to obtain ensemble (vice single particle) size measurements. 3. Measurement regions up to 500 mm in length by 10 mm in diameter.
4. Ability to obtain distribution measurements at high optical obscuration (less than 10 percent transmission).5. Working distance (furthest distance from receiver at which measurements can be made) up to 0.5 meters.


Output: 1. Capable of providing continuous or discrete measurements synchronized to an external trigger. 2. Ability to display droplet distributions and distribution statistics in real time. 3. Ability to analyze and display data off-line 4. Ability to export data in formats compatible with spreadsheets and graphical analysis programs. Mechanical & 

Electrical: 1. Separate transmitter and receiver having mountings compatible with standard optical breadboards. 2. Both the transmitter and receiver mass must be no less than 9 kgm (approximately 20 lb) to permit mounting on two axis stepper platforms.

Environmental: 1. Sealed or purged optics to permit operation in dirty environments. 2. Capable of making measurements in regions within several centimeters of a flame. (2000 kelvins, 1 hr duration)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and FAR 13 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be  issued. 17(ii). The solicitation number USZA22-03-R-0026 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). 17(iii). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-12. 17(iv). This procurement is a small business set aside. All proposals from responsible sources will be fully considered. 17(v) There is an urgent and compelling need for this item. This action is for a quantity of 6 sample items of Titanium NOD Mounts (TTNM). Initial  production quantity is 1000. Maximum quantity over a 5 year ordering period is 10,000. Price structure should be included for quantities of 1 to 10,000. Offerors should provide quantity price breaks. 17(vi) This RFP is for Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) titanium-mounting devices used with present Night Vision systems and the Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH).  
The mounts shall be comprised of titanium metal within the design as part of the material composition. The contractor must determine where the use of titanium best compliments their specific mount design.  Lighter is better if it compliments all of the functional requirements outlined below.  Weight is not a substitute for functional performance.  Offerors must demonstrate the use of titanium through technical drawings, or other documentation that identifies the location of titanium components and material usage.

The titanium device must mount on the Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) and retrofit on helmets already in service.  In order to facilitate this, the mounting device must be compatible with the Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) 3-hole NVG version.  For evaluation, the submitted test articles will be mounted on the ballistic shell presently in service.  In order to receive specifications of shell hole placement for the COTS titanium mounts, the offeror must contact the POC below.  The requested mounting devices will be attached to both Medium and Large MICH ballistic shells for operational evaluation.  Mounting devices, which do not easily fit on the helmet outlined, will not be considered for evaluation.  It is critical that hole placements are identical for the Medium and Large MICH ballistic shells. The helmet geometry is different and it is imperative that Offerors take this into account.
The NOD Mount must interface with the AN/PVS-15 BNVS (Submersible Binocular Night Vision System) and the AN/PVS-18 Night Vision System. The mounts must meet all of the present mounting capabilities such as tilting from the staged helmet position with an easy manual transition to the visual employed position.  The mount must maintain stability in both the ready and employed positions with a solid durable fixed position for operator safety and mission failure avoidance during rigorous use.  It must also have an easy quick disconnect system.  
The mounts will endure a salt-water and petroleum, oils and lubricants (POL) emersion without corrosion. The mounts will be submersed in salt water and standard issue weapon lubricant for a minimum of 30 minutes but not to exceed two hours and evaluated after they are air dried and inspected.   They must not show any signs of visual or employment degradation based on the above stated durability and compatibility requirements.  
The mount kits must include detailed mounting instructions for their particular mounting device and all needed hardware.  All other features/functions are left to the offerors discretion.
(vii)  Delivery of data and samples are due, FOB destination, to POC below.  A minimum of 6 samples of the proposed TTNM for evaluation and capabilities, a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability and a firm fixed price for production units including pricing for 5 years are required.  Production delivery is FOB Destination. Anticipated delivery to Kentucky.
(viii)  FAR provisions and/or clauses referenced can be obtained at http://www.arnet.gov/far/. Solicitation Provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Oct 2000) is hereby incorporated by reference. 17(ix).
