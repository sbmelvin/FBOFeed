<a href="mailto:diane.brazale@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Great Lakes Acquisition Center intends to negotiate a sole source, RFQ contract with the Stratasys Inc. of Eden Prairie, MN for the purchase of an FDM 4000 mc System for the Research Department of the Jesse Brown VAMC, Chicago IL. NAICS 333220  500 Employees. To the best of our knowledge the Stratasys FDM 400mc System is the only system that has the following requirements which will meet the needs of the facility:  1)  The system has the ability to produce three-dimension parts from a digital computer part using rapid prototyping or additive fabrication techniques and polymeric materials,  2) Is capable of building parts with two (multiple) materials simultaneously, one which has engineering properties and the other a soluble in a non-toxic, non-hazardous solution, preferably water, 3) Produces end-use parts with a minimum tensile strength of 5000psi/ 34.5pa with higher strengths preferred of 8000psi or greater, 4) The system does not require any type of post-curing or post-processing of parts other than removal of the support material and 5) Does not require any special storage conditions for the raw material such as a controlled temperature.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes however; any contractor that can meet these requirements are requested to submit clear and convincing evidence of their ability to provide these products. Vendors are required to include but not be limited to manufacturers brochures, system properties and salient characteristics of product. Written notification must be submitted to the Contracting Officer on or before the response due date of this synopsis.  Information can be sent electronically to the Contracting Officer at diane.brazale@va.gov or via mail to the Contracting Officer, VAMC-GLAC, Building 5, 5000 W. National Ave. Bldg. 5, Milwaukee WI 53295.  No telephone requests will be accepted. Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the GLAC will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Stratasys Inc.
