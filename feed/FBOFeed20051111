<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<ARCHDATE>02262006
<CONTACT>Nannette Cicolini, DSN-927-2900
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Center intends to make a sole source award to Allied Aerospace Industries, Inc. (AAI), 703 Middle Ground Blvd, Newport News, VA, 23606-2512, for fabric ation of components of the AH-64 Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) A-kit.  The proposed contractual action will be for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract pursuant to firm fixed priced delivery orders.  The ceiling price of t he contract is $6.5 million with an ordering period of 12 months.  The minimum order under the contract is for the immediate fielding quantity of 27 shipsets and the minimum dollar value of the contract is $500,000.   The ceiling price of the contract is e stablished based upon operations tempo associated with AH-64 aircraft deployment to theaters of operations and the reasonable expectations concerning when the already awarded production contractor for these components will be ramped up and capable of meeti ng a production schedule that satisfies the deployment schedule. Deliveries are required at a rate of  27 per month starting in February 2006.  The AATD has been the developer of the AH-64 A-kit and responsible for the initial production.  The Program Dire ctor - Air Survivability Equipment has contracted for continued production of the CMWS A-kit, but unfortunately these very complex parts require ramping up, and the only way to satisfy the required deployment schedule is for AATD to continue production to meet the gap.  Certain of the components, most of which are composite parts, of the A-kit have been previously acquired from AAI.  Based upon the time constraints, the complexity of the manufacturing, the existence of specialized tooling, the ramp up time associated with developing tooling and formulating specifications and processes for production, the Army intends to purchase the CMWS components from AAI on a sole source basis.  At the earliest opportunity, manufacturing will transition to the existing pr oduction contract.  AATD deems the only feasible action to satisfy the immediate-term requirements and preclude disruption in deployment schedules to be the sole source award to AAI who is deemed to be the only responsible source for these CMWS components.   The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26.  The Government intends to satisfy this s ole source action using Alpha contracting procedures, accordingly a complete solicitation will not be available.  Your written request for the requirements information that is available must be submitted by facsimile at (757) 878-0008 or may be emailed to ncicolini@aatd.eustis.army.mil or dcary@aatd.eustis.army.mil.  This action is subject to export controls imposed by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.  A certified copy of DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement (see Note 8) mu st be submitted along with any written request.   This action is not set aside for small businesses.  Only qualified U.S. sources may participate.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this procurement is 336413.  Th e small business size standard is 1000 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which if received time, shall be considered by the agency.  Notes 8, 22 and 26 apply.
