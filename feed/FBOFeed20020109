However, as proposals become more equal, price becomes more important and may become a determining factor for award. Based on best value, a n award may not necessarily go to the highest rated technical proposal or to the lowest price offer. A tradeoff process may be used to determine the best overall value.

<DESC>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small business to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to assist with the preparation of the project briefs that will serve as the basis of the April 2002 Africa Project Finance Symposium.  The consultant would coordinate with TDA's Africa & Middle East Regional Staff on its recent and current project portfolio and travel to Africa to identify the 15-20 attractive, not yet funded projects that would be the basis of the symposium.  The consultant would also assist TDA and the event logistics contractor with recruitment and the development of a detailed agenda for the event.  The consultant would participate in the symposium.  

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency is organizing a two-day Africa Projects Finance Symposium on behalf of TDA, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im), and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).  The symposium would bring together the three U.S. Government trade finance agencies, select commercial financial institutions, and the sponsors of TDA's most promising Africa projects.  The primary objective is to match interested financiers with attractive projects that offer significant potential for U.S. exports.  Another key objective is promoting the programs of the agencies in an appropriate project finance context for Africa, as well as the common objective to expand business relationships between the U.S. and Africa.  Participation in the event would be by invitation in order to facilitate and focus discussion that advances the projects to financial closure.  The event would take place in late April 2002 in Cape Town, South Africa.

This will be firm fixed price contract not expected to exceed $75,000. 

TDA, located in Arlington, VA, assists in the creation of jobs for Americans by helping U.S. companies pursue overseas business opportunities.  Through the funding of feasibility studies, orientation visits, specialized training grants, business workshops, conferences, and various forms of technical assistance, TDA helps American businesses compete for infrastructure and industrial projects in middle-income and developing countries.

The Small Business Act, at 15, U.S.C. 644, authorizes procuring agencies to aside procurements or portions of procurements for the exclusive participation of Small Businesses Concerns.  

Definition: "Small business concerns" for purposes of TDA award of this total set aside contract means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operating for which it is bidding.  In determining whether dominance exists for TDA's purpose for this contract, consideration is given to annual gross receipts.  Any concern that is annual gross receipts above $5 million dollars, averaged over a three year period, is not considered small and is therefore, NOT eligible for award under this contract.

All participating organizations involved with supplying professional services must be incorporated or chartered in the United States.  Consultants planning teaming arrangements must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens.  In accordance with FAR 19.301, offerors will be required to submit self certification relating to business size.  The competitive proposals method of solicitation as set forth in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1) shall be utilized for this procurement.  This solicitation in no way obligates TDA to award a contract, nor does it commit TDA to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal.  Any explanation desired by an offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of this solicitation must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for reply to reach the offerors before submission of their offerors.  All oral explanations or instruction, given before award of this contract will not be binding.  Any information given to a pr

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>The FAA had issued 3 public announcements recently (5/29/01, 9/20/01, & 10/4/01) regarding a possible competitive acquisition to replace the Aeronautical Information System (AIS) program.  Subsequent to these announcements, the FAA has made an acquisition strategy decision that all requirements currently satisfied by a contractor provided, operated, and maintained Aeronautical Information System (AIS) can be satisfied by enhancing another FAA National Airspace System (NAS) subsystem called the NAS Aeronautical Information Management Enterprise System (NAIMES). The existing NAIMES Task Order with EDS will be modified under the existing GSA FEDSIM contract to encompass the AIS program. <P> Accordingly, we wish to express our thanks to all contractors that expressed an interest, responded to the market survey or participated in the one-on-one meetings.  Responses to the market survey and the one-on-one discussions were very helpful in refining the FAA's requirements and in developing its acquisition strategy.  We believe that our decision significantly reduces technical and schedule risks while also decreasing life cycle costs.  It also moves us closer to accomplishing security and configuration management goals for the NAS. <P> No response to this announcement is necessary.  Questions may be addressed to the current AIS Contracting Officer, Maryanne Austin, at Federal Aviation Administration, ASU-330, 800 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, DC 20591, or at maryanne.austin@faa.gov. <P>

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO DTFH61-02-Q-00020 (Standards Boulevard Exhibit):

This notice serves as an amendment to solicitation DTFH61-02-Q-00020 (Foster the Development of the Standards Boulevard), released by the US DOT Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and posted on FedBiz on December 31, 2001. All conditions and requirements of the solicitation remain unchanged with the exception of the following three items: 

1.	Submission Deadline (date by which proposals are due to the US DOT)

Original date: January 25, 2002
Amended date: March 1, 2002*

2.	Notification Deadline (date by which the US DOT notifies applicants of acceptance into the Standards Boulevard Program)

Original date: February 4, 2002
Amended date: April 5, 2002*

3.	Deployment Schedule (list of events where the Standards Boulevard exhibit would appear)

Original Deployment Schedule:  ITS America Annual Meeting, April 2002; ITE Annual Meeting, August, 2002; ITS World Congress, October, 2002.

Amended Deployment Schedule:  2003 annual meetings of ITS America, ITE, AASHTO, and ATSSA.* 

*The kick-off event for the Standards Boulevard is driven by the availability of ITS devices that demonstrate a level of interoperability and interchangeability through the use of standards. The ITS Standards Program staff has determined that additional time is needed for defining these levels and for determining what levels are desired to be demonstrated in the Boulevard exhibit. The Program staff has concluded that the idea of the Boulevard is likely premature for the ITS America Annual Meeting in April 2002 and possibly for the remainder of the 2002 schedule outlined in the solicitation. Thus the ITS/JPO is proposing 1) a longer time for the submission of proposals and, 2) a partner kick-off at the ITS America Annual Meeting in April 2002. At that time, program staff will have a clearer understanding of the timeline that will allow the Standards Boulevard to move forward. 


ORIGINAL SOLICITATION:
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)/Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS/JPO) is seeking partners to foster the development of the Standards Boulevard.  The Standards Boulevard, ("Boulevard") is a new initiative that requires the participation and support of the vendor community to fully achieve its desired objectives of informing and educating the transportation community about ITS standards.

The purpose of this Request for Partner Proposals (RFPP) is to introduce the Standards Boulevard Program to the vendor community, to describe how the Boulevard is envisioned to operate in the short- and long-term, and to provide information about how a vendor can apply to become a Standards Boulevard partner. (NOTE:  Download this solicitation in its entirety for the complete RFPP and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).

The JPO believes that the Boulevard will provide a mechanism through which the U.S. DOT and the vendor community can accomplish complementary goals. A greater understanding of ITS standards and the solutions ITS can offer to the transportation community will lead to a greater demand for ITS products and services. 

Your interest in this proposal is most welcomed by the ITS/JPO. All interested parties should submit their proposal in accordance with the attached RFPP.  The MOU and RFPP and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the Electronic Posting System (EPS) under FedBizOpps at www.eps.gov.  Choose the "EPS for Vendors" option followed by selection of the DOT/FHWA section.  The related documents will be posted under RFQ number DTFH61-02-Q-00020.  
Note:  This is a request for partnership and contribution of resources. This solicitation will not result in a funded contract. This solicitation encourages collaboration rather than competition.  

The JPO acknowledges the unique nature of the RFPP and the contributions being sought, and is eager to work

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought 
Synopsis for two acquisitions. Detailed information on both the LRIP and REDI acquisitions can be found at: http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixslibr/F22-LRIP-REDI. The F-22 System Program Office (SPO), Aeronautical System Center (ASC), is planning for the F-22 REDI Contract and the F-22 LRIP aircraft and associated equipment and program support for Lots 4 and 5.  The F-22 aircraft blends low observability with advanced avionics, a 
highly maneuverable lightweight airframe, and the ability 
to supercruise.  The F-22 is designed to detect, engage, 
and destroy an opposing force before detection.  Further, 
the F-22 possesses air-to-air as well as air-to-ground 
capability.  Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (LM Aero), 
Marietta, GA, is currently the prime contractor for the 
engineering and manufacturing development of the F-22 
aircraft as well as the production of Production 
Representative Test Vehicles (PRTV), PRTV II, and LRIP Lots 
1,2, and 3.  Responsible sources are sought for follow on 
development and Lots 4 and 5.  Offerors must provide 
written notice to the respective contracting officer of 
their interest and capability to satisfy the government 
requirement no later than 08 Feb 2002. The anticipated fifty-nine (59) aircraft (27 in Lot 4 and 32 in Lot 5) are a part of the LRIP phase of F-22 program with delivery dates beginning in November 2005 and continuing through October 2007.  
The responses for Lot 4, solicitation number F33657-02-R-
0010, and Lot 5, solicitation number F33657-02-R-0010, 
should be concise, program specific and include all areas:  
(1) possess program management, fabrication/assembly, and 
quality assurance personnel; (2) possess the material, 
engineering, factory and flight test equipment and physical 
facilities; (3) be a responsible contractor with 
demonstrated recent total aircraft system responsibility; 
(4) be capable of delivering qualified aircraft in 
accordance with the above schedule; and (5) include in 
their response this notice evidence of these capabilities.  
The offeror shall also indicate their size status in 
relation to NAICS 336411.  Reprocurement data is not 
available.  Note that the production of the supplies listed 
requires a substantial initial investment or an extended 
period of preparation for manufacture.  Also, it is 
impractical to distribute the applicable specification with 
this market survey.  These contract documents may be 
examined or obtained from ASC/YF, Building 553, 2725 C 
Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433. Additional information for Lots 4 and 5, please contact Pam Bickel, Contract Negotiator, 
ASC/YFK, (937) 904-5350 or Patti Blakely, Contracting 
Officer, ASC/YFK, (937) 904-5351.

The REDI contract, solicitation number F33657-02-R-0009, 
will provide for the development of integrated software and 
hardware upgrades to the Lockheed Martin developed F-22 
weapon system including flight test support at Edwards AFB, 
CA.  Development of system upgrades include correcting 
existing defects, changing the system to incorporate new 
requirements, and changing the system to add capability and 
enhance performance. Lockheed Martin has been the sole 
designer, manufacturer and integrator of the F-22 weapon 
system since the program-s inception.  
Contractors interested in this effort must submit the 
following information for evaluation to the Government.  
Responses should be concise, program specific and include 
all areas:  (1) description of existing F-22 or similar 
comparable weapon system experience in the integration and 
certification of software and hardware upgrades systems; 
(2) demonstrate management, logistics, engineering,

GENERAL The New York District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (District) is in the process of developing the execution plan for the $1.8 billion New York & New Jersey Harbor Deepening Project (“Project”) for the deepening of various channels within the Port of New Y ork and New Jersey to a depth of 50 feet or more.  The project will include the dredging of soft silts, clay, sand, gravel, glacial till and rock. It is anticipated that drilling and blasting of rock will be required in order to achieve the required excavated depth. Placement of the dredged material will b e at either upland sites, the Historic Area Remediation Sites (HARS), an aquatic placement site and/or at artificial reefs. The New York and New Jersey Harbor Deepening project will include dredging of the following channels to the required depths indicated below. In addition to the required depths below, 1.5 feet of paid overdepth will be permitted.

Recent, Holocene sediments consist of loose to dense Sand and very soft to stiff Silt and Clay.   Pleistocene sedi ments consist of moderately dense to very dense Sand and Gravel (Till) and soft to very stiff Silt and Clay.  Cobbles and Boulders are common within the Pleistocene section.  The most common bedrock types are Shale, Sandstone, Diabase, and Serpentinite.  T he following table displays an estimate of the various soil types and bedrock that will be encountered in each of the navigation channels.

<SUBJECT>B -- SOLE SOURCE MODIFICATION
<DESC>The Clean Water Act (CWA) mandates that Environmental Protection Agency restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.  One of the primary tasks associated with this effort is to eliminate or control the discharge of pollutants, particularly toxic pollutants, into the Nation's waterways.  The Office of Water, Engineering and  Analysis Division, is responsible for the development of national technology-based effluent regulations, e.g., the national categorical effluent limitations guidelines and standards.  These limitations and standards are established by this program for all facilities which discharge or may discharge directly into waterways of the United States, or which indirectly discharge or may discharge into publicly owned treatment works.  Contract 68-C5-0005 provides technical support to EAD to enable EPA to establish and defend the effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the  Metal Products and Machinery (MP&M) Point Source Category.  After lengthy negotiations with NRDC, EPA filed an unopposed motion in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to modify the Consent Decree to, among other things, merge the two phases of the MP&M effluent guideline and modify the dates for proposal and final action.  The combined MP&M regulation was proposed in October 2000 with December 2002 as the date for final promulgation.  Contract 68-C5-0005 currently consists of a base period with six one-year option periods.  Due to the extensive effort required to compile the regulatory record for the proposed rule, categorize and respond to comments upon the proposed rule, perform sampling episodes, and site visits, additional effort is required.  The US EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, an increase to the Level-Of-Effort for this contract by 10,000 hours for Option Period 6 of the contract.   Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 42 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), which allows for negotiations without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source.  The basis for this determination is that only ERG can provide the continuity to complete the remaining complex technical work.  The remaining technical support efforts are characterized by multiple, concurrent and sequential, interrelated engineering tasks and activities.  To develop coherent, well-documented engineering analyses and defensible rulemaking records it is necessary to utilize the same contract personnel throughout the rulemaking process.  In addition, the Agency is still in the process of selecting technology options for the MP&M subcategories.  The contractor that developed the cost modules and pollutant loading reduction databases would provide optimum performance in providing appropriate analyses for the option selection process.  Any delay in these technical analyses and option selection process would cause EPA to miss its court-ordered deadline for the notice of proposed rulemaking.  A new resource would result in a duplication of previous effort and as such cost.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  Sources wishing to be considered must submit documentation to the office identified above which establishes that (1) the company has the expertise to meet the contract technical requirements; (2) it has the facilities and personnel available; and (3) that it can provide continuity in the studies and analysis required to meet the regulatory mandates and maintaining the reliability of the data without duplication of costs or effort.  Documentation should be submitted within 15 days of publication of this notice.  See notes 22 and 26.

<SUBJECT>D -- Bi-Directional Exchange Information and Methodology
<DESC>Special Notice:

THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for Bi-Directional Exchange Information and Methodology.  NO SOLICATION EXISTS; THEREFORE, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the FBO.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Federal Grant Streamlining Program (FGSP), is currently researching potential business solutions for support of a common application and reporting system for Federal financial assistance management.  The Federal Grant Streamlining Program is a Federal government-wide effort authorized by Public Law 106-107, the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999, to improve the effectiveness and performance of Federal financial assistance programs, simplify Federal financial assistance application and reporting requirements, improve the delivery of services to the public, and facilitate greater coordination among those responsible for delivering such services.

DHHS is interested in industry's capability to develop tools to enable the Federal government to electronically receive grant applications and reports.  Specifically, the FGSP is exploring the capability to conduct electronic grants (e-Grants), using existing desktop, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, and web-based/web-enabled applications.  E-Grants, in this context is the ability to electronically publicize grant opportunities, receive applications of various sizes from state and local governments, non-profit, and for-profit entities and send/issue resulting grants, as well as subsequent reporting and grant administration tasks using HTML, XML, and EDI formats.  Applications are submitted using designated Federal government forms. or documents.   Any proposed tool must create a package of forms and documents that can be secured from tampering after being signed by the initiator.  Any proposed tool should allow for these documents to be exchanged electronically, legally sustainable, and provide assurance that:  1) the person/entity exchanging the information is in fact who they are representing themselves to be, 2) the information exchanged can only be received by the person/entity for whom the information is intended, and 3) the information has not been changed since moving from the originator to the receiving party.  Electronic signature software is one method for providing such assurances.  Proposed tools to receive electronic applications must consider the limitations of the various email and web-based systems.  Also, such electronic applications must be able to be transported securely to a location accessible only to the Federal government-granting agency.  

Implementation across the Federal government is essential to DHHS; therefore tools should be easily introduced and implemented across agencies.   Electronic tools must be easily utilized at no or little cost, to the extent necessary, by entities submitting applications.  Consideration should be given to interoperability across all phases of the grant lifecycle.  IN ADDITION, LONG-TERM COSTS OF MAINTENANCE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.

DHHS, FGSP is most interested and strongly encourages your insight, comments, and creative suggestions in this matter.  Even if your company only distributes the product, or provides a single element of the bi-directional exchange process, feel free to give us feedback with what you could provide.  In addition, your company's ability to provide us any information or networking leads as to what partnering relationships and innovative approaches other organizations are implementing to this end would be appreciated.  Share-in-savings, or cooperative agreements are encouraged.  GENERAL MARKETING LITERATURE IS DISCOURAGED, AND WILL NOT RECEIVE CONSIDERATION.  SERIOUS respondents are invited to
