<SUBJECT>Evaluation of Rapid HIV Self-Testing among MSM in High Prevalence Cities
<SOLNBR>2011-N-13417
<CONTACT>Jerry W. Outley, Contracting Officer, Phone 770-488-2831, Fax 770-488-2868, Email jmo4@cdc.gov
<DESC>C.1 BACKGROUND AND NEED
<p>Innovative testing strategies are needed to reduce levels of undiagnosed HIV infection and increase early access to treatment. The availability of a HIV self-test may facilitate access to testing among individuals who have never been tested due to concerns about privacy and confidentiality and may increase compliance with current CDC HIV testing recommendations for those who require regular testing due to on-going risk behavior. Rapid HIV self-tests may play an important role in efforts to reduce both HIV morbidity and mortality. Self-test HIV kits may reduce HIV incidence by helping HIV-negative persons remain free from infection (primary prevention), as well as increase early diagnoses of those who are infected (secondary prevention). Policies that guide the public-health application and use of rapid HIV self-test kits, require data on whether persons at high risk for infection will use these tests, the effectiveness of the tests for primary and secondary prevention, and the utility of the tests in promoting additional testing and linkage to HIV services of persons with preliminary positive results.</p>
<p>Repeat testing may be particularly important for men who have sex with men (MSM) at high risk of transmitting HIV since infections in the earliest stages are associated with high viral loads and potential for transmission. MSM account for nearly half of the more than one million people living with HIV in the U.S. and they account for more than half of all new HIV infections in the U.S. each year. While MSM account for just 4 percent of the U.S. male population aged 13 and older, the rate of new HIV diagnoses among MSM in the U.S. is more than 44 times that of other men. MSM are the only risk group in the U.S. in which new HIV infections are increasing. While new infections have declined among both heterosexuals and injection drug users, the annual number of new HIV infections among MSM has been steadily increasing since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The exceptionally high prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection among MSM and plausibly high transmission risks to partners who are attempting to avoid infection through HIV-negative serosorting, suggests that MSM and their partners stand to benefit the most from a rapid HIV self test. This is especially true for black and Hispanic MSM. One report suggests that young black MSM have nearly 7-times greater adjusted odds for being unaware of their HIV infection relative to young white MSM. Despite this racial disparity, young black MSM (relative to young white MSM) are equally likely to perceive themselves at low risk for infection and are nearly equally as likely to disclose being HIV-negative to new sex partners. Of black MSM with HIV who were unaware of their infection, up to 22% of their new partners reported being HIV-negative. However, of Hispanic and white MSM with HIV who were unaware of their infection, only 3% of new partners of Hispanic MSM and 4% of new partners of white MSM disclosed being HIV-negative.</p>
<p>As of March 2011, the FDA has approved several rapid HIV tests for use at point-of-care to aid in the diagnosis of HIV. Several of these tests have received Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) waiver for use in non-clinical settings by persons without formal laboratory training and they are accurate, safe, and simple to use. Currently, OraSure Inc. has applied to the FDA for an over-the-counter (OTC) labeling of OraQuick Advance.</p>
<p>While manufacturers that seek OTC labeling of rapid HIV tests are obligated to conduct studies to meet FDA requirements on device safety and accuracy, manufacturers will not be required to conduct studies that evaluate the public-health benefit of these tests. Thus, without CDC-supported research, data will not exist to guide the development of public-health policy and programs on the dissemination and use of OTC rapid HIV self tests when they become available. In the absence of such guidelines, CDC will not be able to take full advantage of a promising new application of rapid HIV tests for primary and secondary prevention efforts targeting persons at high risk for infection.</p>
<p>Given the unrelenting HIV crisis among MSM and the imminent release into the market of rapid HIV self-test kits, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of providing rapid HIV self-test kits on repeat HIV testing, linkage to care, partner testing, serosorting, and HIV sexual risk behaviors among MSM to determine the potential primary and secondary prevention effectiveness of OTC rapid HIV self tests. This information will assist DHAP in developing recommendations and future research and program needs concerning self-testing for MSM to aid in identifying undiagnosed cases of HIV infection and promoting linkage to care of persons with HIV.</p>
<p><br />C.2 PURPOSE/PROJECT OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to assess the use and impact of rapid HIV self-testing among MSM located in up to three high HIV prevalence cities in the United States. <br />The primary research questions to be addressed by the contractor are:<br />1. Does provision of self-test kits increase the frequency of HIV testing among high-risk MSM to at least three times in 12 months?<br />2. What proportion of persons with a preliminary positive result go on to request, be referred to, and access follow-up testing and care services (e.g., primary care provider, health department, or local AIDS service provider)? <br />3. Does the provision of self test kits to high-risk HIV-negative or unknown serostatus MSM increase the distribution and use of rapid HIV self-test kits to their social and sexual network affiliates?<br />4. Does the provision of self-test kits to HIV-positive MSM increase the distribution and use of test kits to their social and sexual network affiliates?<br />5. Does the provision of self-test kits change sexual behaviors among study participants (e.g. number of partners, unprotected anal intercourse, and serosorting practices)?<br />6. How do program participants perceive the possible uses, benefits and drawbacks of self testing and what are participant's self-testing preferences, in terms of accessing kits, cost, HIV information, and access to supportive services?</p>
<p>The contractor shall recruit a minimum of 3,200 high-risk MSM who are HIV negative or of unknown serostatus, and a minimum of 300 HIV positive MSM (based upon self-report). (Using a binary outcome of success as having &ge;3 HIV tests per year and the chi-square test at the 5% significance level, we have 90% power to detect a difference between the comparison and intervention groups if the success rates in these groups are 5% and 10% respectively. We inflated the sample size to allow for a maximum 40% attrition rate). Of these men, at least 20% shall be black MSM and 15% shall be Hispanic MSM to allow for appropriate analytical comparisons. To be eligible for the study, participants must be: MSM who are age 18 and over; reside in the participating jurisdiction(s) proposed by contractor and approved by COTR; and report unprotected anal sex with more than one male partner in the past year. Recruitment of subjects shall begin approximately 18 months after award, depending on receipt of required approvals to begin research study. Recruitment of study subjects shall be completed within 9 months. An additional 14 months shall be used to complete the 12 month follow-up period for all subjects. Therefore, all research activities shall be completed within 4 years.</p>
<p>The research study will consist of three study conditions that are based on a participant's disclosure of HIV status at time of enrollment. HIV negative and unknown status subjects shall be randomized to one of two study conditions: an intervention or comparison condition. HIV positive participants will not be randomized but assigned to a third study condition. The contractor shall recruit participants via the internet, and potentially other methods. The contractor shall develop and maintain a web-based system where interested participants will access a secure internet study specific website where screening, enrollment, consent, randomization and assessments will occur. In addition to conducting a baseline assessment, the contractor shall develop and maintain a web-based system where all participants complete follow-up assessments to be conducted at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment. The contractor shall provide participants with incentives following completion of each assessment so that the study will achieve an anticipated retention rate of 80% at each follow-up point. The contractor shall randomize the HIV-negative/unaware participants into two study arms after completing the baseline assessment. The contractor shall provide (mail or email) participants in the comparison condition with a resource page/brochure containing information on local HIV testing and other support services for MSM. The contractor shall provide participants in the intervention condition and all HIV-positive arm participants with up to 5 rapid test kits (by mail) and the resource brochure (by mail or email), upon request, at each assessment point. The contractor shall provide thethe option of requesting a kit that allows oral fluid collection or blood (finger-stick) collection. The contractor shall have a mechanism to assist person with preliminary positive results with counseling, referral, and assistance to accessing testing and care services. The contractor shall develop and maintain a web-based system where all persons who use the self-test kits can enter the result of the test and provide feedback on their experience with using the test kit. All persons who use the self-test kit, have a preliminary positive result, and contact the study counselor/referral coordinator by phone or email will be referred or if requested, provided assistance with linkage to local services by the contactor to a local site for appropriate follow-up testing and care services.</p>
<p>The study also includes a qualitative component to better understand how participants used the test kits, attitudes about self-testing, perceived benefits and drawbacks of self-testing, unintended consequences, and preferences for future program implementation. Five focus groups will be conducted in each participating city (k=15) with a total of approximately 50 men per city. Participants assigned to the intervention arm will be invited to indicate their interest in participating in a focus group discussion after completing the 12 month survey. After a sufficient number of potential focus group participants have been accrued, study staff will randomly select a sample to follow-up to ascertain interest and availability. Contractor staff shallshall travel, as needed to each study city to conduct and record the face-to-face focus groups. Other mechanisms for convening participants (e.g., online focus groups, conference calls or online chats) can be discussed. The contractor shall implement a mechanism to ensure focus group participation. The contractorshall record and transcribe discussions, enter the data into a qualitative software analysis program, and conduct analysis. A written summary of the qualitative findings, the analytic database, transcripts, and audio-recordings shall be supplied to CDC by the Contractor.. <br />Specific objectives of the contract include the following:<br />1. Obtain and confirm required Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Office of management and Budget (OMB) approvals.<br />2. Design, develop and implement a secure study website to include a participant recruitment interface.<br />3. Develop and implement internet capable screening, enrollment, and consent procedures. <br />4. Develop and implement a web-based data collection system for all quantitative data activities (surveys and test results from self-test kits).<br />5. Develop and implement a participant tracking system which securely houses participant contact information (e.g., names, email address, mailing address, phone number), and automates reminder email notifications.<br />6. Develop and implement a confidential rapid HIV self-test kit and delivery system according to study protocol.<br />7. For persons testing preliminary positive, develop and implement a counseling, referral and linkage system protocol that includes supplemental testing. <br />8. Develop and implement a system to routinely monitor the progress of the accrual of study participants and make adjustments as necessary.<br />9. Conduct focus groups.<br />10. Produce interim and final progress reports.<br />11. Create and deliver semi-annual data sets and final data sets. Create and deliver a final report of the qualitative findings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br />C.3 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The contractor will implement a three condition research study using a protocol developed by the contractor and approved by CDC. The study will assess the impact of providing rapid HIV self-test kits to MSM, coupled with phone-based counseling and referral to local testing and care services. Research activities shall be conducted in at least one, and up to three of the top 10 US jurisdictions with the highest HIV prevalence rates among MSM. In this study, CDC will not be engaged in counducting research activities and CDC staff will not have access to personal identifiable information. Therefore, CDC IRB will not be obtained. This study will identify and quantify the use of the HIV self-test kits, changes in sexual behaviors, changes in HIV testing practices, and the use of phone-based counseling, supplemental testing and linkage to care. The contractor shall produce a final report and final dataset to be submitted to CDC at the end of the contract.</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR INDUSTRIAL SUPPORT SERVICES
This is a market survey for Industrial Support Services.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing Industrial Support Services.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 811213, Communication Equipment Repair and Maintenance, with a size standard of $10.0 Million.   
ALL interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:        Type of services provided by your firm,         Size and type of services provided by   previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance),         Number of years in business
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
Attached is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments. 
All responses to this market survey must be received by 1:00 pm, CDT, August 9, 2011.   All submittals should be submitted to:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Synopsis

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), Eatontown, NJ 07724, intends to procure a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software product or software toolset with minor customization to meet the VA needs for an integrated Quality Management System (iQMS).  The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is implementing International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2008 standards and quality management systems beginning with all Sterile Processing Department (SPD) and Reusable Medical Equipment (RME) departments in order to provide increased reliability and safety of SPD/RME services. To support the ISO 9001:2008 implementation, an improved enterprise record infrastructure for management review and governance of the ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System (QMS) is needed.  

A solicitation is anticipated to be issued as a request for proposal (RFP) from the VA TAC, under solicitation number VA118-11-RP-0446, to be released on, or about, July 13, 2011. This effort is anticipated to be competed as a 100% Total Small Business Set-Aside under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541511, which has a corresponding small business size standard of $25M average annual revenue.

This proposed action will have one (1) twelve (12) month base period, and four (4) twelve (12) month option periods, and is anticipated to be awarded as a Firm-Fixed-Price contract.

The primary place of performance will be at the Contractor's facility and at the Austin, Texas, Government hosting facility for the testing, training, pre-production, and production technical installation of the software.  Remote support will also be provided to the Government's hosting facility in Austin, Texas; pilot sites; and one hundred sixty-five (165) parent locations across the VHA enterprise.  Each parent location could have multiple geographic locations for departments that perform reusable medical equipment services.

This announcement serves as a notice for a proposed requirement, and does not constitute as a Request for Proposal, or a guarantee that a solicitation will be issued. 

The Points of Contact for this action are Brian Triggiano, Contract Specialist, brian.triggiano@va.gov and Charles Ross, Contracting Officer, charles.ross@va.gov.

<DESC>Request for Qualified US Domestic Manufacturers of Retortable MRE (Meals Ready-to-Eat) Pouch Film Sources.
<p>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Subsistence is seeking proposals from interested parties for domestically manufactured US-based sources of retortable MRE (Meal Ready-to-Eat) pouch film in either roll stock for converting or pre-formed pouch form. The requirement is that the pouch materials meet the new linear tear requirements and perform without defects after ultrasonic sealing. The domestic supplier of this US manufacturer of retortable material must meet the requirements of MIL-PRF-44073G which can be found at: http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/subs/support/specs/pcrs/mre/mre30/44073G.pdf</p>
<p>It is preferred that the US-based source be experienced in Government contracting specifications with DLA Troop Support Subsistence. The company must be a domestic manufacturer of linear tear film that can be retorted. Please indicate your Government contract number or food manufacturer vendor you have supplied with film similar to what is described in this announcement. Include a brief description of retortable linear tear film items supplied when replying to this announcement. The potential domestic supplier may need to have these films certified by Natick Soldier Systems Center: http://www.army.mil/info/organization/natick/.</p>
<p>Currently, a need exists for US based suppliers that manufacture this retortable pouch material to maintain a domestic source for our producers. DLA Troop Support Subsistence can then maintain competition and Industrial Base coverage of surge and sustainment requirements. The successful firm will be responsible for demonstrating that the film they produce is domestically made and meets the Government's specification standards.</p>
<p>A variety of the products that are purchased and made by our contractors that will use these films are listed here: http://www.dscp.dla.mil/subs/rations/programs/index.asp</p>
<p>Please provide a statement which describes, in detail, the US location, your firm's capabilities and how your firm will manufacture this film that meets the specifications listed. Do you have similar films that will meet our requirements? Are they domestically manufactured? The Government may be willing to provide a small amount of funding to support a firm in this endeavor. If a firm requires funding, please provide specific details in the proposal. Preference will be given to those firm(s) who do not require funding from the Government.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make one award, multiple awards or none at all.</p>
<p>Proposals, as well as any questions, may be directed to peter.laverghetta@dla.mil by the closing date of Monday July 11, 2011.</p>

The sensor must be constructed of corrosion resistant materials, be suitable for use with oily waste water and seawater, and meet Navy shock grade B and vibe requirements type II. The sensor should be able to handle ambient temperatures as high as 2000 F and fluid temperatures ranging from 400 to 1200 F.
 An ambient temperature range of -400 to 1600 F is desired for electronic components. The sensor must be able to utilize a power supply of 120VAC, 60Hz.  The electronics will be connected to the OWS model OPB-10NP control panel.  The sensor must include or be compatible with a time delay to allow the pump to run for 2 minutes at start-up to establish suction, but alarm and cause a pump shut-down at any time after two minutes if a no flow condition is detected.  

Submissions for this announcement shall include the following information 

1. Past experience with manufacturing and qualification testing of similar types of flow sensors and switches including details of products and capabilities.
 This shall include experience with flow sensor performance in various types of petroleum products, and material compatibility including fresh and salt water contaminations. In addition, production flexibility, the cost of relatively small production runs 1000 elements per year, warranties, and customer Points of Contact, including phone numbers, shall be provided. 

2. An estimate of parts support, upgrades, and improvements expected over a 20 year life expectancy. A description of preventive and corrective maintenance required over the life of the sensor.

3. A wiring diagram sufficient to understand the controls provided with the sensor and to determine how to connect the sensor to the OWS model OPB-10NP.

This is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to the award of a contract.
 Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this announcement nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: 

This is a request for information (RFI) surrounding a potential tactical waveform embedded sleeve.  The idea is to leverage existing tactical waveforms to provide dismounted warfighters the ability to transport handheld device traffic.  The Marine Corps is interested in solutions that facilitate a wireless connection between handheld devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, etc.) and inherent tactical networks.  The solution should provide a wireless transport medium to facilitate communications in austere environments where traditional commercial signals lack the ability to maintain a high level of availability and a low probability of detection, interception, exploitation, and jamming.
 

BACKGROUND:

During on-the-move operations, in either mounted or dismounted environments, Marines continually lack the ability to leverage ubiquitous network connectivity to access relevant mission data.  This RFI is seeking solutions to connect, via wireless communications, the Marines on the ground (i.e., battalion and below) with the higher, adjacent, and supporting echelons.  This solution is focused on providing a data channel for the highly mobile troops.

REQUEST FOR GENERAL INFORMATION:

1.  Describe your organization.
2.  Describe your organizations developmental experience surrounding tactical communication technology.
3.  Describe the market (i.e., government or commercial) that your technology might support.
  Describe the level of demand requiring this type of technology.
4.  Is there potential for a legitimate market outside of the military?  What requirements should exist to ensure a larger market?
5.  What political or organizational considerations are needed to produce an optimal solution? 

GENERAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

The ideal technical solution should meet these minimal requirements.

1.  The sleeves leveraged signal must be interoperable with inherent Maine Corps tactical waveforms.
2.  The sleeve should only connect to the handheld via a wired connection.
3.  The sleeve should contain an independent battery to support the power requirements of the on-board tactical waveform.
4.
  The sleeve components must maintain a modular design to support various form factors.
5.  The sleeve design must support various sizes and shapes to rapidly adjust based on the commercial markets handheld devices.

REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL INFORMATION:

1.  Describe your solution that might solve the highlighted problem. 
2.  Provide a detailed description and drawing(s) to illustrate a proposed solution.
3.  What technologies lack maturity to produce an optimal solution?
4.  What technical information is needed to produce an accurate (i.e., considering cost, schedule, and performance) proposal?
5.  What is the smallest form factor sleeve that can host traditional smartphone-like handhelds?
6.
  Given your proposed solution, what power limitations are expected?
7.  Given your proposed solution, what handheld characteristics are required?
8.  Of the requirements listed in the general technical requirements section, which ones are infeasible and alternatively which ones are missing?

REQUEST FOR BUSINESS AND LOGISTICAL INFORMATION

1.  How much would your proposed solution cost?
2.  What is the production lead time for your proposed solution?  How long would your proposed solution take to produce fieldable implementations? 
3.  What limitations might delay fielding? 
4.  What logistical issues should be considered?

Upon completion of a site visit, the Contractor shall provide a comprehensive written report that outlines the strengths and weaknesses of each HRPP.  When the HRPP has met the Contractor's requirements to become accredited, the Contractor certifies that the HRPP meets accreditation standards.  After initial accreditation, the reaccreditation process shall be performed for each VA facility at least once every five years.  Over a period of five years, the Contractor will be responsible for implementing the accreditation or reaccreditation process for an average of approximately 22 VA facilities' HRPPs per year.  The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, materials, and supplies necessary for the full participation of all VA facilities with HRPPs (and the VA facilities with FWAs they encompass) in the accreditation process.

<DESC>The USDA, Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) , Technical Services Division (TSD) intends to issue a sole source award using commercial and simplified acquisition procedures for a LECO TruMac Nitrogen/Protein Macro Determinator system, Item # TRMNLC with accessories and maintenance services. The Government believes that this instrument is currently the only CNA offered commercially that allows for large (greater than or equal to 3 grams) sample sizes for analysis of non-homogeneous grain samples in less than 4 minutes. The system will provide reference protein analysis on grains and other processed products and is the only provider for such an instrument that will meet all GIPSA requirements. The larger sample offers a significant increase in accuracy and precision in the determination of protein present in the sample, which is essential for GIPSA to maintain the national official protein services to facilitate grain marketing.
<p>To ensure standardization of testing non-homogeneous grain samples, it is essential that FGIS use a LECO TruMac Nitrogen/Protein Macro Determinator system, Item # TRMNLC. However, no equivalent is known. <br /><br />The proposed contract action is for products for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

Contractors outside of this area may fly to our site on a given day only to find that conditions, such as wind, have changed during the transit time.
Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the requirements of this procurement shall submit a capabilities statement by email to shannon_blackburn@fws.gov no later than July 5, 2011 at 3:00PM PST.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<p>Mfr: Sun/Oracle<br />Justification for Brand Name Only: The agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by the unique supplies or services available from Sun/Oracle directly or its list of Federal Certified Oracle resellers, who possess the unique capabilities demonstrated as follows: If the contract requirement is not met by the OEM or certified vendors, two problems can arise. One, Sun/Oracle will not add the equipment to the master list for annual maintenance due to the fact that in full and open completion there are vendors that sell refurbished as well as Black/Gray market equipment that does not meet the technical requirements. In order to maintain compatibility with existing systems and certified abilities of our systems administrators, we need to purchase certified Oracle/Sun products consistent with our brand name requirements due to interoperability with existing infrastructure mission. In addition, this gives us the ability to purchase and maintain annual software/hardware maintenance under the same contract for all of the system equipment with one vendor thereby saving cost due to economies of scale.<br />For this requirement, only new equipment will satisfy the government's needs. No other equipment condition will be acceptable.</p>
<p>Quotations should be emailed to:</p>

Purchase of Power Injector for Computed Tomography (CT) 

Statement of Work
The CDRH has an Mx8000 Quad/IDT Computed Tomography (CT) system used in critical studies of device failures for medical devices to treat cardiovascular disease and cancer, the two leading causes of death in the United States.  These failures include, for example, fracture of coronary stents or incomplete delivery of therapies designed to treat cancer.

However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Stronger Preference:</p>
<p>Under the Technical Capability factor, stronger preference will be given:<br />Frequency Linewidth: The passive linewidth should be &lt;100kHz, with value added for more narrow linewidths. Locking electronics, which can narrow the laser to below 1 kHz using a user supplied reference cavity.</p>
<p>Stronger preference will be given to stable, low maintenance designs with good references and narrowest passive linewidths.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Past Performance, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), located on the National Naval Medical Campus (NNMC) in Bethesda, MD intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Harlan Laboratories Inc. for an estimated 2000 6-7 weeks old CD2F1 male mice with various delivery dates.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Far Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(b) Soliciting from a single source</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Harlan Laboratories Inc. is the sole source provider of this specific genetic strain (CD2F1) of male mice with the same intestinal bacteria microflora as those CD2F1 mice already in use for biomedical research. The intestinal microflora of the requested animals must be similar to that of the intestinal bacterial microflora of mice already used in the research effort. The purchase of these mice will allow for the continuation of biomedical research with this animal strain. The data derived from the use of these mice will be compared to similar and relevant data collected over 25 years. For example, responses to radiation, bacterial challenge, and treatment for radiation protection are known and are all linked to the specific genotype of the animal. Responses to the CD2F1 strain of mice, from Harlan Laboratories Inc have already been established. Continue research with CD2F1 mice will allow a strict biological and statistical comparison between the data collected with the use of these requested animals to that from previous research with CD2F1 mice from Harlan. <span>&nbsp;</span>The title of the research these mice will be used in is called, &ldquo;Preclinical development of a bridging therapy for radiation injury using tocopherol succinate in mice (Mus musculus)&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses must be electronically, via email, to <a href="mailto:stephen.enokida@usuhs.mil">stephen.enokida@usuhs.mil</a> by 4:00P.M. (EST) on July 8, 2011.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />.372.3695</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Transition Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program funded staff and to help ensure successful implementation of program funded transition activities in the field.</p>
<p>The majority of the workload of this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation. In order to help ensure successful political transitions overseas in rapidly changing environments, the Transition Specialist will ensure that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the information and training they need to start up new programs, seek out and work with appropriate beneficiaries in the field, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently. The vast majority of the workload for this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to provide a full-time Transition Specialist to the Office of Transition Initiatives.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Transition Specialist priorities are expected to change and evolve in accordance with the requirements of OTI and will be determined in consultation with and under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Chief of Field Programs Division or his or her designee.</p>
<p>Under the supervision of the DCHA/OTI Chief of Field Programs Division, the Washington-based Transition Specialist will perform the following duties:</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Program Manager is a member of one of DCHA/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, D.C. OTI currently has four regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Afghanistan and Pakistan (AF/PAK), Asia and Middle East (AME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Program Manager's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to hire qualified personnel needed to assist and support OTI's regional teams with program implementation-related activities.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the Program Manager is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Program Manager is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Program Manager is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Program Manager has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Regional Team Leader or his/her designee (e.g. the Senior Program Manager), the Program Manager will:</p>
<p>At the GS-11 level "Program Manager":</p>
<p>&bull; Respond to requests for information and tasks regarding OTI programs from within and outside the Agency in collaboration with OTI's Program Office;</p>
<p>&bull; Implement and manage assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field, being prepared to travel to difficult posts in overseas conflict or post-conflict areas for up to one month or more if required;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Thus the following has occurred:<br><br>a.	The due date for all cost proposals has been changed to 30 June 2011 at 9:00 a.m.<br>b.	The following technical question was asked:<br><br>Question:  <br><br>The main question we have revolves around what they are attaching the sytems to.  It states in the scope of work that the systems will be attached to the top of the existing gorbel crane systems (Model GLCS-FS-4000-23.5) header beams which are on 18' centers".

The crane headers need to be designed to support all the weight?<br><br>Answer:<br>The answer is that the cranes will not be used when the fall protection is in use.  The pendant controls will be locked out as part of the procedure for using the fall protection.<br><br>2.	 All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.<br> <br>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Yamaha Motorcycles was chosen because it is the only brand that makes this style.  The WR450FA mirrors the same type of motorcycle currently used and can withstand all types of terrain with little or no impacts to the performance of the motorcycle due to normal wear and tear.  
 The Yamaha WR450F has a 5 speed gear box as opposed to a 6 speed gear box offered by other manufacturers.  The Yamaha WR450F offers a carbureted system as opposed to an electronic fuel injected system (EFI).  This is less costly to maintain and repair as compared with the EFI systems.<BR><BR>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Program Manager is a member of one of DCHA/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, D.C. OTI currently has four regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Afghanistan and Pakistan (AF/PAK), Asia and Middle East (AME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Program Manager's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to hire qualified personnel needed to assist and support OTI's regional teams with program implementation-related activities.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the Program Manager is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The Program Manager is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Program Manager is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Program Manager has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Regional Team Leader or his/her designee (e.g. the Senior Program Manager), the Program Manager will:</p>
<p>At the GS-11 level "Program Manager":</p>
<p>&bull; Respond to requests for information and tasks regarding OTI programs from within and outside the Agency in collaboration with OTI's Program Office;</p>
<p>&bull; Implement and manage assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field, being prepared to travel to difficult posts in overseas conflict or post-conflict areas for up to one month or more if required;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide backstopping and troubleshooting support to field-based staff through frequent communication;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) for Task Orders with a contractor for Program Office services, ensuring OTI's requirements are met (serving as COTR requires the successful completion of a USAID training course within the first 6-12 months of employment);</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure completion of OTI project administration, budgeting and contracting action needs;</p>
<p>&bull; Manage and/or participate in the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and personal services contractors;</p>

<p>&bull; Perform complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in design and implementation of new country program operations to include management, logistical, budget, administrative, personnel and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, participate on inter-office, inter-bureau, or inter-agency committees where issues relate to OTI's program goals;</p>
<p>&bull; In limited circumstances, the incumbent may be required to provide assistance to organizations outside of OTI but within the current scope of work, where such assistance would enhance both OTI's goals and objectives as well as the incumbent's job skills;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting team leader or country or deputy country representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor/train other OTI Program Assistants / Program Managers as required; and</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs.</p>
<p>At the GS-12 level:</p>

<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Program Manager will take direction from and will report to their respective OTI Regional Team Leader within the Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<CONTACT>Leisa A. Zemba, Contract Specialist, Phone 3218540974, Email leisa.zemba@patrick.af.mil - Gregory Harris, Contracting Officer, Phone 3218530970, Email gregory.harris@patrick.af.mil
<DESC>The Patrick Air Force Base 45th Contracting Squadron is seeking sources with the capability to fill the requirement for the 45th Weather Squadron (45 WS) to update the current lightning probability tool used by the 45 WS for their daily planning forecasts. There are two main goals to be fulfilled in the update of the lightning probability tool: 1) extend the tool to include Oct, and 2) determine if stratifying the predictive equations by variable lightning sub-seasons improves performance as compared to the monthly stratifications currently being used and implement the updated tool into 45 WS operations accordingly. Extend the period the tool runs to include 1 May-31 Oct (currently the tool only runs 1 May-30 Sep). Stratify the tool by lightning sub-season, rather than by month. The dates of the lightning sub-seasons vary year to year, which must be considered in developing the updated tool. If that doesn't out-perform the current monthly stratifications, update the tool to using monthly stratifications to include Oct (May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct). Extend the study to include the most recent lightning seasons. Optimize the tool's performance on dependent data and verify its performance on independent data. Document the performance of the tool. Implement operationally on the Meteorological Information Data Display System (MIDDS) used by 45 WS. Attached documents describe the current 45 WS lightning probability tool and the MIDDS system. The following steps are the 45 WS suggested approach to the achievement of the above stated goals, though an alternate contractor approach may be considered at such time if an RFP is issued:
<p>1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Step</span>: Develop an algorithm to identify the lightning sub-season objectively. The five lightning sub-seasons are: 1) pre-season, 2) ramp-up, 3) mid-season, 4) ramp-down, and 5) post-season. There is also a sixth &lsquo;out-of-season' sub-season from 1 Jan thru 30 Apr/1 Nov thru 31 Dec; however, this sub-season doesn't apply to this task, as the tool only runs 1 May thru 31 Oct. Refer to the attached description of the current tool for the lightning sub-seasons. <br />Note: One approach for the algorithm to identify the lightning sub-seasons objectively for each year is to use the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) daily flash count across central Florida, correlate with known dates, and check if the NLDN's climatology agrees with the accepted dates. The sub-seasons must occur sequentially. Once a sub-season begins within a certain season, do not revert back to a previous sub-season, i.e. once the sub-season begins, subsequent days must either be that season, or the next season in sequence. For example, if the mid-season has begun in a certain summer, do not fall-back to the ramp-up season or pre-season.</p>
<p>2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Step</span>: Develop logistic regression equations stratified by lightning sub-season to predict the probability of lightning for each day. Select optimum predictor variables based on sub-season, repeating the process used in developing the current tool. If the new equations do not outperform the current tool, update the tool using monthly stratification to include Oct. Confer with the 45 WS on the decision of which version of the update to implement. Use all years, including new seasons, since last version of the tool was developed. Optimize the coefficients of the logistic regression on training data. Test on random independent verification data set where the data are selected randomly across all days, i.e. entire seasons are not selected randomly.</p>
<p>3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Step</span>: Document performance of the updated tool on independent data. Provide both absolute performance metrics to include probability of detection, probability of false alarm, true skill score, attribute/reliability diagram, sharpness diagrams, and briar skill score. Also document performance of the new tool relative to the current tool. Use same period of record for the comparison. This may have been done under the second goal.</p>
<p>4) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fourth Step</span>: Implement updated tool in MIDDS. Assistance from Eastern Range personnel may be required.</p>
<p>5) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fifth Step</span>: Provide training to 45 WS on how to use the tool on MIDDS and summarizing the development and performance of the new tool.</p>
<p>7) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sixth Step</span>: Provide final report documenting the development of the updated tool and its performance.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intention to set aside this requirement under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 541990. The size standard for NAICS 541990 is $7M. The Government is interested in all qualified and experienced small businesses, including 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that, in the Government's opinion, are capable of performing this requirement. In the event that no qualified and experienced small business responds, it will be the Government's intention to consider all other sources. The Government requests that interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business), and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision.</p>
<p>Sources should submit a brief capabilities statement in response to this notice. The response should be no more than 3 typed pages and must address the following areas: 1) provide a description of the firm's background in meteorology and general statistics, 2) demonstrate past performance in creating lightning probability forecast tools, preferably for the CCAFS/KSC local area 3) demonstrate experience developing and implementing software tools for MIDDS 4) demonstrate experience using statistical analysis techniques working with lightning probability tools, particularly logistic regression, to include optimum selection of predictor variables, and experience using statistical analysis software to perform those statistical techniques, and 5) demonstrate knowledge of local weather influences for the CCAFS/KSC and Central Florida. Submit capabilities statement to: Attn: Leisa Zemba, Bldg 1704, Hangar Rd, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL 32920-2200 or email to leisa.zemba@patrick.af.mil. Responses are due no later than 06 July 2010. Direct all questions to the attention of Leisa Zemba at 321 854-0974.</p>
<p>This sources sought is NOT a Request For Proposal (RFP) and does NOT commit the Government to pay for information requested, issuance of a solicitation, or award of a contract. This effort is considered Commercial in nature and any resultant RFP/Contract will be issued/awarded IAW FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>

6/27/11: Draft SOW has been revised to remove (original) Section 10, Place of Performance.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for production of FAA-designed Transmitter Sustainment and Monitoring circuit card assemblies (CCA) for the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR).  The current CCAs were developed over 20 years ago and are approaching the end of their economical usefulness with obsolescence factors inflating repair costs.  Therefore, the FAA conducted a sustainment initiative to develop a contemporary replacement to the existing CCAs using modern electronics capabilities and components.
The requirement is for a Firm-Fixed-Price type contract.  First article testing will be conducted.  It is anticipated that three (3) First Article units will be required, with a total of 150 units to be manufactured.
The Transmitter Sustainment and Monitoring CCAs will be built in accordance with the FAA's (Draft) Statement of Work (attached) and drawing package.  Interested vendors should submit a request for the drawing package, to the Contracting Officer, Connie Houpt, at Connie.M.Houpt@faa.gov by 10:00 a.m. CST, Friday, June 24, 2011.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract with a 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>06/27/2011 Amendment 11 Q&amp;A
<p>Q45. L. 1.9. states: For the Cost/Price section, include six hard copies of the section in your proposal and submit via unclassified email to mishelle.miller@dia.mil one electronic spreadsheet, preferred format as the cost worksheet, named "HHM402-11-R-0118 cost worksheet for &lt;company&gt;."<br />L. 1.12. states: Six paper copies of each proposal must be submitted. Each offeror should submit six binders: one binder containing all five sections, the other five binders containing everything except for Cost/Price (five binders of four sections). <br />Please clarify how many paper copies of the cost/price section are required?<br />A45. I regret the confusion. One paper copy of the Cost/Price section is to be included in one binder. An electronic copy of the Cost/Price section is to be submitted as well.</p>
<p>Q46. Reference Section M.1.3 (Contents of Section 2 - Technical/Management), the "Personnel" (Sub-Factor 2c) reflects SOW tasks for each resume individual. Several personnel (Sr. Engineer &amp; Contract PM; Sr. Engineer 3/SC Systems Engr; Sr. Engineer 4/SC Network Engr; and Sr. Engineer 5/SC Data Dissemination Engr) task delineations are not the same as those documented in the RFP SOW paragraph 10.4. (Personnel Qualifications). Please clarify.<br />A46. Follow the SOW tasks.</p>
<p>Q47. From Section L.1.10 on page 97 of 111 in the RFP, please clarify what documents are considered to be "Introductory Documents".<br />A47. Offeror signed copy of the SF-1449 for the RFP and an acknowledgment of all amendments (11 as of 06/27) are examples.</p>
<p>Q48. Can paragraphs marked as UNCLASSIFIED or FOUO be taken from the RFP and stored in a secure and confidential, but unclassified work space?<br />A48. For classified documents under this Solicitation within your control, you are to contact you Security Officer for guidance.</p>
<p>Q49. Is there a minimum FTE/work requirement for the prime? In other words, is the prime required to perform a certain percentage of the work? <br />A49. That depends. Be mindful of the Government's security requirements. Generally speaking, a subcontractor may meet all of the applicable security, personnel, technical, management, etc. requirements and the prime is not required to perform a certain percentage. Should the successful awardee win due to a business size standard established by the SBA, then the provisions applying to that circumstance may dictate a percentage be performed by that awardee.</p>
<p>Q50. Is the government satisfied with the performance of Integrity Applications Incorporated under HHM402-09-C-0084?<br />A50. The Government believes this question is best answered on the home page of PPIRS, referring to past performance information. "Contractors may view only their own data."</p>
<p>Q51. The SOW specifically identifies the Contract PM/Senior Engineer in Task Area 1 as key. Are any other personnel designated as key personnel?<br />A51. Only those identified as Key are characterized as such. The rest are not key.</p>
<p>Q52. The SOW shows requirements for an additional possible 23.5 FTE, the Cost/Price worksheet "additional" tab column C totals 27.5 FTE (an additional 4.0 FTE). Please clarify. <br />A52. The SOW controls.</p>
<p>Q53. The RFP states that classified storage is required up to the Secret level; however the DD254 on Page 82 of the solicitation does not authorize storage in Block 1b and in Section 11. Please clarify. <br />A53. The RFP is correct. The DD-254 is a draft and will be updated for award.</p>
<p><br />Q54. On Page 82, Section M.1.3, Bullet 2, Technical Approach (Sub-Factor 2b) Sub-bullet 4 refers to ". . .SOW task 5 requirement . . ."while SOW task 5 is for Hardware and Software Acquisition. Was this requirement meant to refer to SOW Task 4 instead? <br />A54. The SOW controls. Yes, I believe Section M should refer to SOW Task 4 instead.</p>
<p>Q55. In light of your answer to Q31 that resumes may be submitted as an appendix keeping them in the same section, we note that the Final RFP has not been changed to reflect this change. Will you please add this change in an amendment? <br />A55. The Government feels that issuing an SF-30 for each amendment, when the FBO posting states "Amendment" at the top of each entry and has been designated as such, is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Q56. L.1.7 Section 5 Cost/Price states the cost data presented will include direct costs, indirect costs, other direct costs, and profit or fee. However, the Cost/Price worksheet the government provided does not appear to allow for the buildup of costs. Will the government revise the template or should the offeror provide its own.<br />A56. Each Offeror should revise the draft Cost/Price worksheet so that it accurately reflects the individual Cost/Price proposal submitted.</p>
<p>Q57. The Cost/Price worksheet has several formula errors. <br />For example, in tab &lsquo;&lt;company&gt; HHM402-11-R-0118 core' for Option Year 1 the rate for Sr. Engineer &amp; Contract PM (SOW Task 2) (row 9) and Sr. Engineer /SC RF Engr (SOW Task 2 &amp; 4) (row 10) are referring to the same cell E4 in tab &lsquo;&lt;company&gt; HHM402-11-R-0118 misc'. <br />In tab &lsquo;&lt;company&gt; HHM402-11-R-0118 core' for Option Year 1 the rate for Sr. Engineer /SC Network Engr (SOW Task 2) (row 14) and Sr. Engineer /SC RF Engr (SOW Task 2 &amp; 4) (row 15) are referring to the same cell E8 in tab &lsquo;&lt;company&gt; HHM402-11-R-0118 misc'. <br />The formula for Sr. Engineer &amp; Contract PM (SOW Task 2) (row 9) and Sr. Engineer /SC Network Engr (SOW Task 2) (row 14) does not multiply the correct FTE hours/month and the Number of Months cells.<br />Will the government provide a revised version of the Cost/Price worksheet or should the offeror make the corrections to the formulas?<br />A57. Each Offeror should revise the draft Cost/Price worksheet so that it accurately reflects the individual Cost/Price proposal submitted.</p>
<p>Q58. Section L.10 last sentence states that you must "Start each section on its own page." While the Section 1.6 Table has a heading for "Sections" the subsections are also listed. Please clarify if by "each section" the government means major sections (i.e., 1 - Security, 2 - Technical/Management, etc.). If it means sections and subsections, please make an adjustment to the page count to accommodate the extra pages that will result.<br />A58. By sections, the Government means major sections and does not include subsections. Each major section should start on its own page; a subsection does not need to start on its own page.</p>
<p>Q59. In line with our Question 7, and your answer to Question 31 regarding the resumes being allowed to be submitted as an appendix as long as they remain with the section, we request that you clarify whether the "section" would be the major section (i.e., Section 2) or the subsection 2c - Personnel.<br />A59. I regret the confusion. Start each Appendix on its own page. In this case, subsection 2 has its own Appendix; the subsection does not need to start on a separate page but its Appendix does.</p>

<AWARDEE>Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation 9950 Wakeman Dr.  Manassas VA 20110
<DESC>Contract NNA11AB15C was awarded through DARPA BAA 11-01 which is administered byNASA. Aurora Flight Sciences will be performing an R&D effort under Technical Area 4 ofthe BAA requirement. This effort will focus primarily on the creation of a ScalableCluster Flight Algorithm. The contract award is one 6-month base period with two one-yearoptions. The goal of the System F6 program is to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits ofdisaggregated - or fractionated - space architectures, wherein the functionalitytraditionally co-resident within a single, large, monolithic satellite is  delivered by acluster of wirelessly-interconnected modules capable of sharing their resources andutilizing resources found elsewhere in the cluster. Such an architecture enhances theadaptability and survivability of space systems, while also shortening developmenttimelines and reducing the barrier-to-entry for participation in the national securityspace industry. The program is predicated on the development of open interface standards- from the physical wireless link layer, through the network protocol stack, andincluding the real-time resource sharing middleware and cluster flight logic - that canenable the emergence of a space global commons which would enhance the mutual securityposture of all participants through interdependence. A key program goal is theindustry-wide promulgation of these open interface standards for the sustainment anddevelopment of future fractionated systems.For additional information, please contact the contract specialist Marla Lefevre atmarla.p.lefevre@nasa.gov

In support of mission definition and SLA process development the vendor shall work with SC project team and VHA OI to develop an integrated roles and responsibilities matrix to establish by functional task area a clear definition of each task required, the associated input and product output, the task owner and dependencies between each task. The matrix will support defining roles among various key groups including but not limited to SC, VHA, Program Offices and OI&T. In addition to the matrix a supporting SLA engagement briefing document and draft project plan documenting required tasks to move through a SLA development lifecycle shall be generated as the companion to the roles and responsibilities matrix so that SC program office personnel can present as part of the initial engagement negotiations with various business partners to establish required expectations.

Task 2 Objective: 

SLA Development and Analysis: Provide SLA development and analysis support for VA customer care program offices for each candidate program as identified by business office within VHA. The results of a VHA data call generated several comments and proposed additional service components that need to be categorized and bundled. The vendor shall complete an analysis of the current data set and identify additional candidate enterprise and program specific SLAs. The vendor shall complete development of a required SLA in support of the VHA with guidance provided by the Service Coordination project team.  The vendor shall develop comprehensive SLAs that address all service areas supporting the business office and provide detailed service measure definitions for all services required by the system.

In order to complete development of the SLA, the contractor shall review existing data and conduct additional data collection, review and analysis required all appropriate documentation related to the program required to fill gaps.  Using this information the contractor will work with appropriate business offices to develop a draft SLA that follows the current approved format or vendor recommended changes based on service industry best practices (SC approval is required for any changes made to the SLA format).  The contractor shall use the draft SLA to collect feedback from both service provider and service recipient elements of each program and iterate reviews to achieve an agreed SLA.  The contractor shall also be required to assist in the implementation of the SLA and possible ongoing management of the SLA components post implementation. In support of the lifecycle, the vendor shall also conduct a lessons learned review at the end of each candidate programs review and assimilate the approved elements back into the SLA development process for the next implementation.

The contractor shall be required to maintain and fund their own relationships, associations, memberships, etc with industry/IT professional leader groups such as Gartner, as required to support this effort in the event that the government relationships with these groups expire. Should this occur, at no point shall government delays or inability to providing gateway access into these groups be considered a reason for non performance as it shall be the responsibility of the contractor.

Task 3 Objective: 

The contractor shall own the responsibility of ongoing recommendations over process improvements in the overarching SLA process. Contractor shall incorporate best practices and lessons learned into all aspects of the SLA process as well as support any and all ongoing reviews of the SLA process with VA management, OI&T, VHA program offices/business owners and other VA administrations/entities. In addition, it shall continuously refine the SC role in SLA creation to ensure it meets changing customer needs and expectations and scope out staffing patterns that will be required as service level management support needs decrease or increase over the life of a program.

Task 4 Objective: 

Develop SLAs. Provide coordination, analysis and engineering support to the development of both enterprise and program specific SLAs as directed by the SC director.  The contractor shall maintain enterprise and program-specific SLAs, ensure that the two domains remain consistent and complementary and work to eliminate gaps in service definition or support. In addition, the contractor shall also incorporate best practices into specific SLAs and recommend latest trends and best practices and , incorporate all identified elements into the SLA template. The contractor shall support VHA program offices/business owners as an advocate, coordinator and SLA SME through the development process. 

Multiple SLA's deliverables may be requested in parallel. SLA development shall consist of the following set of deliverables:

Task 5 Objective: 

Support the implementation of SLAs.  In this task area the contractor will address approaches to implementing SLAs, taking into consideration existing technology infrastructure and monitoring approaches (when this data can be identified and supplied, otherwise document assumptions made). The contractor shall support VHA program offices/business owners as advocate, coordinator and SLA SME through the implementation process. The contractor shall also provide expertise as required to ensure existing infrastructure supports the expected service delivery and management and recommend alternative approaches to implementation as needed to overcome infrastructure obstacles.  The contractor shall also be responsible for evaluating options within the existing infrastructure to implement service monitoring and measurement to meeting any reporting requirements as well as recommend new tools or techniques to monitoring and management.

Task 6 Objective: 

The SC team is tasked to provide additional support and conduct analysis in support of the VHA program offices and leadership team. The vendor shall provide mission related support as needed.  This may require the contractor to add resources in a timely and efficient manner as to not jeopardize the urgency of the request. The vendor shall provide to the government a proposed approach to include a synopsis of the plan, high level task identification, planned hours per task. 

Estimated Value:

The period of performance for this follow-on order is June 18, 2011 to December 17, 2011.  The estimated value is $380,184.90. 
 
(iv) Identification of the justification rationale and a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.

a.	 This procurement is issued under the authority of FAR Part 8.405-6(b)(2). The work is a follow-on to an original order that was competed and awarded in accordance with the applicable General Services Administration (GSA) Federal supply Schedule 70 (FSS 70) ordering procedures.  The original order was not previously issued under sole source procedures. This contract was competed under V776-C80102 against Contract Number GS-35F-0307M against FSS schedule.  Pricing for the Base and 2 Option Periods were evaluated during the initial award of the contract as stated by the Contracting Officer. He determined that the offer submitted by Technatomy for the base year and two option years was considered to be fair and reasonable and most advantageous to the Government.  

Contractor: Technatomy  GS-35F-0307M	
 	Base Period	Option Period 1 	Option Period 2	4-month extension	2-month extension
Period of Performance	12/18/07 -12/17/08	12/18/08 -  12/17/09	12/18/09 - 12/17/10	12/18/10 - 4/17/11	4/18/11 - 6/17/11
Price	$821,165.56	$826,000.54	$591,881.54	$253,456.60	$126,728.30
IFCAP PO#	776-C80102	776-C90017	776-C00036	776-C10034	776-C10034

b. Technatomy is uniquely qualified to perform this work within the stated period of performance.  Technatomy possesses the corporate knowledge of the environment and ability to meet the Government's requirements.  Awarding a bridge order to Technatomy should enable the Government to continue, uninterrupted, with the work well underway.  This contractor has successfully performed the requirements of the existing order to the Government's satisfaction. 

(v) A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d).

a. The contractor shall provide a price quote in response to specific tasks and deliverables required during performance of the bridge order.  The ordering activity will consider the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform the specific tasks being ordered when determining that the total price is reasonable.

b. The original requirement was competed under FSS 70 procedures. The contracting activity determined that award to Technatomy represented the best value to the Government.  The Government has determined that the current labor categories and contractor resources are meeting the Government's requirements in a competent, efficient and satisfactory manner.  There are no significant changes in the project environment that would impact performance or cost projections.

	c. Awarding a bridge order to Technatomy would also provide continuity and consistency on the project while also minimizing administrative costs.


(vi) A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.

	a. Market research was conducted as part of the initial competition process for the project. Per FAR 8.404(d) GSA has determined the rates for services offered under schedule contracts are fair and reasonable.  The only significant factor impacting a best value determination for the follow-on order is the labor mix proposed by the contractor; since the requirements are a direct continuation of the original tasks and the basic labor mix should remain consistent, additional market research is not likely to yield significant information that would alter the best value determination.

(vii) Any other facts supporting the justification.

	a. A break in service will be detrimental to VHA OHI.  This effort is of the highest priority for VHA OHI.  In response to recent realignment of IT service roles within the Department of Veterans Affairs, VHA OHI has instituted a service level agreement (SLA) management approach to ensure that business owners within the Department have the essential capabilities from the critical IT services upon which their businesses depend.  The SLA framework provides the essential elements for capturing key business needs, translating those needs into measurable services, monitoring and measuring those services, and notifying identified business and IT stakeholders in the event that these services fall below the thresholds defined in the applicable agreement(s).  The value of this framework is that it provides the business owners and IT service owners data upon which IT investment decisions can be made and adjust affected business operations to minimize impacts to the delivery of care to patients. Delay of the award of the new contract also justifies award of this follow-on. The multiple award BPA to replace the current agreement is being prepared for solicitation and has been delayed to ensure clean and thorough contract results. 

(viii) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.

	a. VHA is preparing for a new competitive BPA agreement that will result in the establishment of a long-term contract vehicle for this project area. The Government will compete the future contract vehicle among GSA Federal Supply Schedule contractors.

(ix) Contracting Officer's Certification

I certify that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Based on information provided below, request the Contracting Officer determine that only one source is reasonably available to provide the supplies and/or services described herein.<br /><br />1. Description of supplies and/or services: For its Virtual School, DoDEA requires one source for images, video clips, audio tracks, and Flash media to enhance its content-driven coursework. These digital media must be of professional quality and comply with copyright laws. <br /><br />2. Proposed contractor: iStockphoto LP, 1240 20th Ave SE, Suite 200, Calgary, Alberta T2G 1MB Canada <br /><br />3. Reason the proposed contractor is the only source reasonably available: iStockphoto is a division of Getty Images but functions independently with the benefits of having access to all Getty Images collections. Many popular photographers exclusively sell their royalty-free images only on iStockphoto. Because of that iStockphoto has more than 60% exclusive content of photography and video from popular contributors. Market research has determined that no other vendor has the capability to provide all three media (images, audio and video) and no other vendor has a collection equal to iStock's portfolio. DoDEA Virtual School web developers need access to iStockphoto's large collection of media because no other vendor has enough of all three media content to support Virtual School's constantly updated online coursework.<br /><br />4. Will these same supplies and/or services be needed again? Yes. <br />During the past six months, extensive market research has been conducted to determine the availability of digital media content providers that can meet DoDEA's requirements for royalty-free images, audio and video. This research has included internet research and contact with potential vendors. DoDEA instructional designers continually monitor new developments and access to digital media for the DoDEA Virtual School. As requirements change and new alternatives for meeting them enter the marketplace, all interested vendors will be given the opportunity to compete.<br /><br />5. Price reasonableness: iStockphoto's price list is published online making their prices fair and reasonable based published market pricing (FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(iii).<br />

Quillen VA Medical Center in Mountain Home, TN has a requirement for a construction contractor to provide construction services for a Non-Reoccurring Maintenance (NRM) project #621-11-140, CLC Cultural Changes Phase II.  The Contracting Officer is seeking approval to procure this requirement as a Sole Source to Double R construction.  The scope of work includes but is not limited to the renovation of approximately 2,000 square feet of existing space on the first and second floors of building 162.  This renovation will convert a portion of the existing space into a common space for residents and provide nurses' workstations throughout each wing.  The Design/Build contractor shall provide all technical design services, supervision, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary for a complete engineering and construction project.  NAICS code 236220 is applicable to this requirement, the size standard is $33.5M.  
This work will occur in a very sensitive area of the hospital where patients and hospital operations will continue to be on-going through the construction services.  During this time adequate air flow to the patient areas must be maintained, and a high level of infection control to maintain a satisfactory indoor air quality shall be implemented.  Work will be performed only during normal business hours and no dust shall be present in the room upon returning a patient to the respective location.  In addition, a high degree of coordination with both Nursing and Engineering services will be required to ensure the correct sequence of phasing of patient rooms occur. The uniqueness of this work will require the contractor to perform the requirements of this project, with minimal patient and hospital interruption, maintaining a high level of infection control procedures at all times.  The cost to the government will be minimized if this work can be performed by Double R construction as they are already on site working on another project, are familiar with the project work and area, has successfully performed construction services during normal hospital operations in a highly sensitive area such as Oncology at the James H. Quillen VA Medical Center.   In addition, Double R construction has successfully completed a Design-Build of a Temporary Emergency Department at the Nashville VA Medical Center where the contractor was required to coordinate all moving activities with the using service, which included the move of all functions, furniture, supplies and equipment to a temporary location prior to construction.  Furthermore, Double R construction was required to minimize disruptions to ongoing medical center operations in Nashville, TN.    Double R construction again provided Design-Build services for the Nashville VA Medical Center in project #626-09-117, where the requirements were to provide a temporary Transplant and MICU, again a high degree of coordination and experience in working in areas of a hospital where immune compromise patients are being cared for and the level of infection control procedures, must exceed that of the expectations set forth by the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Likewise, Project # 621-11-140 require that the nature of this work be performed with a high degree of infection control, project phasing, and minimal disruption of the medical center's daily operations.  
Double R construction is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business Concern registered in CCR & ORCA under the NAICS code 236220 which is applicable to this solicitation.  Double R construction has over 35 years of experience in working with VA Medical Centers and they are aware of the challenges present in completing projects where patient care is in progress.   41 U.S.C.253(c) (2) authorizes this contract action pursuant to FAR 6.302-2 "Unusual and Compelling Urgency".
Market research via CCR and the World Wide Web indicates that there are an adequate number of contractors to perform this requirement under the applicable NAICS code, yet few have the experience required for working in a hospital environment, specifically a VA Medical Center which presents some unique challenges of its own.  However, this work will require that patients be move out and back into each room on a daily basis as the work is completed in phases.  Furthermore, this project will require a high level of Infection control procedures to be in place and consistently monitored since both patients and employees will be occupying this area.  This is an unusual and compelling urgency, as typically construction areas in medical center settings are vacant during construction period services.
I hereby certify that the above justification for other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY<br>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br><br>STOCII-11-KOV-0067<br><br>1.  Contracting Activity:  Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Acquisition Center.<br><br>2.  Description Of Action:  Award of a new Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Order (DO) to Lockheed Martin Global Training and Logistics (LM GTL) under PEO STRI's Omnibus Contract II (STOC II) W900KK-09-D-0314, citing Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 Operations and Maintenance, Army (OMA) funds.<br><br>3.  Description Of Supplies/Services:  In accordance with (IAW) the Department of the Army, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G3/5/7 memorandum dated 15 February 2011 (Attachment 1), the Assistant Project Manager (APM) for Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) has an immediate fielding requirement for the CCTT configuration of the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP)v2 and the M2/3A3 to the Eighth United States Army/2nd Infantry Division (EUSA/2ID) to maintain concurrency between fielded tactical vehicles and the CCTT systems.  The total value for this effort is estimated at $1,000,000.00.  The Period of Performance (PoP) is six months after contract award (ACA).  Tentative contract award date is 06 June 2011.<br><br>To meet this immediate fielding requirement to maintain concurrency between fielded tactical vehicles and the CCTT systems, the Army must relocate 10 M1A2SEPv1 CCTT modules and 10 M2A3 Chassis Modernization Embedded Diagnostic (CMED) kits from Fort Hood, TX, to Camp Casey, Korea.  The training equipment moved from Fort Hood, TX, will be replaced with 10 M2A2 Operation Desert Storm (ODS) kits from Camp Casey, Korea, and 10 M1A1D CCTT modules from Fort Knox, KY.  The remaining 10 M1A1D modules at Camp Casey, Korea, will be placed in storage in the Continental United States (CONUS).<br><br>The required Ready For Training (RFT) date for the 10 M1A2SEPv1 modules and the 10 M2A3 CMED kits in Camp Casey, Korea, is no later than (NLT) 30 September 2011.  <br><br>Due to the aforementioned course of action, the modules and kits being relocated from Fort Hood, TX, have to be replaced by 30 November 2011 to minimize the loss of training.  With the 10 M2A2 ODS kits being relocated from Camp Casey, Korea, there still remains a disparity of 10 manned modules at Fort Hood, TX.  The Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) at Fort Knox, KY, provides the best solution to backfill Fort Hood, TX, with the needed 10 manned modules.  Because of the BRAC, the 10 M1A1D CCTT manned modules from Fort Knox, KY, along with all other CCTT manned modules and miscellaneous ancillary equipment must be relocated by 31 July 2011.  In addition to the actions discussed above, the actions below are also advantageous to the Government as they will not only meet the required disposal date of Fort Knox, KY, but will also reduce costs to the Government as LM GTL will already be on site, at Fort, Knox, KY, supporting the relocation of the 10 M1A1D CCTT manned modules. The additional actions to be performed at Fort Knox are as follows: <br><br>* Move and prepare for extended storage a CCTT Mobile Mechanized platoon set.  Destination TBD;<br>* Move one M1A1-D manned module to the CCTT Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS), Orlando FL;<br>* Move and prepare for extended storage four M1A1D manned modules. Destination is the extended storage secured for equipment originating in Camp Casey;<br>* Move and prepare for extended storage one MC/MCC/OC; and,<br>* Dispose of all video cables and networking cables left over at the site that have no further use in the CCTT at the Defense Reutilization Management Office (DRMO).<br><br>4.  Authority Cited:  IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(ii), "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."<br><br>5.  Reason For Authority Cited:<br><br>   (1) Background:  Due to the increasing threat of violence on the Korean peninsula over the past 18 months, punctuated by the sinking of a South Korean warship and the artillery shelling of a South Korean island by North Korean military forces, the decision was made to rapidly accelerate the modernization of the U.S. Army's Abrams and Bradley combat vehicle fleet on the Korean peninsula.  With the severe lack of live training areas in South Korea for combat vehicle training, EUSA/2ID has always had a great dependence on CCTT to conduct the majority of their collective training for their Abrams and Bradley combat vehicle crews.  The rapid introduction of these upgraded combat platforms now dictates an equally rapid response in upgrading the related CCTT modules so that EUSA/2ID can conduct realistic and relevant combat training.<br>   <br>On 18 October 2010, the Commanding General of the 2ID, Major General (MG) Michael Tucker, submitted an Operational Needs Statement to the Army G3 requesting the immediate fielding of the aforementioned CCTT upgrades for the M1A2SEP and M2A3CMED (Attachment 2).  The Camp Casey-Hovey CCTT complex currently has M1A1D and M2A2ODS simulators.  Upgrading the CCTT simulators with the EUSA/2ID's current tactical vehicles will enable units to train using the full capabilities of their systems in the CCTT.  Without their CCTT simulators matching their combat platforms, crews will not be able to train properly as they fight in Korea's high threat environment; potentially resulting in negative training.  The importance of conducting mission planning and rehearsals in concurrent CCTT systems directly impacts EUSA/2ID's readiness for combat.<br><br>On 18 January 2011, the Commanding General of EUSA, Lieutenant General John D. Johnson, sent a formal letter to Dr. James T. Blake, requesting his assistance in supporting their weapon system modernization, specifically as it relates to their Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) training capabilities, to include specifically endorsing MG Tucker's October 2010 request (Attachment 3).  The aforementioned CCTT upgrades are the lynchpin to ensuring relevant LVC capabilities are rapidly put in place.<br><br>On 15 February 2011, the Department of the Army, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7 approved the ONS.  <br><br>On 6 April 2011, funds were received to support this immediate fielding requirement.<br><br>   (2) Alternatives:  There are no viable alternatives that will allow the Army to meet the RFT dates required in the Army G-3/5/7 approved ONS other than contracting for this effort with LM GTL.  One alternative considered was to transfer this requirement to the Warfighter Focus (WFF) contractor to execute.  Based on historical data, it would take approximately 45 days from contract award just to disassemble the modules at the sites and even more time to install the manned modules at the new locations.  This alternative was unacceptable because the required RFT dates would not be met.  Another alternative was to find and select an 8(a) company to execute the requirement; however, this alternative would also not meet the RFT requirements.  It would take longer than September 2011 to have the requirement accepted in the 8(a) program, prepare the solicitation documents, receive and negotiate the proposal, award the contract, allow the new contractor to become familiar with the system, and obtain an export license and Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for the effort.  None of these alternatives will meet the required RFT dates and both will negatively impact the current EUSA/2ID transition training schedule and significantly slow their Operational Tempo to an unacceptable level because both alternatives would require the contractor to need additional time to perform the Fort Knox, KY effort. <br>   <br>   (3) Justification:  Only LM GTL has the capabilities and capacity to meet the RFT dates for Camp Casey, Korea, on 30 September 2011, and Fort Hood, TX on 30 November 2011.  Given that CCTT is the largest virtual simulation in the Army, with a unique hardware and software architecture developed and matured over the past 17 years, no other contractor can satisfy Army's RFT requirements for both the EUSA/2ID and Ft. Hood within the specified timeframe of RFT by 4th Quarter(Qtr) 11 and 1st Qtr 12 respectively.<br>   <br>LM GTL, and its' predecessor companies, have been the prime contractor on CCTT since the program's inception in 1992, and thus has unique technical knowledge on both the base CCTT system and the required knowledge to disassemble and assemble the modules and kits.  Over the years, LM GTL has provided a virtual simulation system designed to support unit collective and combined arms training for tactical combat vehicle crews.  Maintaining the concurrency of the fielded CCTT systems to accurately match the tactical vehicles they represent is integral in providing relevant, timely and required training for combat vehicle crews.  Thus, LM GTL is the only source that possesses the required skill set in meeting this requirement given the exceptionally compressed time schedule.<br>       <br>Award to LM GTL capitalizes on the contractor's experience on all previous CCTT M1 and M2 simulators and their ability to manage the multitude of tasks associated with disassembling, shipping, and reassembling the CCTT family of systems.  Since movement of equipment, kit installations and associated work will use existing CCTT modules, knowledge of the existing system is imperative in order to ensure a smooth transition between fielded locations, especially given the extremely compressed timeline. <br><br>LM GTL can successfully execute this requirement because they alone possess the required system technical data and knowledge needed to effectively disassemble, pack, ship, unpack, and reinstall the modules and kits to meet the user performance criteria.  Consequently, knowledge of the unique design of the CCTT modules and kits, evolved over the last 17 years, is unique to LM GTL.  Lastly, LM GTL possesses the experience of successfully moving manned module of this magnitude in past efforts.<br><br>   (4) Impact:  The impacts from an operational perspective, if this Exception to Fair Opportunity (EFO) is not approved, would result in a much later fielding to Camp Casey, Korea.  With the rising tensions on the Korean peninsula and the heightened level of training required in Camp Casey, Korea, it is critical that the RFT dates be met.  Furthermore, there will remain an extended lack of training capability at Fort Hood, TX.  Another impact is from a business perspective.  Any other contractor attempting this work would likely have to subcontract to LM GTL, resulting in the Government incurring pass through and additional costs over and above the costs of awarding directly to LM GTL.<br>   <br>6.  Efforts To Obtain Competition:  A Notice of Intent to Sole Source was posted on the PEO STRI Business Opportunities Portal (STRI-BOP) from 9-11 May 2011.  PEO STRI did not receive any responses.  Based on the rationale provided in paragraph 5, above, competition for this action is not feasible.<br><br>7.  Actions To Increase Competition:  This is a one-time requirement.  Any future, similar acquisition efforts will be competed to the maximum extent practicable. The APM CCTT, fully intends to execute all future work of this nature on the competitive CCTT Concurrency acquisition anticipated for award in March 2012. <br><br>8.  Market Research:  As discussed in paragraph 6, above, a Notice of Intent to Sole Source was posted on the PEO STRI-BOP from 9-11 May 2011.  PEO STRI did not receive any responses.  <br><br>9.  Interested Sources:  IAW FAR 5.202(a)(6), a synopsis for this action is not required since the proposed contract action will be an order placed under FAR Subpart 16.5.  However, a Notice of Intent to Sole Source was posted on the PEO STRI-BOP and, to date, no other sources have written to express an interest.  However, any proposals received will be considered.<br><br>10.  Other Facts:  <br><br>a. Procurement history.  The CCTT program was competitively awarded to IBM Federal Systems on 30 November 1992, contract number N61339-93-C-0004.  The CCTT requirements were re-competed in 2002 and competitively awarded to Lockheed Martin on 05 February 2003; contract number N61339-00-D-0707, DO 0016.<br><br>b.    Acquisition data availability.  The technical data packages, specifications and statements of work suitable for this effort and the forthcoming competitive CCTT Concurrency acquisition are currently available.  However, as discussed in paragraph 5 above, only LM GTL has the skills and experience to meet these requirements given the extremely compressed timelines. <br><br>c.   Unusual and compelling urgency.  Not applicable.<br><br>d.   Subcontracting competition.  FAR clause 52.244-5, Competition in Subcontracting, is incorporated into the basic STOC II contract to ensure that the prime contractor is obtaining as much competition as possible in its subcontracting efforts.
