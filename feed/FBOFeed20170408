<DESC>NSN 7R-1660-011204765-GF, REF NR 979796-2-1, QTY 190 EA, DELIVERY FOB ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx".

This is a Sources Sought Notice (market survey). No formal solicitation exists at this time.  This notice is for information and acquisition planning purposes ONLY and is not a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.  All qualified vendors may submit capability statements for consideration.

<p>Contract Type: Indian Health Service intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) A/E Contract in support of this requirement.</p>
<p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance: <br /></strong><br />The Period of Performance will be 18 months (460 calendar days).  Optional services are projected to extend from an additional 90 days, to potentially 1005 calendar days from the date of notice to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> In formulating the Qualifications submission, potential respondents should consider that FAR 52.219-14, which will be incorporated into any resultant contract, requires the Prime Contractor to perform services under the contract equivalent to 50% or more of the contract value in personnel costs throughout the life of the contract. This is a positive requirement rather than one where an indication of capacity, capability or willingness to meet these requirements would be acceptable. Respondent(s) should demonstrate in their Qualifications submission how they will meet this requirement. Although the specific project effort awarded under any resultant contract is not known at this time, it is believed to be unlikely a Respondent could reasonably expect to meet this FAR requirement where they propose a Prime Contractor role limited to a single discipline, or possibly even multiple disciplines, where the discipline mix proposed leans towards disciplines typically not heavily utilized in A-E Services for Health Facilities Engineering projects.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer and Important Notes All respondents must register on the SAM located At http://www.sam.gov/.</strong></p>
