<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE
<p>CONUS C-130J/LM-100J Aircrew Simulator Training</p>
<p>The Air Force Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA), 338th Specialized Contracting Squadron (SCONS)/PKB, JBSA-Randolph TX intends to negotiate a sole source non-commercial, 5 year (CY18 - CY22) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with Lockheed Martin, the only provider able to provide simulators with six degrees of freedom (Yaw, Pitch, Heave, Thrust, Roll and Sway) that are not Department of Defense or Foreign owned. This proposed contract action is pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Pursuant to FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii) all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p><br />The proposed procurement is for a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirement to provide Continental United States (CONUS) C-130J/LM-100J Aircrew Training in support of multiple foreign countries. (Note: The description herein is a summary of the required services and is not intended to be all-inclusive.)</p>
<p>Services to be performed are CONUS training services at Contractor-provided training locations, consisting of commercial off the shelf (COTS) classroom and hands-on training to provide the necessary skills to independently operate and maintain C-130J and commercial variant (LM-100J) systems, subsystems, and related support equipment. Training shall provide students a thorough understanding of their specialty requirement so they can perform all tasks identified in applicable technical data with minimal supervision. Aircrew training objectives are to train aircrew members transitioning to the C-130J and commercial variant (LM-100J) aircraft, provide initial/refresher/upgrade training to experienced aircrews, and to provide initial training to cadets. This includes ground school, flight simulator instruction and teaching students the capabilities to instruct others in this ground school and flight simulator. Contractor must have the capability to support multiple training requirements simultaneously.</p>
<p>Academic training may consist of lecture/discussion sessions and laboratory exercises. Testing procedures must be in place and documentation will be required to verify the student has gained knowledge and skills taught. Structured On-The-Job Training (SOJT) shall be conducted in the appropriate laboratory, shop or flight line environment and shall include demonstration and application of academic studies.</p>
<p>The contractor's unique qualification or nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited for the following reasons:</p>
<p>All other C-130 training is provided on simulators owned by the Department of Defense and operated by Link and Lockheed Martin for the US Air Force and Marine Corp active duty training and research. These simulators are not available to support Foreign Military Students (FMS).</p>
<p>All remaining simulators, which would fulfill this requirement, are owned by foreign countries and would not meet or be suitable for FMS customers.</p>
<p>The simulators owned and operated by Lockheed Martin are the only level "D" simulators available in the United States that are available to support this requirement.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin has developed the training courses, manuals, handouts and cockpit mock-up panels that can be individually tailored for Foreign Military Sales customers. Additionally, Lockheed Martin has held all technical data for the C-130J/LM-100J as proprietary. Therefore, another contractor would incur prohibitively significant costs to obtain proprietary rights to redevelop courses and training materials and would not be able to provide simulator capability necessary for this training effort.</p>
<p>Contact with Government personnel, other than those specified in this RFI, by potential offerors or their employees' regarding this requirement is not permitted. This is not a RFP. It is not to be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and will be provided at no cost to the Government. For purposes of this RFI, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 611512 (Flight training Schools, with a size standard of $27.5M<br />Current System for Award Management (SAM) registration is mandatory (www.sam.gov).</p>

A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.<br /><br />Title: Integrative Epidemiological Studies<br /><br />Description:<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Integrative Tumor Epidemiology Branch (ITEB) advances the understanding of cancer etiology and progression through integrative analyses of environmental and germline risk factors with comprehensive data on histological and molecular profiling of tumors and their precursors, including somatic genomic analyses. The branch also develops methods to support this cutting-edge research.<br /><br />ITEB employs molecular pathology, somatic and germline genomics, and epidemiology to identify environmental and germline risk factors for cancer. The ITEB research program includes case-control, cohort, family, and cross-sectional studies. Investigators in the branch also participate in and contribute to national and international organizations and consortia to promote research on environmental risk factors and the germline and somatic contribution to cancer etiology. They conduct studies using tissue imaging, digital pathology, automated image analysis, and molecular/genomic analyses of tissues to comprehensively characterize features of normal, precursor and tumor tissues. Branch members and their collaborators develop and use computational tools to integrate and analyze high-dimensional data to link germline and environmental exposures to molecular features of cancer and precursor lesions, including somatic genomic signatures of risk factors, particularly those with high attributable risk. <br /><br />This non R&amp;D support services contract is essential for ITEB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate quantitative exposure assessment and molecular epidemiology to provide new insights into cancer etiology, chemical carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. The National Cancer Institute NCI/ITEB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for occupational and environmental epidemiologic studies, including support for exposure assessment and molecular components, and coordination of activities related to genome-wide association studies (GWAS); and in conducting and simultaneously managing concurrent, multiple, large (including international) epidemiologic investigations of cancer etiology.<br />

<DESC><strong>Introduction</strong>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID Divisions of AIDS (DAIDS); Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT); and Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) have a joint requirement for development of the Immune Mechanisms of Protection Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis center (IMPAc-TB) program to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature, location and timing of protective immune responses required to prevent initial Mtb infection, development of stable latent infection, or transition to active TB disease.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this program is to establish an integrated multi-disciplinary team of highly collaborative investigators that will plan and conduct iterative, in-depth immunologic analyses of tissue-specific and systemic responses in small animals, non-human primates (NHPs), and humans to identify the key immune responses needed for protection against Mtb; identify immunologic targets that can be used to improve TB vaccine strategies; determine the impact of HIV/SIV and Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) infection(s) on relevant immune responses to Mtb infection or TB vaccines; and identify how bacterial immune evasion mechanisms subvert immune responses to Mtb.</p>
<p>The IMPAc-TB team will be expected to develop Standard Operating Procedures and assay harmonization methods to be implemented by the center's members; conduct in-depth immunologic analyses of tissue-specific and systemic responses against Mtb/TB in small animals, non-human primates (NHPs), and humans, including examination of host responses to BCG or novel, promising vaccine candidates (pre- and/or post-exposure candidates); collaborate with existing NIAID-supported and other TB programs; and distribute positive and negative study results, reagents and other resources within a center, between centers (if applicable), to other NIAID-supported programs, and the broader research community to facilitate the development of improved TB vaccines.</p>
<p>To achieve the IMPAc-TB program goals, Contractors will be responsible for the following activities:</p>
<p>&bull; Leadership structure: providing a Leadership Team to oversee center activities and be responsible for the planning and conduct of the IMPAc-TB center's proposed studies</p>
<p>&bull; Data and resource management system used for the storage, retrieval and analysis of center-generated data; cataloging/reporting of all center-generated reagents and research resources; and sharing of positive and negative study results and research resources within the center, to other NIAID-supported programs, and the broader research community in a timely manner through existing NIAID-supported programs (e.g., ImmPort, the Bioinformatics Resource Centers (PATRIC), BEI Resources) or other public portals or repositories designated by NIAID.</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct in-depth immunologic analyses to provide novel insights into the immune responses required to (1) protect a host from initial Mtb infection, (2) establish a latent infection, and/or (3) progress to active TB disease. These in-depth immune analyses should include a systemic analysis (i.e., not limited to a single component) of the immune system. Each IMPAc-TB team must examine at least two (2) of these three (3) Mtb/TB stages and conduct iterative immunologic studies using small animal models, non-human primate (NHP) and human studies. The immunologic studies should seek to move beyond analysis of single arms of the immune system and progress toward understanding how complex immune networks and interacting components generate a given biological outcome. The use of relevant small animal models that go beyond commonly used laboratory mouse strains is strongly encouraged. In addition, investigation of multiple clinically-relevant Mtb strains in animal challenge studies is encouraged.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one to three (1-3) cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded with performance beginning on or about August 01, 2019.</p>
<p>NIAID anticipates funding up to $19.5M for all awards (direct and indirect costs combined) resulting from this BAA. Due to the inherent unknowns in a BAA (offeror developed SOW), it is difficult to determine the exact period of performance. The Government anticipates an initial, non-severable, completion portion of work. Dependent upon offeror's technical approaches and proposed milestones, the Government may also negotiate additional non-severable, completion options.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. This BAA will be available electronically on/about February 08, 2018, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>
<p>Where proposals will be received via the NIAID electronic Contract Proposal Submission (eCPS) website add the following:</p>
<p>For this solicitation, NIAID requires proposals to be submitted electronically via the electronic Contract Proposal Submission (eCPS) website at https://ecps.niaid.nih.gov.</p>

<p>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue a sole source Firm Fixed Price Order against Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) # SPRTA1-12-G-0006 to procure four (4) GE LM2500 Single Shank Turbine (SST) Hot Section Kits, P/N 738L551G01 and four (4) full sets of GE LM2500 Paired Blade Turbine (PBT) hot section material comprising a total of two hundred sixteen (216) stage 1 blades P/N L25747G03, two hundred thirty two (232) stage 2 blades P/N L24484G18, one hundred twenty four (124) stage 1 nozzles P/N L24461G09, one hundred twenty eight (128) stage 2 nozzles P/N L21306G09, four (4) stage 1 nozzles with borescope port P/N L24461G10, four (4) stage 2 nozzles with borescope port P/N L21306G10, forty-four (44) stage 2 shrouds P/N 9082M58G05, four (4) tubes P/N 9051M36G08, twelve (12) seal assemblies P/N 9687M78G03, and twelve (12) seal assemblies P/N 9687M78G04.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The procurement shall be fulfilled by General Electric Company (GE), General Aircraft Engines Company located at 1 Neumann Way Cincinnati, OH 45215-1988.&nbsp; <br />The General Electric LM2500 is the primary propulsion gas turbine engine on the DDG-51, CG-47, FFG-7, and LCS-2 variant as well as other US Navy surface ships. There are two variants of the LM2500 gas generator: the Paired Blade Turbine (PBT) configuration, utilized on FFG-7 and CG-47 class ships, and the Single Shank Turbine (SST) configuration, utilized on DDG-51 and LCS-2 class.&nbsp; The difference between these two variants is the physical configuration of the High Pressure Turbine (HPT) blades and nozzles, also known as the hot section material.&nbsp; The SST variant utilizes HPT blades designed for increased cooling air flow, allowing the engine to operate at higher temperatures to produce greater power.&nbsp; This increased power is necessary to meet mission requirements on DDG-51 and LCS-2 class.&nbsp; LM2500 PBT and SST hot section material is not interchangeable (i.e., an LM2500 SST cannot use PBT hot section components and vice versa). The new nozzles and blades will be used on LM2500 SST and PBT gas generators that are inducted for repair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; The LM2500 gas turbine is a commercial off the shelf (COTS) item designed, developed and exclusively manufactured by GE.&nbsp; Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact GE directly.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government currently intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.&nbsp; In accordance with PGI 206.302-1, the Government is actively seeking additional sources.&nbsp; Interested persons should identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.&nbsp; This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.&nbsp; However, all responsible sources are encouraged to submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, within ten (10) after date of publication of this synopsis.&nbsp; Any submissions will not be reimbursed by the Government -- the entire cost of any submission will be at the sole expense of the source submitting the information.&nbsp; A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>Issue Date: 5 FEB 18 - Closing Date: 5 MAR 18</p>
<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division intends to issue a RFP in order to award a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00164-18-G-JQ54 on a sole source basis. The BOA is intended to be issued to L-3 Technologies - ForceX, 2208 Charlotte Avenue, Nashville, TN 37203. The RFP is for Management Software (Brimstone), Advanced Geospatial Application Media Engine, and Associated Software and L-3's MX Family of Electro-Optic (EO) Sensor Hardware Integration and Test &amp; Evaluation support. Acquisitions under the BOA will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is the lack of sufficient technical data, restricted software rights, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. No other source has the technical qualification and necessary resources to neither perform the requirement described herein, nor will any other services satisfy the Government's requirements. The estimated amount of the BOA is $600,000.</p>
<p>Request for proposal will not be made available through http://www.fbo.gov. The request for proposal will be provided to L-3 ForceX through electronic mail. The proposed noncompetitive contract action is anticipated to be awarded under FAR part 15, contracting by negotiations. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact L-3 ForceX directly. <br />The point of contact at NSWC Crane is Ms. Paula Herendeen, Code 0231 at telephone 812-854-5856 or e-mail: paula.herendeen@navy.mil. The mailing address is: Ms. Paula Herendeen, Code 0231, Bldg. 3373, NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, 300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5001.<br />Please refer to the announcement number in all correspondence and communications.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State, Office of Acquisition Management (AQM) intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for the acquisition of flatware to Lenox Corporation. The proposed purchase order is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).<br /><br />
<p>The "Embassy Scroll" pattern was chosen for its aesthetics and no other product will meet the unique style needed.  The requirement states that the desired flatware is to be compatible in all aspects (form, fit, and function) with the existing flatware currently used. This will allow the Office of Residential Design and Furnishings (RDF) to accomplish its mission objective of providing an elegant, yet graceful formal table settings that reflect American standards and products for official entertaining of foreign dignitaries.</p>
<p>The specific design features meet RDF's stringent representational standards.  Specific characteristics of the sterling silver flatware limit the availability to a sole source as Lenox is the only manufacturer of sterling flatware in the United States. Lenox owns the pattern and design currently being used by the official representational residences.</p>
<p>However, anyone wishing to have their representational flatware considered for future use may contact OBO/OPS/RDF Mary Hawkins at (703) 875-6612 to present their product.</p>

<p>Utility Records. For people who are not easily traceable via traditional sources such as credit header, locator information from utility hookup records may provide the only current and accurate address and phone number data available, and CLEAR offers the most comprehensive utility locator information on the market. CLEAR features more than 30 million utility data records (e.g., names, addresses, service information) from more than 80 national and regional electric, cable, gas, and telephone companies from Equifax. Utility records are updated daily. Utility data is particularly valuable for obtaining current addresses that may not have been found elsewhere (utility companies are often among the first to know when a consumer has moved, especially those who do not traditional report their information to credit reporting agencies.</p>
<p>Real-time Reverse Phone Number Gateway. This Gateway provides data about an individual or business associated with a phone number. There are 700-800 million assigned phone numbers in the plan, including cell phones as well as landline phones, toll-free numbers, and Voice-over Internet Protocol (VoIP) numbers. Most major phone carriers (including those for cell service are included in the source data.

<p>Transparency of Sources: In CLEAR, sources and their corresponding "reported dates" are provided with search results to provide maximum transparency to the user. The reported dates shown on records indicate the dates of the transaction or activity associated with the record at the source.

CLEAR shows the actual date of update in the source data. Additional source details, such as detailed coverage information and update frequencies, are provided in CLEAR's Online Help, so that users can be assured of the credibility, reliability, and currentness of the data.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp; Synopsis:
<p>1. NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) to determine potential sources for providing the services outlined below.<br />1.2 The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total small business set-aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541330 which has a corresponding size standard of $15M. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The Government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.<br />2.0 Background and Program Details<br />2.1 The Mini-MUTES is a ground based, Electronic Warfare training system which simulates radar emissions for use in USAF training. Mini-MUTES capability includes radiation of multiple realistic threat signals, like those encountered in an integrated air defense system. The system produces an authentic RF environment to train pilots in evasive and countermeasure tactics when threatened by surface to air missiles and anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<p>2.2 The AN/MST-T1(V) consists of a Master Control Group (MCG) and one to five Remote Emitter Units (REU). The MCG requires a single operator to set up the operating parameters of the system, including reviewing the scenario as it sequences, and monitoring the status of the unmanned REUs. The REUs can be located any distance from the MCG, requiring a communications link for remote operations.</p>
<p>2.3 Currently there are seven different REU configurations, each capable of simulating multiple threats. REU L and M are the latest configurations to be fielded and are considered to be the most advanced. Currently there are three M REUs and one L REU. <br />2.4 The REU L (Transmitter 33) and REU M (Transmitter 35) are operated daily to support Air Force Training Missions. Operational and Maintenance data is required for Government to ensure all systems are operational.</p>
<p>2.5 Currently Operational and Maintenance data for Transmitter 33 (Tx 33) is far more in-depth than the data for Transmitter 35 (Tx 35).<br />2.6 The current commercial manuals for Tx 33 (Transmitter 33 100 kW Pulsed X-Band Transmitter Operational and Maintenance Manual ETM Model 104PX Dated July 2005) and 35 (Transmitter 35 30 Kw Pulsed Ku-Band Transmitter Operation and Maintenance Manual ETM Model 303PKu Dated 22 December 2005 and Tx 35 SRU Maintenance Manual - ETM document #: 11-26365-000-A, Dated 12 June 2002) do not allow for effective level 1 (Organizational) and Level 2 (Depot) troubleshooting and maintenance.<br />2.7 Furthermore, these manuals do not contain adequate troubleshooting or repair data for the government Maintainer or Depot Facility to maintain the systems in operational status. Additionally, the schematics provided in these manuals are incomplete and difficult to understand. The Governments intent is to improve both the data and schematics contained in these manuals, and receive training on how to utilize the newly developed manuals and perform the procedures contained therein. <br />3. Specific Requirements<br />3.1 The requirements include the following:<br />3.1.1 As stated in section 2.6 of this posting, updating of the Tx 33 and 35 transmitter manuals to allow for Level 1 and Level 2 troubleshooting and maintenance;<br />3.1.2 Traveling and conducting training on the manuals at a Government-designated site for Government personnel. <br />3.1.3 Additional requirements can be found in the attached draft version of the Statement of Work. <br />3.1.4 The Government does not possess ALL the necessary data rights for this requirement. There is no GFE to base new troubleshooting, alignment, or maintenance practices on. <br />3.2 The performance objectives for both the additional documentation and training shall be to provide:<br />&bull; Documentation for Model 104PX and Model 303PKu that meets the performance objectives.<br />&bull; The documentation shall include information corresponding to Model 303PKu that is located in documentation currently provided for Model 104PX.</p>
<p>&bull; This documentation and training shall provide level 2 maintenance support.<br />&bull; An overview and explanation of the full function of the transmitter, i.e. sequence of events to generate RF. <br />&bull; Any documentation including schematics and/or block diagrams outlined in the transmitter technical order (T.O).<br />&#61607; Specifically information required for troubleshooting, and operation. <br />&#61607; Schematics and wiring/interconnection diagrams shall include enough detail to enable signal tracing from Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) to LRU and internally through LRUs.<br />&#61607; Major transmitter function (HV generators, RF sampling, filament generators, etc.).<br />&#61607; Update TO 43D7-19-4-42 to reflect any changes to the system. Create new manual that covers Model 303PKu in detail.<br />&bull; Pulse Recurrent Frequency (PRF) alignment for the pulse, as applicable.<br />&bull; Modulation Linearization alignment/adjustment, as applicable.<br />&bull; Oil-checks for the transmitter, as applicable to include information to technically recognize when oil needs to be replaced due to contamination.<br />&bull; Technically accurate and adequate description both in text and illustrations of the transmitter major components and LRUs. <br />&bull; Clearly stated fault isolation to a specific LRU rather than the current possibility list of multiple LRUs for a given fault condition.<br />&#61607; This should include fault isolation from general and system level faults, building on the overview. <br />&bull; Include troubleshooting procedures down to LRU component level, to enable field users to remove/replace faulted components and align, test for accepted operational performance specifications.<br />&bull; Three days of classroom and hands-on on-site training. <br />4.0 Industry Response</p>
<p>4.1 The Government requests interested parties provide the following information. All information submitted shall be unclassified. Information submitted containing proprietary data should have the cover page and each page containing proprietary data clearly marked as containing proprietary data. Information submitted will be retained at AFLCMC/HBZCD and will not be returned.</p>
<p>4.2 General Information<br />&bull;Company Name:<br />&bull; Address:<br />&bull; Point of Contact:<br />&bull; CAGE Code:<br />&bull; Phone Number:<br />&bull; E-mail Address:<br />&bull; Web Page Address:<br />&bull; Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (Yes/No):<br />&bull; Specify whether your company is a U.S. or foreign-owned firm:<br />&bull; Recommended North American Industry Classification System (NAICS Code) if other than 541330:</p>
<p>4.3 Please send a description of your ability to perform the effort described in this Sources Sought.</p>
<p>4.4 A description of similar work performed for the Government and for commercial customers during the past three years.</p>

<p><br />PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>In accordance with Title 10 and Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, Technology and Genomics Division (USAFSAM /FHT) is seeking to procure vendor supported reagents / kits necessary to perform oligonucleotide construction using existing Bioautomation oligonucleotide synthesis instrument, the MerMade 192X (model MERMADE 192X-26, serial number 151201, 711th equipment control number [ECN] 103802).  These reagents are required to support the GEIS-funded projects dealing with Upper Respiratory Disease (URD) and Influenza.  The project is "Rapid Primer Synthesis in Response to Novel Influenza Outbreak".  These projects support the mission at the USAFSAM/FHT and USAFSAM/PHE by providing continual evaluation, validation, and transition assistance with new off-the-shelf technologies and genomics technologies.  The evaluation of improved methods will help fill in critical gaps in troop protection, diagnostics, epidemiology and preventative medicine.  The goals of these research studies are to:</p>
<p>1)	To identify pathogens in these samples and determine failure rate of traditional testing and to provide analysis of new and/or emerging infectious disease in our military population.  (URD)<br />2)	To develop and rapidly synthesize primers for next-generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction for detection of new and emerging influenza strains for use by PHE.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>This will be a one-time purchase order where the vendor will provide the below requirements for the costs of the reagents/kits for the MerMade 192X systems:</p>
<p>1.	Government Requirements <br />a.	The vendor will provide all consumables and accessories for the MerMade 192X. <br />b.	Vendor will deliver reagents with a minimum remaining shelf life of 6 months. <br />c.	Vendor will provide a one-time delivery of all items within 30 calendar days of contract award.</p>

<p><br />ATTENTION small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort:</p>
<p>No set aside decision has been made; however, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the entire scope of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  The clause reads, in part, as follows:  "Limitations on Subcontracting (Nov 2011) ... (c) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction).  At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern... ".  Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.</p>
<p>If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used.  Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>ATTENTION all potential respondents:</p>
<p>The acquisition strategy for this program has not been finalized. If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement.  Please provide feedback on the requirement and what areas are likely candidates for SB subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part II. Capability Survey Questions</p>
<p>1.	Is your firm registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), formally known as Central Contractor Registration (CCR)? In accordance with federal regulations, all contractors doing business with the federal government must be registered in the SAM database.</p>
<p>2.	Describe briefly the capabilities of the nature of the services you provide.</p>
<p>3.	Describe your company's past experience on previous with similar services.  Include contract numbers, a brief description of the work performed, period of performance, agency/organization supported, and individual point of contact (Contracting Officer or Program Manager).</p>
<p>4.	Are there specific requirements in the documentation that we provide that would currently preclude your product/service from being a viable solution to our requirement?</p>
<p>5.	Are there established market prices for our requirement?  If you offer this product and/or service to both U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public?  Is our requirement offered to both under similar terms and conditions?  Briefly describe any differences.</p>

<SUBJECT>Tree Insecticide Treatment and Removals
<SOLNBR>12639518B0002
<RESPDATE>021518
<CONTACT>Leah H. Schultz, Contracting Officer, Phone 6123363625, Email leah.h.schultz@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>The United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) is contracting for the removal of a portion of Ailanthus altissima, also known as "tree of heaven", a known host of Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) (Lycorma delicatula), in Berks, Bucks, Carbon, Chester, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Monroe, Montgomery, Northampton, and Schuylkill Counties in Pennsylvania with the possibility of expansion into other surrounding states if new infestations are identified. A USDA and Pennsylvania Department of Agricutlure (PDA) continues to survey trees in and around the Quarantine Zone, additional infested areas are expected to be detected.
<p>Ailanthus sp., an exotic weed tree, is a preferred host for SLF, which APHIS and PDA can treat with a systemic insecticide to serve as a trap tree. To establish trap trees, the team applies insecticide to the bark of the tree, where it is absorbed and distributed throughout the tree. The SLF feeds on the treated tree and dies. PDA finds this method to be effective at controlling SLF to the extent possible given limitations on pesticide use per acre established by the EPA. The team controls non-trap trees, sprouts and shoots with herbicide treatment.</p>
<p>In 2018, the program will shift its strategy to focus on establishing key perimeter treatment and working inward to contain SLF. This strategy will include trap tree establishment, herbicide applications, and only removing trees when necessary. Trap tree establishment involves maximizing insecticide applications, which will reduce tree removals. The team will also treat a percentage of low SLF population areas in the perimeter and monitor for reductions in populations. PDA and APHIS will monitor for treatment efficacy.</p>
<p>Service will be on an as&#8208;needed basis in support of the USDA and PDA program to eradicate or control SLF in Pennsylvania or other surrounding states. Insecticide applications and tree removal activities will be completed on public and private property, in both landscaped and unmanaged areas, including woodlots and fencerows.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all personnel, labor, supervision, supplies, equipment, and materials required to remove SLF-infested and/or high risk host trees, the application of approved herbicide, Garlon or USDA approved alternative, )on stumps or saplings is required to ensure no resprouting happens. Grinding of stumps may also be required in limited instances and will be authorized by USDA upon negotiation with homeowners. The contractor shall dispose of all cut trees and woody debris, and is responsible for the restoration of properties where removal work has been completed. In very specific instances, and only when approved by USDA or land owner, can trees be felled and left.</p>
<p>Work will involve, but is not limited to, providing all personnel, labor, supervision, supplies, equipment, and materials required to treat with insecticide and/or remove SLF-infested and/or high risk host trees, the application of approved herbicide on stumps when deemed necessary by the USDA, the disposal of all removed trees and woody debris, and the restoration of properties where removal work has been completed.</p>
<p>We are looking for a contractor that has the capability to develop, manage and execute multiple treatment (insecticide) and removal (hack and squirt, herbicide application, physical removal) plans in coordination with state cooperators and federal partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government intends to award an IDIQ contract for a performance period of a base year and two options years. This contract will have a potential value of up to $7.5 millon.</p>
<p>All interested parties are invited to submit capability statements for acquisition planning purposes. The following outline is recommended (5-page limit):</p>
<p>1) Company name, address, and primary point of contact information</p>
<p>2) Recent and relevant past performance information. Include project name, description, dollar value, dates of performance, point of contact (name, title, phone, email). Indicate if the work was performed as a prime contractor or subcontractor.</p>
<p>3) Describe the personnel and crew available for performance of the proposed project.</p>
<p>4) Business Ownership and Self&#8208;Certification information (i.e. Small Business, Women&#8208;Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned, Service Disabled Veteran Owned)</p>
<p>5) Current Government Certifications (i.e. 8(a) certified, 8(a) joint venture, Small Disadvantaged Business HUBZone Certified)</p>
<p>6) DUNS number, and CAGE code</p>
<p>It is at the discretion of USDA to determine if a small business set-aside is appropriate based upon the capability information provided in response to this notice and other pertinent information gathered by the contracting officer. The appropriate NAICS code for the proposed project is 561730 with a small business size standard of $7.5 million. Respondents should ensure the information provided is detailed, current, accurate, and complete.</p>
<p>Please submit capability statements by email to Leah Schultz at leah.h.schultz@aphis.usda.gov no later than February 15, 2018 at 12:00pm CT.</p>

<p>The Government BPP is a standalone component that will be worn over the Army Combat Uniform and is designed as a blast harness with an increased area of coverage while also improving mobility and protection from blast events. The BPP contains soft armor that provides protection of the pelvic region, femoral arteries, and lower abdominal organs in a blast or fragmentation event. The BPP has four (4) primary sizes (Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), and X-Large (XL)).</p>
<p>This RFI is to gather information specific to producing the BPP. Currently the Government has a valid requirement for at least three hundred fifty thousand (350,000) BPPs over five (5) years. Specifically, this RFI seeks information on the construction of and production capabilities related to the non-ballistic carrier as well as the soft ballistic armor, which is sewn inside the carrier. The BPP shall meet the Material Systems Requirement and Ballistic Performance Requirement of the BPP Purchase Description, AR/PD 15-04 Revision C, dated March 2017 (attachment). Patterns are available but can only be viewed with ACCUMARK.</p>
<p>Submission Information: All interested vendors shall respond to the RFI by submitting the below information by 09 February 2018:</p>
<p>- Technical supporting information such as a white paper, test reports or past research and development efforts investigating material performance or a soft armor ballistic design that meets or exceeds the PD requirements.</p>
<p>- Detailed description of any past performance related to the production of tactical vests, pelvic protection, soft armor ballistic inserts, or on any United States military contracts.</p>
<p>- Rough order of magnitude (ROM) unit price</p>
<p>- Business name, address, business size and point of contact information (name, email and phone number).</p>
<p>- Business name, address, business size of all potential sub-vendors.</p>
<p>- Proprietary information should be clearly marked and will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>Interested sources should submit the requested information not later than 15 February 2018 via email ONLY to kelly.l.doolittle.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>This information should be provided to the contracting office at US Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), ATTN: Kelly Doolittle, Contract Specialist, by email at kelly.l.doolittle.civ@mail.mil. The Government does not guarantee that this RFI will result in a Request for Proposal (RFP) or contract award, and will not provide reimbursement for any costs incurred by vendors who respond to the RFI. Interested vendors will be advised if and when the Government decides to pursue a formal RFP or solicitation. Please direct all questions relating to this RFI to the contracting office, Kelly Doolittle, Contract Specialist at email kelly.l.doolittle.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought
Department of Veterans Affairs NCO1 Contracting seeks vendors who can provide services meeting the following description. It is expected that at least the Manchester NH VAMC and Providence RI VAMC will order services from a contemplated Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), although other VAMCs in New England will be able to order off the BOA as well.
Due to the requirements for on-site activities, the vendor shall be required to make physical visits to the ordering VAMCs when requested with no attendant travel cost reimbursement allowable. The vendor shall be required to make the visit within 3 days of the request.
Please respond with whether your business is capable of meeting these requirements and what size of business you are, to the POC on the front page of this Sources Sought.

Life Safety Drawing Database Management:
This RFI seeks vendors who have a software management system for Life Safety Drawings with graphical tools to store and share engineering drawings, assign space, and report usage among organizational groups, and track equipment and other physical assets. It shall be a multi-user, multi-tasking system supporting multiple users in organizations spanning many buildings and sites.

 There are three mandatory vendor tasks: 
1. Provide access to the system through the Internet. 
2. Update and maintain the drawings and the databases. 
3. Install software for use of the system provided by the vendor. 

Internet Access
The software and associated drawings and data shall be hosted on a server computer operated by vendor. VAMC users access the system through the Internet in an encrypted and protected environment. The vendor shall maintain the server and provide technical support on an on-going basis to VAMC users. 
The drawing maintenance system consists of numerous modules each with a specific purpose: 
As-Built Module: Stores and makes available as-built drawings, provides drawing mark-ups, manages revision control, and provides the life safety drawings for the Medical Center. 
Space Module: Manages and reports on detailed allocation and use of space among organizational entities. This database shall ensure that all space within the Medical Center is accounted for and allocable to the specific categories required for reporting to VHA for Capital Asset Inventory (CAI). 
Telecom Module: Manages and tracks physical layout of the Medical Center s telecommunication network, equipment, and service points. 
Administration Module: Provides for VAMC administration of the system and its modules. 
Documents Module: Organizes and stores all non-CAD drawings in a user-accessible data base with three levels of search capability: Key work search, advanced search, and query builder search. 
The ordering VAMCs will need up to 20 user accounts. 
The vendor shall maintain the system without interruption on a 24/7 basis and provide unlimited technical support. Technical support may be limited to normal operating hours. Technical support shall include telephone calls, fax messages and email. Technical support shall include on-line training, if requested.

Drawing Maintenance
Ongoing additions or renovations require changes to drawings to maintain the integrity of the drawing database. The VAMC will require that these changes be incorporated in the existing drawings so that the drawings in the system will be current. The frequency and extent of such changes will depend on completion of projects and may be unpredictable. 
Periodically, VAMC will send to the vendor drawings and other documentation that indicate the alterations in certain areas. Typically, these changes will be forwarded as AutoCAD files. The vendor shall, upon receipt of such documents, consult with VAMC staff and clarify the changes as necessary. The vendor shall incorporate the changes in the drawings and update the CAI, Space and As-Built modules. The vendor shall make the changes in drawings in a reasonable amount of time   less than ten (10) business days. 
At present, the Documents module consists of over 3,000 drawings. These are electronic files (PDF format) that have been created from manual drawings, and they are stored along with a database containing information that defines each drawing. Users can search for these drawings through queries and share them with other users. VAMC may decide to add more drawings to this library. This task shall include scanning, extracting the data from each drawing, and loading the drawings and data to the library. 
The VAMC may decide to add additional data to the existing CAD drawings. Such additional data may include life safety components, electrical panels, piping, and shut-off valves. 
The VAMC may decide to add additional buildings or suites to the system. The size and locations of these are not known now. This task shall include making field measurements and sketching out the drawings, drawing them in CAD, and loading them to the CAI system. 
Provide onsite verification of as-built conditions upon request. This shall include verification of the accuracy of existing life safety drawings in support of Electronic Statement of Conditions efforts by the Medical Center. This service shall require the additional services of a Fire Protection Engineer (FPE). If one is not on the vendor s staff, these services shall be contracted by the vendor. The VAMC shall approve the proposed consultant for these services. The FPE retained to provide these services shall be licensed to practice in the States where the VAMCs are located.

Software Installation
Software for use of the provided storage system shall be available to the VAMC for download and installation on individual workstations for end users. This software shall be fully licensed for use by the end users at no additional cost to the VA.
Provide training for end users at least twice a year on-site, demonstrating the use of the online system. This training should focus on the system Modules in use by the VAMC. The training should last approximately 2 hours for each session, followed by an additional two hours of specialized training for the users that are assigned as administrators.

Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /> <br />This notice is issued to help determine the availability and type of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting this potential government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method including small business socio-economic set-aside possibilities and to determine the availability of qualified Small Business companies technically capable of meeting the Government's potential requirement.  All Small Business companies with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is  811219-Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance with associated small business size standard of $20.5 million.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was officially established in fiscal year 2012 to transform the translational science process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster. NCATS, one of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) at NIH, strives to develop innovations to reduce, remove or bypass costly and time-consuming bottlenecks in the translational research pipeline in an effort to speed the delivery of new drugs, diagnostics and medical devices to patients.</p>
<p>The NCATS Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) is tasked with identifying and developing novel small molecule leads against a wide spectrum of human disease targets, which it accomplishes by screening thousands of small molecules in collaboration with both intra-and extramural researchers. In pursuit of this goal, the Center has a strong internal transdisciplinary team of scientists who continually discover novel small molecules and develop novel disease models for application against a wide range of human diseases.</p>
<p>The NCGC has several instruments that are used on a daily basis and require yearly preventative maintenance (PM) checkups as well as service coverage in case of instrument failure including several such instruments manufactured by GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences. The IN Cell 2200 systems are automated high content imagers that are used on a daily basis. One of the systems is on the Kalypsys robot and can be used on a 24/7 basis. The AKTA system is used routinely by the NCATS Assay Development and Screening Technology (ADST) group and requires an annual PM for optimal performance (e.g. upgrades, alignments, etc) and any failure would require immediate professional assistance by an OEM certified technician.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br />The purpose of this potential requirement is to obtain annual maintenance service and fullcare coverage on the subject equipment manufactured by and previously purchased from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences from an authorized GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences service provider by OEM-certified technicians. Specifically the subject equipment includes two (2) INCA2200 IMAGING SYSTEMS, S/N's 29027886-MK03131 and 29027886-MK03125, and one (1) AKTA Pure 25 M1 system, S/N 29018227-1945563. The NCGC operates the subject equipment at 9800 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850 and has provided high quality optimization of measures in many labs across NCGC.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. The purpose of this notice is to obtain capabilities information from all size and types of firms to determine the degree of competition. Information received will be used to make a determination regarding the use of full and open competition or to set aside the procurement. We are considering setting aside this acquisition in which case the Non-Manufacturer's Rule would be applicable, see 13 CFR 121.406. If responses from capable small businesses are not received, then if a solicitation is released the requirement will not be set aside. If the NAICS code of 331511 Iron Foundries is not sufficient for your business, please recommend another NAICS code. No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.<br /><br />The anticipated contract will be a firm-fixed price indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract for supplies, with one base year and four one year ordering periods. The estimated minimum order per year will be five (5) anchors and the maximum will be fifteen (15) anchors per year. The amount of all orders would not exceed 75 anchors over the life of the contract. <br /><br />This sources sought notice is for the manufacture of cast iron anchor weights that meet the specifications needed by the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL). PMEL deploys hundreds of underwater instruments every year. The instruments are attached to a mooring line, which is anchored to the sea floor with an anchor. The mooring line is attached to the anchor via an acoustic transponder/release. When it is time to recover the mooring, the acoustic release detaches from the anchor. The mooring's flotation brings the mooring line and the instruments to the surface where they are recovered by the ship. The Contractor shall provide anchors, which comply with the following specifications:
<p>Anchor weights:<br />The vendor shall fabricate cast iron anchor weights of at least two (2) sized weights (3000# and 4400#) to PMEL supplied drawings and specifications. These weights will be shipped to different PMEL colleagues in Seattle (PMEL), France, India, Brazil, Indonesia or other foreign contacts by the vendor, depending on project requirements at time of ordering. Specific addresses for delivery will be supplied at time of each order. Additional weight requirements of anchors and additional partnerships may arise during the period of performance and vendor shall be able to facilitate the fabrication and delivery of these additional cast anchor weights when/if the need arises. Specifications are attached.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit: 1) A brief description of their capability to provide the required anchor weights.; 2) Evidence of experience and past performance in the past five years (including a contact name and telephone number) ; 3) Intention to submit a proposal as a prime contractor; and 4) Business company size, point of contact and DUNS number. The business size shall include any applicable preference program (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Small Business, etc.) For the purposes of this requirement, the NAICS size standard for small business is 1,000 employees or less.</p>
<p>Questions concerning this notice shall be emailed to erik.lundstrom@noaa.gov. Responses shall be submitted via email or facsimile at 206-526-6025 by 3:00PM, Pacific Time, February 13, 2018. This notice is for informational and market research purposes only. Failure to submit all information requested may result in an unrestricted acquisition.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources.
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUB Zone firms; Veteran and Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses, Women-owned Small Businesses and Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) to develop the statistical sampling methodology used to perform post claim reviews by selecting the sample cases, and to extrapolate the sample results to the populations to determine the dollar amount of claims paid which were not documented to FHA standards. The NAICS Code(s) are: 541211--Offices of Certified Public Accountants, business and 541219 --Other Accounting Services, and the Small Business Standard is $20.5 Million based on NAICS code 541211 and $20.5 Million based on NAICS code 541219, PSC Code R704 -Auditing Services, for Statistical Sampling and Extrapolation for Single Family Post Claim Review.<br /><br />The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides mortgage insurance protection to HUD-approved lending institutions (mortgagees). Under the terms of the contract of insurance between HUD and the mortgagee, the mortgagee may act to terminate the agreement upon the mortgagor's default of the mortgage loan contract. When all requirements of the National Housing Act, Code of Federal Regulations, and applicable instructions (Mortgagee Letters, Handbooks, Single Family Claims instructions, etc.) required by the contract of insurance have been performed, the mortgagee is entitled to receive single family mortgage insurance benefits from HUD. These insurance benefits are obtained by the mortgagee's submission of a claim application, Single Family Application for Insurance Benefits, Form HUD-27011, to the Departments Single Family Claims Branch. The SFPID requires support to select the audit sample using the commonly accepted sampling methodology, and extrapolate the sample results to calculate to the population of claims paid to determine the dollar number of claims paid which were not documented to FHAs standards. Develop and make available and maintain a statistically valid and generally accepted sampling methodology appropriate to its purpose and coded securely into Excel for efficient use by non-statisticians in a user-friendly manner. The purpose of the sampling methodology is to perform substantive audit tests of populations of claims paid by selected loan servicers and to extrapolate the sample results to the populations to determine the dollar number of claims paid which were not documented to FHA standards, and ultimately protect the FHA Insurance Fund. In addition, create, update and improve the data collection and reporting tool that holds the historical claim data and review findings to generate the risk level management reports. Perform trend analysis and risk analysis to assist the SFPID regarding current or proposed payment threshold Single Family Claims Payment System (A43C).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />HUD pays claims based on the Form HUD-27011 submitted by mortgagees and the certification that the claims are true and correct. The instructions for preparing and submitting the Form HUD-27011 are included in Handbook 4330.4 REV-1, FHA Single Family Insurance Claims, and subsequent updates via Mortgagee Letters. Additional claim guidance can be found in Handbook 4000.1. Mortgagees are required to maintain a review file with complete records to support all claim submissions as noted in 24 CFR. The automated claims system, A43-C, is used by HUD to ensure that a claim submission passes the established control parameters and edits before generating a payment to the mortgagee. This process depends largely upon the accuracy and reliability of data submitted by FHA-approved mortgagees. <br /><br />In FY 2017, approximately 372, 267 claim transactions were paid, totaling over $17.5 billion. Most claims are processed and paid through A43-C without further intervention. However, if the claim does not pass the established control edits, the system will suspend the claim without generating a payment until the mortgagee corrects the claim data or provides supporting documentation. Certain mortgagee and/or data entry errors that the system cannot readily identify could result in incorrect claim payments. Since HUD pays claims automatically based on the mortgagee's certification, HUD reserves the right to perform post claim reviews on all claim files to ensure mortgagee integrity and accuracy, and to protect itself against over claimed amounts disbursed from the FHA Insurance Fund.</p>
<p>Special Qualifications<br />The tasks identified in this action require a high level of knowledge and expertise with statistical analysis, sample design, risk management, and litigation analytics.</p>
<p>Senior Economist/Subject Matter Expert (SME)</p>
<p>The SME must have an advanced degree in Economics and at a minimum of 5 years of experience in statistical sampling, extrapolation, risk assessment, and litigation analytics.</p>
<p>Project Manager (PM)</p>
<p>The PM must have a degree in Economics and at a minimum of 5 years of experience in statistical sampling, extrapolation, risk assessment, and litigation analytics. The PM shall be responsible for contract management, ensuring problem resolution, and client satisfaction.</p>
<p>Specific Tasks</p>
<p>Statistical Sampling and Extrapolation adopt a commonly accepted statistical audit sampling methodology to perform substantive tests on the population of single family claims paid in the prior 3 years by selected servicers. The audit sampling methodology will estimate the proportion of claims which are not adequately documented to FHAs standards.</p>
<p>The sampling methodology shall: (1) comply with all applicable regulations, Mortgagee Letters and other authoritative standards as may exist from time to time; (2) be well documented; (3) enable users to set sample design parameters at either 95% or 90% for reliability and 5% or 10% for precision; (4) select from each population a valid sample of claims to be tested; and (5) extrapolate sample results to the population of claims paid to determine the dollar amount of claims paid which were not documented to FHAs standards. Record and preserve all sample selections and extrapolation results on media acceptable to FHA.<br /><br />Demonstrate the proposed statistical sampling methodology to be used along with its reliability and precision. It is prudent that the calculation is beyond reproach before HUD employs it. The calculation must be retested on a regular basis to maintain the public trust. HUD reserves the right to verify any or all extrapolations. The Contractor shall assist HUD by providing explanation of the sampling methodology or extrapolation to the servicers upon request on an on-going basis within the scope: 1) provide technical support by making recommendations for modifications to the current sampling methodology because of policy changes to the Single-Family Mortgage Insurance Program; and 2) assist HUD by providing information relating to questioned procedures regarding statistical sampling or extrapolation (e.g., administrative reviews, congressional inquiries, litigation, etc.). Perform the statistical sampling selection and extrapolation of sample results for post claim reviews for approximately 20 servicers annually. The actual number of servicers/reviews to be performed will be contingent on the number of claims filed and the number of appeals submitted by mortgagees. HUD cannot predict which companies will file claims, how many claims will be filed, or how many appeals will be submitted during any given period.</p>
<p><br />Statistical Sampling</p>
<p>Perform the statistical sampling selection for selected servicers provided by HUD. Provide the mortgagee audit report for each selected servicer to the Contractor prior to conducting the review. Provide the sample selection within 5 business days from receipt of such document. <br /><br />The sample selection is required for initial review only. The exceptions will be lenders where the findings amounts are above the maximum threshold HUD considers acceptable. In the case of exceptions, HUD reserves the right to require an expanded review by reviewing an expanded list of cases statistically selected for review. Recommend expansion of a post claim review if the analysis of the claims in the original sample shows that the findings of overclaimed amounts and compliance discrepancies exceeds HUDs threshold for tolerance or specified precision level based on average dollar amount per case or the frequency of review findings. The recommendation must include the additional samples that need to be reviewed to meet the acceptable precision level.</p>
<p>Extrapolation of Sample Results</p>
<p>Perform the extrapolation of sample results to the population of claims paid to determine the dollar number of claims paid which were not documented to FHAs standards for each selected servicer. The Cornwall provide the sample results to the Contractor for each review report. The Contractor shall provide the result of extrapolation within 5 business days from receipt of such documents. Most reviews consist of three reports: an initial review report, a follow-up review report, and a final review report. The expanded reviews consist of five reports: a preliminary report, an initial report, two follow-up reports and a final report.<br />Data Collection and Reporting ToolCreate, update and improve the data collection and reporting tool that generates audit worksheets, creates audit reports, retains all audit findings, and generates management reports, such as trend and risk analysis reports. The reports should be generated without additional user inputs.</p>
<p><br />Trend Analysis and Risk Analysis<br />At a minimum, the following information shall be provided in the management reports.<br /><br />o Top 5 highest audit findings by dollar amount<br />o Top 5 highest audit findings by frequency / occurrence <br />o Average recovery rate by sample level and universe level<br />o High risk servicers that exceed average recovery rate<br />o Average dollar of audit finding error per case<br />o Comparison of mortgagee performance against average dollar<br />o Mortgagee performance progress from previous reviews<br />o Mortgagee performance progress from previous reports<br />o Improper payment detection through predictive review results <br />o Recommendations on risk assessment and management</p>
<p>Provide the recommendations, as appropriate, regarding current or proposed payment threshold for Single Family Claims Payment System (A43C) based on the recurring audit findings or high suspended edits on specific expenses prior to the claim payments. Provide a trend analysis of different type of expenses such as Items 110, 111, 112, 113 and 130 of Part B, Form HUD-27011 annually.</p>
<p>Court Appeals</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice and is for informational purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS, OR BIDS. Per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responses do not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation. The Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this notice. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this notice. This notice is a market survey being conducted solely to determine whether there are adequate Small Business contractors for the following proposed procurement.<br /><br />The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Region 3, has identified a need for a Multiple Award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract vehicle for the provision of repair and alteration construction services to government owned and leased facilities in the states of West Virginia (except for Ohio County) and the western half of Virginia (including the counties of Alleghany, Bland, Botetourt, Carroll, Craig, Dickenson, Floyd, Franklin, Giles, Grayson, Henry, Lee, Patrick, Pulaski, Roanoke, Russell, Scott, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington, Wise, and Wythe, and the independent cities in Virginia of Bristol, Covington, Galax, Martinsville, Norton, Radford, Roanoke, and Salem). The award of multiple ID/IQ contracts is anticipated. Ordering officials will solicit and award task orders for specific projects on a competitive basis amongst the ID/IQ awardees in accordance with FAR 16.505. The estimated values of all projects/task orders will range from the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000.00) up to the prospectus limit (currently $3.095 million).<br /><br />The term of the ID/IQ contracts will be a one (1) year base with four (4) one-year options. The contracts will not include pre-negotiated line item pricing. Each project/task order will be competed among the ID/IQ contract awardees using criteria established by the ordering office (price alone or a combination of price and technical factors). This contract vehicle may be utilized by both Regional and Field Office personnel. No fewer than three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts are anticipated to be awarded as a result of this procurement. However, the Government reserves the right to award a number of contracts outside of this anticipated range.
<p>The scope of this proposed procurement includes the provision of the following services:</p>
<p>1) construction services, including, but not limited to: general office renovation; interior construction; exterior construction repair; general repair and alteration work; installation of new and the alteration of existing power panels; carpet and carpet tile replacement; painting; HVAC duct work modification; modification of existing building fire sprinkler systems; plastering and plaster repair work; sidewalk repairs/replacement; asphalt/concrete paving;</p>
<p>2) alteration services, including, but not limited to: electrical, carpentry, masonry, plumbing, mechanical, architectural, landscaping, storm drainage, exterior restoration, waterproofing, re-pointing, cleaning, sealing, design-build services; roofing involving installation, repair and alteration, and removal; and paving relevant to property and roads owned, leased or otherwise under the control of GSA, or other authorized Federal agencies; and other related work. Additionally, design work incidental to construction as well as design/build work are included.</p>
<p>This proposed procurement is anticipated to be set aside for small businesses under FAR 19.502-2. ID/IQ contracts will be awarded to responsible offerors whose proposals offer the best overall value to the Government. Individual projects/task orders will range in value from the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000.00) up to the prospectus limit (currently $3.095 million). Projects/task orders outside of this dollar range may also be competed among the ID/IQ awardees, if it is in the best interest of the government to do so. However, awardees have the option to decline any project/task order award in such case.</p>
<p>The NAICS code applicable to this proposed procurement is 236220 and the size standard is $36.5 million.</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION OR BID.</span></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.</span></strong>
<p>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District is seeking information regarding capability and availability of potential small business contractors to perform work that involves a construction contract for decommissioning equalizing valves. Divers will be required to cap the inlet. The screened water intake will be blocked. The existing valves will be removed and the piping will be filled with grout. Capping and filling with grout prevents any part of the deteriorated piping system from falling into the intake and damaging a unit.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Garrison intake equalizing valves are required to recover from emergency or urgent situations where an intake gate is failed or broken. They equalize the head between the upstream and downstream sides of the bulkheads so they can be raised. The condition of the existing valves and piping demands attention to maintain a viable repair system. Given situations where use of the bulkhead is required, failure of the equalizing system will prevent removal of the bulkhead gate and extend unit outages until a work around can be implemented.</p>
<p>The equalizing valves have remained under water under normal conditions since their installation in 1955. The existing valves are over 60 years old, and have exceeded their expected life and their operation is unreliable. The valves and piping are severely corroded and several of the valves are no longer operable. Replacement parts for the valves are not available and it is doubtful that the valve bodies are in adequate condition to allow repair.</p>
<p>The bulkheads and equalizing valves will be replaced in a separate contract. Then the existing equalizing valves will be decommissioned.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Omaha District is seeking qualified Small Business (SB) Community Members [Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Section 8(a), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Women Owned Small Business (WOSB), HUBZone Small Business, Small Business (SB) led teams, Small Business Partnerships and or Small Business Joint Ventures] and Other Than Small Business (OTSB) concerns that qualify under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 237990 - Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. The Small Business Size Standard is $36.5M. Construction magnitude for this project is estimated to be between $100,000 and $250,000. This Sources Sought Notice is part of the market research activities and your responses are sought to identify potential sources that have the knowledge, skill, equipment, experience and past performance necessary to perform the aforementioned construction services.</p>
<p>All interested, responsive and responsible contractors are encouraged to participate in this market research by submitting a response via e-mail to monica.l.dwyer@usace.army.mil no later than <strong>2:00 PM CST 8 Feb 2018.</strong> Responses should include the <strong>company name, address, contact name and title, phone number, e-mail address, business size and classification/certification under NAICS Code 237990, CAGE Code, DUNS Number, your bonding capacity (single and aggregate) and a list of your company's three (3) most recent projects of the same type described in this notice. Recent project information should include project number with title/description, name of the government agency or non-government client for which the work was performed, the agency/client point of contact (name, phone number and e-mail address) and whether you participated as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor.</strong> This notice does not constitute a request for a formal proposal. This notice is provided as information to the market place and is an invitation for an expression of interest and brief demonstration of qualifications to perform and deliver the anticipated requirement. The Government will not pay for the provision of any information, nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information. Contact Monica L.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for<br />Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC)<br />Quantitative Software Design Analysis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>This announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) by the United States Air Force, Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), and Program Executive Office for Battle Management, Hanscom AFB, MA. This NOCA shall not be considered by your organization as an invitation to bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Issuance of this NOCA does not restrict the Government regarding acquisition approach.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a sole source contract to SilverThread, Inc. to continue experimentation with Quantitative Software Design Analysis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The period of performance will be thirty-six (36) months. The award is a precursor to implementing a set of software engineering and security measurement tools in a Cloud environment, of which SilverThread might be one of several Software Engineering-related tools.</p>
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>The Air Force intends to continue experiments with Quantitative Software Design Analysis (QSDA) using a tool called SilverThread. This is the second step in PEO Battle Management's plan to deploy 4-7 software engineering and security tools over the next 36 months in a commercial cloud Build and Test environment and to make the set of complementary tools available to all Air Force programs on a demand basis. Subsequent planned tools will include code quality, which we view as different from design quality, automatic Function Point counting, security scanning, and a variety of other targeted niche capabilities under the guise of Software Engineering. Individual programs will pay for their tool usage on a "scan basis" rather than the Air Force entering into a long term enterprise license for each of the tools. This period of performance will enable the Air Force to fully understand and verify how to use the QSDA technology in a variety of domains, plan a measurement program, verify how QSDA can help the Air Force accept a Design, consider a legacy capability and whether it architecturally can be refactored or must be rebuilt, verify the additional COTS tools needed by the Air Force, and experiment with their deployment, integration, and effective use by organic and contractor developers and testers.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong><br />The key features we expect from a tool to complete a QSDA are described below. These features must be met for an equal item to be considered.</p>
<p>1. The capability shall provide Quantitative Software Design Analysis of software systems, subsystems and system-of-systems and statistically-relate design features to cost and schedule outcomes. It shall develop multi-dimensional statistical models using at least complexity, cyclicality, and modularity. It shall relate these components in terms of future agility, maintainability, cost-defect risk, team productivity, waste, and support decisions to refactor versus rebuild from scratch. The models shall be underpinned by the data from hundreds of existing, comparably sized commercial software projects encompassing at a minimum these languages: C, C++, Java, C#, Fortran, Python, and JavaScript. Further, the model(s) should be expandable to encompass the Air Force's growing volume of QSDA-based data. Further, analyses and models shall be capable of instantaneous sub-stratifications by Language, program type, domain, and size as well as evolving to encompass new data and Languages. The results of these analyses shall produce recommendations for rewriting, refactoring, or doing nothing based on a financial rate of return, and then provide ROI and IRR ranges with confidence intervals.</p>
<p>2. The tool shall disaggregate software design of complex systems and quantitatively relate macro- and micro-architectural perspectives to historical experiences in Software Productivity (days to 1000 lines of production) and Waste (percentage of new development added to an existing software capability that will go to Waste because of its existing design). The Air Force intends to marry this capability to features from other COTS software metrics tools to enable "go" or "no go" decisions based on the anticipated "Waste" associated with an investment.</p>
<p>3. The tool shall capture build-time dependencies, capture runtime dependencies during the test phase, and via static analysis to capture code-level dependencies.</p>
<p>4. The tool shall create intuitive visualizations of software design quality, software architecture, and be capable of integrating in dashboard development activity, defect density, and other combinations of software design structure and software economics data from other COTS tools the Air Force will subsequently acquire.</p>
<p>5. The tool shall capture information about Intellectual Property within a codebase, including the location of code developed and owned by different contractors, and code subject to different open source licenses. These features shall be underpinned with a variety of visualizations to easily understand product ownership.</p>
<p>6. The tool shall easily integrate data from multiple other software engineering measurement and security tools for visualization and dashboarding.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Contracting and General Services in Falls Church, VA intends to award to the National Association of Conservation Law Enforcement Chiefs, 5000 West Carefree Highway, Pheonix, AZ 85085 for instructors, participants, peer coaches, instructional planning services and presentation venues for two iterations of International Conservation Chiefs Academy (ICCA) beginning March 11-23, 2018 and September 16-28, 2018 and two per year for the duration of one option year. This training shall support the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement (OLE) by providing training for peer coaches and instructors specifically for Adaptive Leadership and other curriculum related within the ICCA two week course of training.  The National Association of Conservation Law Enforcement Chiefs (NACLEC) is the sole source of this instrument and the program is the only one of its kind.  The ICCA was based on the NACLEC Academy profile and the NACLEC Academy has been a joint venture with the Service and NACLEC since 2014.  NACLEC is unique from other law enforcement executive leadership providers in that its focus is executive leadership development in the specific context of conservation law enforcement.  The copyrights, academic, and intellectual concepts were maintained, and are offered by NACLEC.  The NACLEC customized participant materials and instructions are essential elements of the ICCA training program and would create an insurmountable void if they are not available for instruction in these programs.

This requirement is for one base year plus one option year.

The proposed contract is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  

All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability for this requirement by responding to this announcement. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Notice of Intent - Sole Source For Continued Fire Shelter Material Testing
<p>The USDA Forest Service, National Technology and Development Program in Missoula, Montana, intends to award a sole source commercial contract to MYAC Consulting. The requirement is to provide continued fire shelter material testing: test protocols for testing new materials for potential improvement to the current Forest Service M-2002 (New Generation) fire shelter that requires specifically adapted test apparatuses. The test protocols are extensive and range from a small scale gas capture and analysis and material strength tests to full-scale radiant and convective tests to name a few. The contract will be a single award, firm-fixed price contract for one year. This sole source action is being accomplished in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.3. The North America Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541380 and the size standard is $15 million. The Government believes that MYAC Consulting is the only known source that can satisfy the requirement for continued testing. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.2. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing solicitation #12-0343-18-Q-0036; however, they must provide supporting evidence they can provide the continued testing without duplication of costs to the Government or unacceptable delays. All responses will be fully considered. If no affirmative responses are received by February 8, 2018 at 4:00 p.m. local time to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with MYAC Consulting for the requirements stated here. Any information received will only be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. Submit any information, questions, or comments to Jeanne Windle at njwindle@fs.fed.us.</p>

<p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Fluidigm Corporation of South San Francisco, CA to assist the National Marine Fisheries Service by providing Fluidigm 96.96 Dynamic Array plates for collecting genotyping data.</p>
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Northwest Regional National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) requirement for Fluidigm 96.96 Dynamic Array plates.  Fluidigm is the original equipment manufacturer of the EP1 genotyping instruments and is the only manufacturer of the specific Dynamic Arrays, which are the only supplies that are compatible with our existing equipment.  Additionally, the Fluidigm equipment that we use is the same equipment used by all the other laboratories that we share data with.  Using any other equipment would cause the data to be irreconcilable with other data from the other entities.  The period of performance is from the date of award through March 31, 2018, with an option period for more dynamic arrays through March 31, 2019.  The option period may or may not be exercised at the government's discretion.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<CONTACT>Robb, John
<DESC>Sources are being sought for contractors that may be interested in submitting proposals for the Region 2 Superfund Technical Assessment & Response Team (START) V contract.  A formal RFP will be issued at a later date.
The contractor shall provide the Removal Support Team services in Region 2s Service Area; New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The contract type shall be a Fixed-Price with Economic Price Adjustment and includes Fixed Rate Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) elements for specialized labor as well as a cost reimbursable portion for Other Direct Costs (ODCs).  This procurement will be a follow-on to an existing requirement.  The Emergency Remedial Response Division (ERRD) has a continuing need to obtain the services of a fully trained, highly specialized environmental contractor to provide technical support services to EPA for emergency responses and technical support activities, as defined by the contract Performance Work Statement (PWS). These services will be in conformance with the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (40 CFR300); Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990; Section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986; other Applicable Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARARs); and Federal, state and local statutes and regulations.  This action requires a core team that provides advisory and assistance services to the ERRD Removal Program as well as to other programs such as remedial support activities.  The requirement demands experienced trained and accredited personnel with current credentials/certifications in sufficient number to fulfill emergency responses within the region, cross regional responses, national responses and trans-boundary international responses.

<SUBJECT>MOE Software License Renewal
<SOLNBR>68HE0D18Q0025
<ARCHDATE>02022018
<CONTACT>Day, Harold
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Research Triangle Park (RTP) in Durham, North Carolina intends to negotiate a sole source basis to Chemical Computing Group, Inc. in accordance with 13.106-1(b)(i) soliciting from a single source to purchase the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software license renewal.  This procurement is recommended to be processed without full and open competition.

EPAs National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) is needing the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software license renewal.  The software provides a rapid means for developing quantitative structure activity relationship models.  It offers predictions for over 200 two-dimensional (2D) and over 100 three-dimensional (3D) molecular descriptors, yielding predictions for over 350 descriptors in total.  The conformational search feature within the MOE software allows for rapid screening of 3D structures of small molecules, which is necessary for the high-throughput analysis of chemicals tested in in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies.  Options for quantum mechanics (QM) calculations are also available.  The program has multiple ligand docking options, including induced fit and rigid receptor models.  The protein sequence and structure alignment tools, as well as homology modeling can offer insight into the targets for multiple adverse outcome pathways (AOPs).  The graphic-user interface is easily navigable and allows for quick location of desired functions, processes, and windows. 

 This combination of cheminformatics and computational chemistry tools offered in MOE make the program a unique, important investment for the HEDMB.  As described above, having continued access to the MOE software is critical to HEDMB science research and product development considering existing commitments and is planned/expected to contribute greatly to guiding our future research projects, such as identifying toxicophores necessary for binding of chemicals to receptors of interest (e.g., estrogen and androgen receptors).
This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals. This notice of intent is for information purposes only; therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. 

All capability statements received within 5 days after publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide the services outlined and itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Submit capability statements via email (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Contract Specialist, Harold Day, at Day.Harold@epa.gov. 

No telephone calls will be accepted.

The NAICS code for this procurement is: 541511  Custom Computer Programming Services

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>Background<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), workload for drugs regulated under the Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug Review process (monograph) has significantly increased since the passage of the Sunscreen Innovation Act (SIA).  OTC drugs are medicines sold directly to a consumer without a prescription. OTC drugs now account for about 60 percent of all medications used in the United States. The OTC monographs represent regulatory standards for the marketing of non-prescription drug products not covered by new drug applications. Those standards need to be continually updated to add, change, or remove ingredients or other pertinent information.</p>
<p>To set forth procedures of reciprocal cooperation to assist each participating organization in meeting its responsibilities for the efficient and effective establishment of the monograph components, an agreement was executed between two FDA institutions - the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR).</p>
<p>The Monographs Unit within NCTR's Office of Research is responsible for the systematic literature review for safety and effectiveness of OTC monographs active ingredients as requested by CDER. Since NCTR is a nonclinical organization, the Monographs Unit periodically require consultations on the accurate interpretation of clinical safety and efficacy information.</p>
<p>Statement of Need<br />The FDA/NCTR Office of Research Monographs Unit requires drug information expertise in developing and ensuring the use of appropriate scopes and formats for white papers and/or monographs.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE</p>
<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employee referred to IHS through this contract.</p>
<p>Fingerprints must be completed and adjudicated prior to services being performed under this contract<br /><br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the EQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the service unit for this purpose.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>Acceptance Period: Your proposal must stipulate that is predicated upon all terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals. <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at .] <br />(1) Listed end products. <br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.
