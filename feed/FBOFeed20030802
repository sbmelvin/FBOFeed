<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Offers for: 		High Power Stirling Assessment		    	     Synopsis Description The NASA Code S Project Prometheus Program is seeking to evaluate and possibly develop a range of technologies in support a Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP), fission powered spacecraft that is intended for use on deep space missions.  These efforts may be in the form of ground tests of hardware, design and analyses of systems, and assessments of technologies.  The NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) at Lewis Field will have oversight of projects that will focus on the power conversion and distribution systems for the NEP application.  The purpose of these efforts is to foster the development of the key technologies, and to gain data and other relevant information that may influence future decisions. NASA GRC plans to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a study regarding the use of Stirling power conversion technology for the NEP application.  More specifically, the study being requested will initially survey the state-of-the-technology for the high power Stirling application.  The SP-100 project was the last effort that developed technologies intended for this type of application, however general technology development has continued since that time and a new set of technologies that were not available in the SP-100 project may now be available.  The study will then proceed to an assessment the adequacy of the present U.S. industry to undertake the design and development of a Stirling power conversion system for the NEP application.  If it is found that the industry does not have the necessary skills, a project shall be proposed that is intended to remedy the situation.		    High Power Stirling Assessment			    Statement of Work 1.0 Overall Scope The objective of this effort is to assess the status of the technology and capability of the US industry to develop a high-power, long-life (15 years) Stirling power conversion unit for use on a Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) space mission.  The intended range of power for the system is 50kW to 300kW net DC electric power.  Net electric power is defined as the output power level available to the end user after subtracting all losses in controllers, auxiliaries, and any parasitics.  The Stirling convertors (engine, alternator, controller) must support an overall system design that combines low mass, long-life, and high reliability that is consistent with the aforementioned application.  This effort will focus on the Stirling convertor, however the overall system must be considered as system level trades and assessments are made.  The overall system includes the nuclear heat source and the heat rejection system.  Single or multiple Stirling convertors could be used as needed to achieve the total system power. This effort consists of an assessment of the state of the relevant technology and a determination of the capability of the U.S. industrial infrastructure to perform the development of a high power Stirling convertor for use on a nuclear deep space mission.  There have been numerous Stirling power conversion development efforts in the past; however the only development effort intended for use on a high power nuclear deep space mission was the SP-100 effort.  Furthermore, a range of technologies that will provide benefit to a high power Stirling convertor have advanced and/or matured during the past 10 years and are now available for use.  The availability and potential impact of these technologies must be evaluated. The infrastructure of the U.S. Stirling industry has changed in size over the years, and the capability to undertake a development effort of this magnitude is being evaluated.  The majority of Stirling power conversion development efforts have focused on power levels of 1kWe or less and have typically been intended for commercial applications.  Development of a Stirling convertor for high power deep space applications has different requirements (life, reliability, specific power, efficiency, operating temperatures) and the ability of the U.S. industrial infrastructure to meet these requirements must be evaluated. 2.0   Technology Survey and Industry Assessment Technology Survey The contractor shall survey past Stirling development efforts and determine what designs and/or technologies are available for use in a Stirling power conversion system used in an NEP application.  The survey shall include complete Stirling convertors, subsystems, and relevant components.  The technology survey shall include all aspects of the Stirling power conversion system from the thermal energy input interface to the heat rejection system interface and the DC power output from the Stirling controller. The technology survey shall utilize Technology Readiness Levels (TRL 1-9) as incorporated in NASA Management Instruction (NMI 7100) in making the assessment.  The various components of the system should be evaluated separately, possibly resulting in different TRL assessments.  Industry Assessment The contractor shall survey the various segments of U.S. industry that would be needed if the development of a Stirling NEP power system were to be undertaken.  The proposal shall define criteria and metrics to be used for industry assessment.  The contractor shall make a determination of the adequacy of the U.S. industrial infrastructure for the development, and if it is found that the industrial infrastructure is inadequate, the contractor shall develop a plan with the estimated resources necessary to establish the industrial infrastructure. Recommendation The contractor shall make recommendations for achieving launch readiness of a Stirling NEP power system for a 2011 deep space mission.  Specifically, should a preparative effort be funded to foster the advancement of specific technologies in industry prior to undertaking a flight development effort for a 2011 mission?  If so, what is the approximate scope (time & cost) of this effort? Deliverables 1.  Technology Survey and Industry Assessment Review (6 months after initiation of the contract) – A viewgraph presentation to be given at GRC that describes the results of the Technology Survey and Industry Assessment.  Draft charts to be submitted to GRC 2 weeks prior to the presentation. 2.
