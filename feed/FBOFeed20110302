<SOLNBR>2011-Q-13271
<RESPDATE>031711
<ARCHDATE>06302011
<CONTACT>Margaret L Mooney, Purchasing Agent, Email zia3@cdc.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR), hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to both, Underwriters Laboratories and FM Approvals, LLC (limited sources) for Subject Matter Expert (SME) on Certification of Intrinsically Safe (IS) Portable Electronic Equipment for Mining.
<p>PURPOSE and OBJECTIVE:<br />The overall objective of this project is to provide a well-reasoned, factual basis to support development of a formal NIOSH position that investigates whether International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Intrinsically Safe (IS) certification of <br />portable electronic devices provides at least a comparable level of safety, and to recommend whether the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) should accept such certification documentation.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />It is commonly believed that there are many portable electronic devices, which, if available to the US miner, could dramatically increase safety, health and rescue operations. Examples of such equipment are computers, personal digital assistants (PDA), advanced sensors and measurement equipment, and enhanced radios. The limited market of the US underground coal mining industry hampers the introduction of new electronic technology generally available to other industries. The appeal of the US coal mining market is further reduced when new technology must be customized to meet Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) coal mining regulatory requirements. In particular, portable electronic equipment that is used in the working section or other similarly hazardous areas must be permissible, i.e., approved as intrinsically safe (IS), housed in an explosion proof container, or properly encapsulated, as defined by MSHA regulations. The MSHA permissibility regulations represent a significant performance, reliability, cost, and time-to-market barrier to the release of state-of-the-art portable electronic devices to the US mining industry. Outside the US, the international community has its own standards for safe operation in an explosive atmosphere established by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The IEC standards are used in Europe, Australia, South Africa and other major mining countries. MSHA does not recognize the IEC IS certification; a system must be approved by MSHA to be IS in US mines, yet other hazardous US industries such as oil and gas do accept harmonized versions of the IEC standards as established by the IEC certified laboratories in the U.S. MSHA does accept testing and evaluation results from independent U.S. laboratories under 30 CFR Part 6. Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and Factory Mutual (FM) Global are listed on the MSHA website as the only two U.S. laboratories from which MSHA has accepted approval examination reports. There are in fact many international and domestic companies that supply modern communications, instrumentation, and monitoring systems for hazardous environments which are not available to US mining companies because they do not meet MSHA rules. Harmonization of the MSHA and international standards and certification procedures could dramatically increase the availability of current hazardous area products and speed the development of new technology, ultimately improving the safety of U.S. miners.<br />MINIMUM VENDOR QUALIFICATIONS <br />Contractor must represent a laboratories from which MSHA has accepted testing and evaluation results in the U.S. <br />Contractor must have demonstrated experience in certifying portable electronic devices to IEC standards. <br />Contractor must be willing to travel to the NIOSH Pittsburgh facility for up to two weeks to participate in technical discussions.<br /><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2011-Q-13271. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with both Underwriters Laboratories and FM Approvals, LLC as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price maintenance agreement contract to AB Sciex LLC, 110 Marsh Road, Foster City, CA 94404. The contract will be for a base year of 12 months with 4 option years of 12 months each.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.</p>
<p>AB Sciex LLC is the sole manufacturer of the AB Sciex mass spectrometers that is needed to be maintained. The Division of Laboratory Sciences utilizes a variety of mass spectrometers from AB Sciex to accomplish its public health mission. These mass spectrometers are used in analyses performed for chemical terrorism/emergency response, and in research and development to establish new analytical methods for a broad variety of sample types. These instruments are used in mission critical research projects and analyses for DLS, and it is crucial that they are not allowed to be off of a service agreement for any period of time.</p>
<p>While there are other independent companies that can service the mass spectrometry equipment in question, those companies will always have to contact AB Sciex for technical/software updates and factory certified replacement components. Such an arrangement could significantly slow down the process of keeping mass spectrometers maintained and repaired that are involved in mission critical experiments and that are required for emergency/terrorism response. The service engineers with AB Sciex are highly experienced with the equipment itself and with understanding the critical requirements in place due to our division's emergency response duties. Additionally their engineers have been factory trained and certified for repairs and maintenance of AB Sciex mass spectrometers as well as being experts in the repair of related gas generators from Parker Balston and Peak Scientific which are attached to AB Sciex mass spectrometers. AB Sciex sells these gas generators as part of their mass spectrometry systems and can offer service at competitive rates.</p>
<p>AB Sciex (formerly Applied Biosystems Inc.) has proven to be knowledgeable, reliable, and efficient regarding installation, repair, and maintenance of their mass spectrometers and the associated gas generators. Additionally, AB Sciex is clearly able to communicate on the status of equipment maintenance and repair projects. Their field service representatives provided prompt responses to all CDC needs. AB Sciex provides on-site, dedicated engineers so that response is virtually immediate. They also maintained an on-site inventory of replacement parts and equipment so that in the case of instrument failures repair and service requests require the least amount of time possible.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to AB Sciex LLC. CDC believes that AB Sciex LLC is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Thaddeus Rollins via email to tnr6@cdc.gov<br />using solicitation number 2011-N-13270 in the subject line, no later than 11:59 pm Eastern Time, 17 March 2011.</p>

<DESC>NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (NASA/DFRC) has a requirement for telephonyservices, to include (i) various multi-line/multiplexed circuits for connections fromDFRC to the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network); (ii) individual POTS (Plain OldTelephone System) lines for use at DFRC, and (iii) various circuits for specified use,i.e. full bandwidth Internet connectivity, DSL circuits, etc.; five (5) years.NASA/DFRC intends to acquire these services from American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T)pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies orservices will satisfy agency requirements (see attached Justification for Other than Fulland Open Competition (JOFOC)).	These services are currently provided by AT&T, theincumbent contractor and the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC) in the Edwards,California (Edwards) area.  Competition would require a Competing Local Exchange Carrier(CLEC) to establish the required infrastructure for the services in the Edwards area, theexpense and effort of which would be substantial to the Government and not expected to berecovered through competition.	There is no CLEC known in the Edwards area, especiallyone that could provide the variety and quality of the required services at a reasonableprice and without interruption in service (see attached Appendix A).  There are no knownsources to provide these services due to the exclusive rights or agreement for AT&T toprovide these services in the Edwards area.  Other possible providers, or CLECs, wouldeither rebuild the existing infrastructure with their equipment or purchase theinfrastructure services outright from the ILEC (AT&T).	This would likely result in asubstantial increase in price for the same services and may result in the inability tomeet the Government's quality and availability requirements.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities/ qualifications statements toperform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30PM(Pacific Time) on March 17, 2011.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed efforton a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solelywithin the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.   Theinstallation Ombudsman is Patrick Stoliker; (661) 276-2706 orPatrick.C.Stoliker@nasa.gov.

<DESC>In accordance with Section 3.2.1.3.11.1 of the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS), industry is hereby informed that the FAA anticipates a potential two-year (a one-year base period and one (1) one-year option period) contract requirement to provide support services to the FAA's Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Office of Organizational Effectiveness under the Strategy and Performance Business Unit in connection with measuring and improving employee engagement, as more fully and specifically described in the draft Statement of Work (SOW) attached as Attachment 1.  The purpose of this market survey is to inform industry of the potential contract opportunity and solicit capabilities statements and certain other information from interested vendors capable of providing the services set forth in the draft SOW.Interested vendors must demonstrate and substantiate that they have recent successful experience and specific knowledge in the following areas:
	Measuring employees' engagement levels by developing and administering an internet- and telephone-based survey instrument to the workforce of a large government agency.	Increasing engagement levels in teams across the organization by implementing a dynamic action planning process that directly ties to the engagement survey results. 	Measuring the impact of action plans on employees' engagement levels through one or more additional surveys.	Providing consulting services to senior leaders and managers to assist them in increasing employee engagement.
Phase 1 of the ATO's workforce engagement project began in January, 2010 and is scheduled to end in September, 2011.  Phase 1 includes a baseline employee engagement survey, action planning training for managers, and action planning and implementation at the work group and higher organizational levels. A vendor is currently providing support to the ATO in this effort.  The ATO now seeks to continue this program for up to approximately two additional years with Phase 2 and Phase 3.  The selected vendor must be ready to commence work no later than September 1, 2011. 
The specific information required to be submitted is described in Attachment 2.  The FAA intends to review all responses to gain an understanding of the knowledge, experience, and capabilities of participants in the subject market.Any vendor responding to this notice shall also complete and submit the Business Declaration Form attached as Attachment 3.
This notice is for informational and planning purposes only.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  This is not a solicitation.  This notice is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind.  This notice should not be construed as a commitment of any type by the Government to take or not to take any action. No evaluation letters or results will be issued to respondents.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to procure construction services for the Center for Operational Oceanographic in Silver Springs, MD. To plan, design and construct a sea level monitoring station on Barbuda. General Site Description: Location: Two separate islands make up the joint country of Antigua and Barbuda, located in the middle of the Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles of the Eastern Caribbean. Roughly seventeen degrees north of the equator, Barbuda is about 30 miles due north of Antigua.<br />Geography: Barbuda is a flat limestone island covering 62 sq. mi. (161 sq. km.).<br />Geology: Barbuda lies near the outer edge of the Caribbean Plate. On a regional scale, seismic events are principally associated with a subduction zone at the junction of the Caribbean Plate and the North American Plate. There is also a concentration of intra-plate activity in the Leeward Islands where the subduction of the Barracuda Rise imposes additional stresses. There are active volcanoes on the nearby islands of Montserrat, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. These conditions produce the likelihood of tsunami generating earthquakes.<br />Natural Hazards: Hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and storm surge<br />The following services are required: Contractor shall provide professional earth work and excavation services necessary to install a sea level monitoring station. Proper site preparation, backfilling and grading are necessary for the government to install a concrete pile foundation to support an elevated equipment platform. Contractor shall provide labor and equipment in the placement of four concrete piles necessary to construct a concrete pile foundation. Contractor shall provide earth trenching and concrete cutting services to install approximately one hundred (100) feet of pipe below ground. This pipe will become a conduit for water level sensor cables and tubes connected between water level measuring sensors (mounted beneath the wooden dock) to the sea level monitoring station's elevated equipment platform. Contractors shall accomplish all work required in accordance with the approved project drawings and construction specifications. <br />Contractors shall secure permission and obtain all required permits from the proper governing authorities for proper execution and completion of the work.<br />It is the Contractor's responsibility to ascertain that the Contract Documents are in accordance with applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, building codes and rules and regulations.<br /><br />Completion time for this project is 90 calendar days after award. This is a total small business set-aside. Estimated Construction cost is $0 to $25,000. Award will be made based on best value to the government. The Request for Quotation documents will be available on or about 03/08/2011 and can be uploaded from this website. Interested firms may also request a copy of the solicitation via email to the Sharon Walker at Sharon.walker@noaa.gov or by fax to 816-274-6983, referencing this announcement number. All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by the agency. This service is being procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Eastern Region, Acquisition Management Division (ERAD), requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). NO award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505. The government also encourages all contractors submit their Certification and Representation thru the on-line Business Partner Network (BPN). The BPN is the single source for vendor data for the federal government. Contractors should go on-line at www.bpn.gov. This action is set-aside for small business. NAICS code is 236220. The size standard is 500 employees.

<CONTACT>Jerry Soper, Contracting Officer, Phone 907 761-7744, Fax 907 761-7790, Email jerry.soper@ak.usda.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Alaska State Office plans to issue a Request for Bids for procurement of the following:
<p>Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, equipment, tools, and supervision for the Delta Clearwater Remediation Project located approximately 14 miles east of Delta Junction, Alaska.</p>
<p>This remediation project seeks to restore most of the existing construction site to natural conditions, to repair the armored channel near the Alaska Highway, and to disperse concentrated flows in the 1408 road corridor thereby minimizing the potential for erosion and sediment transport from the site.<br />The location of the project is (closest community) Delta Junction, ALASKA.<br /><br />The construction of the Delta Clearwater Remediation Project is planned to be staged to minimize flood risk to the project site during construction and to comply with environmental requirements such as Construction General Permit (Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans) and associated best management practices. Stage one of construction will include construction of approximately 20 water bars along the existing 1408 trail upstream from the project. Restoration of the drill line will be the second component of stage one construction. The drill line extends west approximately 9,900 feet from the west end of the existing infiltration basin. Restoration of this area consists of spreading existing spoil materials along the drill line back over the disturbed area of the drill line. These existing spoil materials currently lie along the south edge of the drill line and run for the entire length.</p>
<p>Stage two of construction is focused along the main diversion basin, side inlets, training dikes, and spoil piles of the existing project works. Work to be done in this stage includes removal of the existing training dikes, placing compacted earthfill in erosion scars, side inlets, and the main diversion basin, and removal of the existing spoil piles. The fill material obtained from removal of the training dikes and spoil piles shall be used to fill the areas mentioned above. Additional fill will also be needed and this material shall be obtained from the removal of the existing 1408 levee and off-site borrow source. The entire disturbed area will be topsoiled, covered with woody debris, seeded to temporary grass cover, and planted with live willow stakes and woody shrubs.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the work at the main diversion basin efforts shall then progress to remediation of the 1408 levee corridor (stage 3). The fill material of the levee will have already been removed as the materials will have been needed to fill the side inlets and diversion basin from stage 2. Therefore, the remediation work remaining to be done in this stage will be primarily final grading and water bar construction followed by topsoiling and spreading of large woody materials as described above for stage two construction.</p>
<p>Stage four of the remediation effort is focused on the splitting channel near the Alaska Highway. Remediation efforts on the splitting channel will involve removal of all rock riprap from the inlet slope and portions of the bottom of the splitting channel. The area where the riprap was removed shall then be covered with a graded sand filter followed by non-woven geotextile, placement of gravel bedding material on the geotextile, and finally replacement of the salvaged rock riprap and any new riprap needed to completely fill the design matrix.<br /><br />The full details of the work are as defined in the design drawings, specifications, and contract documents.<br /><br />Contractor will perform work to include controlling erosion and minimizing the production of sediment and other pollutants to water and air from construction activities.</p>
<p>Additional specifications are listed in the statement of work which will be included with the Solicitation when issued O/A March 14 , 2011. The proposed contract action is for construction the Government intends to acquire using FAR Part 14 procedures, i.e., Sealed Bid. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 - Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. The work must be completed in accordance with the specifications and drawings. <br /><br />The estimated price range is over $10,000,000. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the agency. This solicitation will not be issued in paper form.</p>
<p>Solicitation documents may be accessed for download from the Federal Business Opportunities (Fed Biz Opps) website beginning on the date of issue at the following site: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Any amendments issued to the solicitation will be posted on this website.</p>

<p>SOLICITATION NO: 11-100-SOL-00011</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 236210</p>
<p>Description:<br />THIS IS A FORMAL SYNOPSIS OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.2. THIS COMPETITIVE ACTION IS BEING PROCURED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. <br />The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the Office of Acquisitions Management, Contracts &amp; Grants (AMCG) seek to establish U.S.-based Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (the &lsquo;Centers') as public-private partnerships that share facility construction costs, facilitate development and manufacture of medical countermeasure (MCM) product candidates, ensure domestic vaccine and other biopharmaceutical manufacturing surge capacity in an emergency, and provide workforce development training programs. These U.S.-based Centers are expected primarily to provide, on a routine basis, core services that include advanced development and manufacturing capabilities of USG-supported developers of medical countermeasures for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) MCMs to address national preparedness and response priorities and needs. Additionally, HHS/BARDA requires Contractor(s) to provide new or renovated domestic facilities that utilize state-of-the art flexible and innovative manufacturing processes and platform technologies to produce CBRN biopharmaceutical MCMs under routine conditions or vaccines or other biopharmaceuticals in an emergency for outbreaks of emerging infectious pathogens including pandemic influenza or other threats. Further, HHS/BARDA requires Contractor(s) to provide a workforce development training program to enhance and maintain the nation's ability to produce these MCMs. The work performed at these Centers will be coordinated and integrated by HHS/BARDA with programs from other USG agencies to provide long-term solutions that address the medical consequences of currently known or unknown threats. The Contractor and/or subcontractors or other affiliates must be experienced in vaccine and biopharmaceutical advanced development, manufacturing, quality systems, and regulatory affairs for FDA-approved products, in addition to maintaining a facility with adequate manufacturing surge capacity in a state of readiness for an extended period of time under the contract.</p>
<p>The solicitation will include a Statement of Objectives, not a Statement of Work. The Offerors however will be required to submit a detailed Statement of Work to address these Objectives as part of their submission. There are five (5) Minimum Mandatory Eligibility Criteria for this solicitation. [1] FDA Licensure of a Biopharmaceutical Product within the Last Ten (10) Years: The Offeror or it's subcontractor thereof shall have proficiency in biopharmaceutical product licensure and/or the manufacture of licensed biopharmaceuticals (i.e. vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, well-characterized biological products). This shall be demonstrated by the Offeror or a subcontract thereof having successfully sponsored a Biologics License Agreement (BLA) or New Drug Application (NDA) leading to production of a licensed biopharmaceutical product in the United States in the past ten (10) years. [2] U.S. Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing: The Offeror shall provide in the proposal written evidence of a firm commitment that the Offeror shall establish and maintain the necessary facilities in the U.S. or its territories for core advanced development and multi-purpose manufacturing services throughout the amortized lifetime of the facility(s). [3] Cost Sharing: The Offeror shall be required to propose cost sharing for this requirement. At a minimum, the Offeror shall commit to fund fifty-one percent (51%) of the total cost of the project for the new construction of biopharmaceutical facility(s), or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total cost for the retrofit of existing pharmaceutical facility(s). [4] Surge Manufacturing Capacity of Vaccines for Pandemic Influenza &amp; Other Threats: Efforts funded as a result of this solicitation shall lead to U.S.-based manufacturing facility(s) that can be used, in an emergency, to produce, next- generation cell-, recombinant-, or molecular-based pandemic influenza vaccine to protect the U.S. population. These facilities may also be used, in an emergency, to produce vaccine or bother biopharmaceutical products against emerging infectious diseases and others threats of known and unknown origin. Therefore, the Offeror shall provide written evidence of a firm commitment to supply regulatory, quality, and production plans that will achieve a minimum of 50 million finished pandemic influenza vaccine doses within four (4) months of receipt of a Delivery Order for pandemic influenza vaccine. An Offeror that cannot identify a specific pandemic influenza vaccine candidate at the time of proposal submission shall be paired by HHS/BARDA with an appropriate vaccine candidate at the time of contract award or afterwards. [5] Training: The Offeror shall provide written evidence of a firm commitment to supply biopharmaceutical-oriented workforce development program that is aligned with current regulatory guidelines with U.S.-based, accredited academic institutions or other USG-recognized U.S.-based organizations that specialize in this area. Additional technical evaluation criteria will be identified in the RFP.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that two (2) pre-proposal conferences will be held during the solicitation period. Potential Offerors and any subcontractors are encouraged to attend. Teaming or partnering agreements (inclusive of small businesses) are highly encouraged. Small Businesses interested in subcontracting opportunites can contact the Contracting Officer or Offerors identified on http://www.FedBizOpps.gov. Multiple contract awards may be awarded as a result of this solicitation. Contract(s) awarded under this solicitation will have a base period between 2 to 8 years and option periods between 17 to 23 years depending on the successful Offeror(s) best overall approach. Option periods will not be further synopsized. Therefore, base and all option periods (if exercised) shall not exceed a maximum of 25 years. Please note that a draft RFP of this requirement was previous posted in FEDBIZOPPS under reference number DRAFT-RFP-AMCG-10-39 with subsequent questions and answers posted. Potential Offerors may review the previous posted information. However, this previous draft RFP does not represent the Government's official requirement and is no longer applicable. This final RFP, when released, is the official Request for Proposal for HHS's requirements. Information regarding the Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing can be found online at www.medicalcountermeasures.gov. HHS/BARDA will be hosting a web-based session during the term of this Synopsis to provide an overview of HHS's requirements and provide additional responses to previous comments and questions; details regarding this meeting, pre-proposal conferences dates and other public information will be posted on www.medicalcountermeasures.gov.</p>
<p>The RFP Number 11-100-SOL-00011, Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing solicitation will be issued for this requirement on or about 15 to 30 days after the release of this synopsis. The solicitation, all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the FedBizOpps. As such, no written, telephonic, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be honored. Interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements by email. Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is solely the responsibility of interested parties to monitor http://www.FedBizOpps.gov for any solicitation amendments. Any responsive and responsible Offeror may submit a proposal to be considered by the USG. This notice does not commit the USG to the award of a contract. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted. All responses should be identified with the respective solicitation number 11-100-SOL00011, name of company, business size, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of Point of Contact (POC), should be submitted to the Contracting Officer address identified in this notice.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Description:
<p>The Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Contracting Squadron, LGCI is seeking sources for ENGLISH LANGUAGE TRAINING in support of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) acquisition program located at Randolph AFB, TX. The REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) is being issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals nor quotes. No award will be made as a result of this RFI. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI. This FedBizOps sources sought notice is strictly for market research. Acknowledgment of receipt of response will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of Government's evaluation of the information received. As a result of this RFI, the Government may issue a RFP; however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to the RFI (e.g. use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement). All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business (e.g large business, small business, service disabled, HUB zone, 8(a), etc.) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611630, size standard $7.0M.</p>
<p>The source should be capable of:</p>
<p>1. Conducting an all-inclusive English language training (ELT) program to improve the English speaking, listening, reading and writing proficiency of foreign students. The goal of this program is to ensure students successfully achieve the required proficiency scores to attend various types of United States military technical training.</p>
<p>2. Using the DLIELC's American Language Course (ALC) Instructional System. Student proficiency levels upon entry will range from no proficiency to a low level of proficiency. Final proficiency levels will be determined by follow-on training. Standard instructor-to-student ratio is 1:6. Proficiency testing will be administered by the Defense Language Institute English Language Center.</p>
<p>3. Administering Field Studies Program to provide a balanced understanding of US institutions, culture and society.</p>
<p>4. Creating a comprehensive ELT program requiring a full spectrum of support. The academic area schedules students for class, coordinates instructor schedules, counsels students, administers testing and provides learning resources. The student management and support functions provide for the registration, and the health, morale, welfare and discipline of students. Finally, the program must provide mission support services (lodging, food, postal service, medical, finance, security, follow on travel services) and ensure that academic and support facilities are fully equipped and maintained, and that the necessary IT infrastructure is available.</p>

<p>Description of services</p>
<p>The Air Force requires engine turbine water wash services at 34 CONUS bases and 2 OCONUS bases (i.e., Eielson AFB, AK and Hickam AFB, HI. Initially, the Air Force will focus wash service on F108 (C/KC-135), TF39 (C-5), and TF33 (B-52, some special C-135 variants) engines with expansion to other pylon-mounted engines (e.g. TF56). The annual wash rate is expected to be approximately 1,000 engines for all engines at the associated aircraft main operating base.</p>
<p>An Engine Water Wash consists of a closed loop, on-wing engine water wash to adhere with environmental regulations at the aforementioned 36 USAF bases. The vendor will perform the wash at the CONUS USAF bases with minimal support from base resources (material and manpower). The wash system must be mobile to avoid aircraft movement and able to wash 4 engines within a 4 hour period. The wash is expected to reach the turbine area of the engine, demonstrate no adverse effects to an engine at start up speed, effectively clean the turbine area, leave no residual, and gather all residual debris from the wash.</p>
<p>Government will provide access to the aircraft, prepare engine for wash and post wash requisites. USAF crews will open cowl doors, perform any aircraft mechanical preparation required for engine wash, motor engine for engine wash process, perform post-engine wash ground run, as required to dry engine, close cowl doors, and restore engine to operating condition per applicable aircraft procedures. The vendor will provide all manpower and equipment to accomplish an engine water wash.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation but a request for information/interest. All responsible sources interested in providing services for this requirement are requested to provide a written summary of information concerning their technical certifications, capabilities, capacity, and experience. Additionally, background information will include current services or contracts, client portfolio with telephone numbers, and the company's 2010 annual report.

This acquisition will fall under NAICS 336412 and its applicable size standard (1000 people). Responses would be limited to 25 pages or less.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis is strictly voluntary. This Sources Sought Synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government's ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this RFI. All responses and questions should be forwarded to the attention of the Contracting Officer (Frederic A. Veal @ (405)734-6724, email frederic.veal@tinker.af.mil) or Diana Ashford @ (405) 734-6409, email diana.ashford@tinker.af.mil.</p>

<SUBJECT>TWIN TRAWL BYCATCH REDUCTION STUDY
<SOLNBR>NFFS7100-11-02729
<RESPDATE>031411
<CONTACT>Crystina R Elkins, Contract Specialist, Phone (206) 526-6036, Fax (206)527-3916, Email crystina.r.elkins@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Conservation Engineering Project requires a Bering Sea factory processor vessel that uses a twin-trawl system to catch groundfish in support of trawl gear research. The NAICS code for this procurement is 483114 with a corresponding size standard of 500 employees.
<p>The Government requires to charter a commercial fishing vessel that can provide paired catches from matched full-scale bottom trawls operated simultaneously, a method known as twin-trawling. The scientific design is to allow comparisons of modifications made to one of the trawls - comparing such catches measures the quantitative effects of those trawl modifications on catch rates of groundfish. Such comparisons are an essential part of studies of fishing gear modifications to reduce bycatch, unobserved mortality or the effects of trawling on seafloor ecosystems.</p>
<p>To accomplish this work, the vendor's vessel must be equipped with two identical commercial-scale trawl systems (including bridles and sweeps) and all equipment necessary (three main trawl winches, two doors and a central clump) to tow both trawls on adjacent, simultaneous paths (twin trawling). Key vessel personnel must be experienced at using this method of fishing on this vessel to capture commercial quantities of groundfish in Alaska waters.</p>
<p>Research will take place for up to 16 days between May 15th and October 15th, 2011, with the option for three additional one-year option periods with the actual survey period occurring on or about May 15 through October 15 each year.</p>
<p>Contractor must be able to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, transportation, fuel and services necessary to perform these services.</p>
<p>Field evaluations require fishing conditions representative of those of the commercial groundfish fishery, these tests require commercial-scale catches of groundfish to be captured and sampled during this charter. Capturing sufficient quantities of groundfish to represent commercial operations would make it wasteful to merely eject such fish back to the sea. The project will be done under a contract with no cost to the Government, the vessel being compensated by sale of the catch produced during the research. In addition to all facilities necessary to handle, sort and process large catches (2 - 12 tons) of mixed groundfish, the vessel must have motion-compensated flow scales installed to weigh the whole catch as it enters the sorting area and to weigh the catch of each species separately after sorting.</p>
<p>Minimum overall vessel length required is 150 feet. Minimum continuous horsepower output from main engine, 1,000hp. Minimum cruising speed of 10 knots.</p>
<p>Any future resulting contract will be awarded at no cost to the Government. Funding for the requirement is instead paid by the revenue from the sale of fish caught during the charter.</p>
<p>Submittal Requirements:</p>
<p>Firms responding to this market survey should provide only focused and pertinent information. Responding firms should provide a capability statement which should include sample and information which relates to this requirement to Contract Specialist, Crystina Elkins by email at Crystina.R.Elkins@noaa.gov by Monday, March 14, 2011 at 1:00 PST. All questions regarding this announcement should be addressed to the Contract Specialist at Crystina.R.Elkins@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately May 15, 2011. It is the Government's opinion that availability of contractors to provide this charter is severely limited, and therefore a competitive solicitation may not be issued. Should the results of this sources sought notice indicate a likelihood of competition, an official notice of the Government's intent to procure the above services will be posted at www.fbo.gov on or about March 15, 2011.</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice. Interested firms should submit in writing, (1) its name, address, a point of contact, telephone number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, and a brief narrative regarding its capability to provide the services as described above; (2) provide at least 3 examples of current and/or recently completed projects of the same or similar type of service described above. Include projects within the past 3-5 years, a brief description of the project, customer name, customer contact point and telephone number, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction, and dollar value of the project; (3) State if your company is a Small Disadvantaged Business, HubZone Small Business, or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business and provide proof of Small Business Administration (SBA) HubZone certification; (4) Indicate whether your firm will submit a proposal for this project , if this project is set-aside for HubZone Small Business ,or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; (5) Indicate all applicable personnel and sub-contractors proposed to work on the contract.

<DESC>Solicitation Number: G11PS00140Agency: USGSOffice: Remote Sensing Technologies ProjectLocation: Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center
This is an announcement directing interested parties to the Department of Interiors Business Opportunities Web Page at https Request for Information (RFI) on the need for Analog Mapping Camera Calibration://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/ where details of a U.S. Geological Survey Request for Information (RFI) G11PS00140 may be viewed.  The posted RFI contains a Synopsis, Background, Description and Questions.  All Interested Parties are invited to submit Comments and Answers to this posted RFI.  Synopsis THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICITATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES. Background & Description This Request for Information (RFI) by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Land Remote Sensing (LRS) Program and the Remote Sensing Technologies (RST) Project seeks industry feedback on the operational feasibility of the USGS Optical Science Laboratory (OSL) located in Reston, Va. The Intention is to evaluate the future of Analog Mapping Camera Calibration. The Remote Sensing Technologies (RST) Project operates the USGS OSL facility (Reston, VA.) and continues to provide calibration services for aerial film cameras used in mapping and related projects in a similar manner to the previous several decades.  Currently, the USGS OSL is the only Analog Mapping Camera Calibration Facility of its type known to be operational today.  The USGS has charged service fees covering the O&M costs since 1970s and as such is the only independent calibration facility that meets the requirements generally known in contracts for U.S. Government throughout the United States (U.S.) as well as for U.S. Government-sponsored aerial film camera work outside of the U.S.  Each analog camera used in U.S. Government contracts has been required to have a valid USGS calibration report no more than three years old at the time of imaging.  Based on this requirement, every government contracted operational film mapping camera has been obtaining the required calibration from the USGS OSL at least once every three years.  Complete details pertaining to the USGS OSL film camera calibration background, requirements, services, and report of calibration examples are documented at the following web links, respectively; http://calval.cr.usgs.gov/aerial/calval_osl/, http://calval.cr.usgs.gov/aerial/calval_osl/specifications/, http://calval.cr.usgs.gov/aerial/calval_osl/opticalcalservfees/, and http://calval.cr.usgs.gov/aerial/calval_osl/calibration_reports/.USGS is seeking industry feedback due to an awareness of multiple and simultaneous issues pertaining to the continued operation of the OSL.  Extensive communication with the aerial mapping community has resulted in an understanding that the continuing growth and adoption of digital camera technologies will eventually supersede and take over the current analog camera market share of aerial imagery acquisition.  Secondly, USGS photographic inventories necessary for its analog, multi-collimator calibration process are dwindling and their replacement has become very difficult and expensive.  As a result, the USGS OSL only has inventory and resources to operate for approximately two (2) years.  Given this projection, USGS is requesting industry feedback on the impact of closing the OSL facility when the current inventory resources are depleted, estimated to be late in the year 2012.USGS solicits industry's questions, comments, concerns, and ideas for the Government to consider relative to the seven (7) objective questions listed below. Objectives/QuestionsObjectives/Questions of this RFI include the following: 1.	Do you, or your agency/company/business, have film mapping camera calibration requirements that could be provided by the OSL beyond September 2012?  If so, briefly explain the estimated requirements?2.	Do you, or your agency/company/business, have film mapping camera calibration requirements that could be provided by the OSL beyond September 2016?  If so, briefly explain the estimated requirements?3.	Do you know of an in situ camera calibration process that you could utilize as a replacement for the traditional OSL camera calibration method?  If so, please provide contact information to discuss in situ calibration.4.	If the OSL stopped operation in the fall of 2012, what would be the impact to you, your agency/company/business, and industry?  Please provide impact information such as additional cost and quantifiable benefits or losses if available 5.	Do you foresee an industry solution or alternative for the operation of the OSL or a comparable calibration facility available beyond 2012?  Are you aware of similar services starting up or planning to start up?  If so, please provide contact information.6.	Do you foresee an industry solution or alternative to obtaining the information provided by the OSL Report of Calibration for film mapping cameras after the closure of the OSL?7.	Do you have any other comments on the OSL, the services they provide, or future operations?

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess technologies that would meet visual distress signal requirements as alternatives to pyrotechnic Visual Distress Signal Devices (VDSD). As the primary agency for maritime Search and Rescue in the United States, the Coast Guard endeavors to minimize the loss of life and injury by rendering aid to persons in distress in the maritime environment.<br /><br />The Coast Guard Research and Development Center (RDC) is conducting market research to identify technologies that are a suitable alternative to current requirements for pyrotechnic VDSDs as the final link in distress alerting and locating. The parameters include personal and vessel distress signal devices regardless of weather conditions or the time of day/night for visual detection. The common methods of detection include the unaided eye, electro-optical equipment, or other sensor types. Information on devices that rely on Light Emitting Diode (LED) , laser, or other high-intensity technology are preferred, however any viable VDSD technologies will be considered.<br /><br />This market research is intended to identify both operational and state-of-the-art technologies as potential VDSD technologies for use in the maritime environment. "Operational" in this context refers to existing technologies and equipment that are currently used in commercial and/or Government (law enforcement or Department of Defense) application, while "state-of-the-art" in this context refers to proven and near-proven technologies that can be developed for operational use in the next 30 to 36 months. <br /><br />You are invited to respond with information to assist the RDC with its market research by identifying potential sources of VDSD technologies. Such technologies would be appropriate for use by persons in the water (overboard) in distress, or deployed onboard life raft systems, recreational vessels, commercial vessels, and Coast Guard/Government vessels in hazardous conditions. <br />
<p><strong><br />SPECIFIC TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUESTED <br /><br /></strong>The following information is requested for each proposed solution. If multiple solutions are presented by the same entity, the information should be specific to each solution. <br /><br />A. Equipment specifications (Height, weight, length, waterproof, etc.);<br /><br />B. Equipment capabilities (Visibility, operational life, etc);<br /><br />C. Acquisition cost (Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) and Procurement Lead Time);<br /><br />D. If applicable, Battery life (hours of uninterrupted use at maximum intensity);<br /><br />E. Operational Applications (Maritime, terrestrial, arctic, high-altitude, etc);<br /><br />F. Space, Weight and Storage condition, and transportation requirements;<br /><br />G. Life Cycle Cost Parameters: Mean Time Between Overhaul/Failure (MTBO/F) (if applicable), Planned Maintenance requirements, Training requirements, etc;<br /><br />H. With respect to NAICS code 325998, please identify if you are a small or large business.<br /><br /><strong>RESPONDING TO THIS MARKET RESEARCH <br /><br /></strong>It is desired that responses to this RFI address all of the topics discussed in the &lsquo;<strong>SPECIFIC TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUESTED</strong>.' Topics may be combined or treated individually. However, if information is not available for some of the topic areas, your submission is still of interest.<br /><br />When addressing each RFI topic, please include the following information in the English language: <br /><br />&bull; A one-page cover letter that provides a brief summary of the response and indication if supporting documentation is included. <br /><br />&bull; Descriptive material that addresses all areas of information requested by this RFI including the section "SPECIFIC TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUESTED." If pre-developed marketing or technical information and specification sheets are provided, please include additional information, as necessary to "fill the gaps" between pre-developed material and the information required. Digital photographs, line drawings, and illustrations that clarify descriptive text are encouraged. <br /><br />&bull; If available, any digital photos and/or digital videos of the device or technology in operation.<br /><br />This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. Responses to this market survey should be sent to RDC-PF-DistressSignal@uscg.mil. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED, VOICE MAIL MESSAGES LEFT WILL NOT BE RETURNED AND EMAILS WILL NOT BE RESPONDED TO.<br /><br />Information submitted will be reviewed by Government personnel and members of the RDC's Research Development Design Services Support (RDDSS) Contractor Team, specifically Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), who will assist the Government with this effort.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistics Center has a requirement for Brand Name/Paxman Valenta Model 16RP200M Engine Parts to support the 110' WPB cutters. The intent is to award a requirements contract with firm-fixed price task orders. The USCG may split the award into more than one requirements type contract if specific parts are only available from specific prospective contractors. An Award will be made the successful offer(s) which represents the Best Value to the government, found to be the lowest price technically acceptable. The Government will allow competitive offers to be submitted for this supply; however, remanufactured or aftermarket parts are not acceptable. The Government DOES NOT possess the necessary drawings, technical specifications, etc., to evaluate other parts. This information is proprietary to the OEM. At the present time, NAICS code 336312 is a manufacturing code and there is no existing SBA Class Waiver in effect. At the present time this is an unrestricted requirement and the NAICS code for this acquisition is 333612 As such, small businesses could not meet the non-manufacturer's rule. This preludes a small business set-aside for these parts.
<p>Period of Performance: The period of performance of the contract is (1) base year and (4) option years with firm fixed price delivery orders. The USCG may split the award into more than one requirements type contract if specific parts are only available from specific bidders.</p>
<p>Place of Performance: At contractor's facility.</p>
<p>If you intend to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by email/mail to cathy.pelekakis@uscg.mil or by fax (410) 762-6306. Questions may be referred to Miss Cathy Pelekakis at (410) 762-6276. In your response you must include: (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor, and (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles and dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers. At least two references are requested, but more are desirable. Your response is required by 15 March 2011 2010, 12:00 pm (EST).</p>
<p>The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned. The Government does NOT intend to pay for information solicited. This synopsis is used pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1 and HSAM 3006.302-1. For information regarding this acquisition, contact the Contracting officials listed herein.</p>

At least two references are requested, but more are desirable. Your response is required by 9 March 2011 at 10:00 am PST. Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUB Zone set-aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUB Zone Set-Aside will apply which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern. Contractors are also reminded that should this acquisition become a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, FAR 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside will apply which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern. All of the above information must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUB Zone, Service disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside or Small Business Set-Aside.

<DESC>The Library of Congress (LC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with OCLC to continue to provide Library Bibliographic Utility Services for the FEDLINK Program. All services basically provide for interactive, contributory use of computer file systems in support of library functions. Users interact with the utility's system to conduct library operations such as cataloging, interlibrary loan, acquisitions, union listing, and reference functions. OCLC Online Computer Library Center is a nonprofit organization of cooperating library members which has developed a computerized system for creating and maintaining a regularly updated database of bibliographic holdings and other information supplied by such members and other parties, and for creating certain related products. Established in 1967, the primary basis for the organization is a union catalog of bibliographic records consisting of cataloging for items held in the majority of US libraries, more than 72,000 libraries of all types, and 170 other countries and territories. Within the OCLC system, libraries share cataloging information in the database called "WorldCat", and message one another regarding interlibrary loan requests. The size and scope of its union catalog is unique; it currently contains records identifying over 200 million individual titles, published and in manuscript, held by member libraries globally; this represents more than one billion location listings. Items cataloged in the OCLC union catalog represent approximately 470 languages, spanning over 4,000 years of recorded knowledge, in all formats (i.e. print on paper, microforms, electronic data and programs, sound and video recordings, motion pictures and broadcasts, scores, manuscripts, archives and ancient materials). OCLC provides storage and access to data created under cooperative programs in which LC and other national libraries participate, such as CONSER and the US Newspaper Program. Data is created at LC on the OCLC cataloging system for the National Serials Data Program, an IFLA program.&nbsp;<br />

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
1.  FAR 6.303-2(1) IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY, AND SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE DOCUMENT AS A "JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION." Agency: Department of the InteriorContracting Activity: NBC, Acquisition Services Division, Boise Branch 
2.  FAR 6.303-2(2) NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED. FAR 6.302-1(c)  Justification and Approval for procurement  - only one source reasonably available (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)
3.  FAR 6.303-2(3) A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE). 55 each - Breakout Harness Sets for Migratory Bird Survey System  -  to be used as standardized equipment on Kodiak 100 model aircraft, manufactured by Quest Aircraft Company LLC TOTAL $71,170.00
4.  FAR 6.303-2(4) AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. Citation: 41 U.S.C. 253(c) - This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the provisions of:  FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source
5.  FAR 6.303-2(5) A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED. In using aircraft to perform migratory bird surveys, Survey Pilots and Observers need to be able to observe bird habitat and movement and to simultaneously record observation data in multiple fields, including visual observation data, voice recordings, and GPS position locations at times of observation.  Observers also need the ability to instantly playback audio recordings through aircraft intercom system.  An aviation-PC interface box is required to allow the aircraft and PC to work together to share data and to provide continuous power to the PC.  A wiring harness is required to bundle the wires together for safety and for efficiency in connecting aircraft to PC.  System used must be lightweight because of stringent aircraft weight requirements.  System used must use aircraft avionics system because aircraft instrument panel space is limited and does not allow space required for installation of a separate survey recording system. Because the pilot must always maintain aircraft communications, the aircraft audio system must be able to convert aviation audio to PC audio through an interfaced convertor system.  Aircraft GPS position needs a PC interface so that survey GPS position can be recorded for survey data.
Because there is little or no demand for the Breakout Harness Sets Interface  system outside of those required by the Migratory Bird program, the Government has been unable to identify any other commercial off-the-shelf product available for purchase.  
Use of system identified has been reviewed and approved by the Program Manager. Technical data required to manufacture system required is not available to permit full and open competition.  To identify, develop, and test technical data to provide to potential offerors in an effort to promote full and open competition would incur an overall estimated additional cost of $25,000 - $50,000 and there is no guarantee that specifications developed would result in a workable system.  The specification data presently available reflects the minimum needs of the Government. 
6.  FAR 6.303-2(6) A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS OR WILL BE PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY SUBPART 5.2 AND, IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER 5.202 APPLIES. The proposed contract was/will be synopsized in the FedBizOpps website for government-wide point of entry.
7.  FAR 6.303-2(7) A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE. The contracting officer determines that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  8.  FAR 6.303-2(8) A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED. As new technology has been developed and become available, the migratory bird program has used systems developed for different aircraft on an individual basis by program personnel with assistance from commercial avionics technicians.  Because there has been no standardization and the harness functionality is different from aircraft to aircraft, it has made it difficult and expensive to (1) train observers, (2) troubleshoot problems, and (3) maintain existing harnesses.  The Government has purchased and successfully tested harnesses manufactured by JD Claridge Design.  
Government personnel have contacted aircraft avionics facilities and aerospace engineering firms about developing engineering specifications for aircraft breakout harnesses.  Specifications could be developed; cost is estimated at $25,000 - $50,000 and there is no guarantee that specifications developed would result in a workable system.

<SUBJECT>70--SSA-NOI-11-00001 Sole Source Intent for Open Tech Upgrade
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>
<DESC>Upgrade Capacity Ceiling of 79230 Cheryl-Watson (CW) MIPS to 85694, increase of 6507  MIPS.
The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to purchase software proprietary to one manufacturer as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1  ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?  As it stands, OpenTech is the only known manufacturer of the below listed software.
The current software licensing ceiling for the Tape/Copy product is 79,230 Cheryl-Watson MIPS; the new ceiling requested is 85,737 Cheryl-Watson MIPS, an increase of 6,507. 
The requirement for additional mainframe software licensing is due to mainframe hardware upgrades. 
In order to support these initiatives, SSA's mainframe capacity will increase by the following Cheryl-Watson MIPS: 
&#61607; System 82 - increase of 1,213 Cheryl-Watson MIPS - from a z10 2097-729 to a z196 2817-721 
&#61607; System 83 - increase of 1,445 Cheryl-Watson MIPS - from a z10 2097-730  to a z196 2817-722 
&#61607; System 84 - increase of 1,213 Cheryl-Watson MIPS - from a z10 2097-729 to a z196 2817-721 
&#61607; System 91 - increase of 333 Cheryl-Watson MIPS - from a z10 2097-708 to a z196 2817-706 
&#61607; System 92 - increase of 1,627 Cheryl-Watson MIPS - from a z10 2097-706 to a z196 2817-706 
&#61607; System 94 - increase of 676 Cheryl-Watson MIPS - from a z10 2097-706 to a z196 2817-705 
Any vendor capable of providing software that can perform the essential requirements must present electronic/written evidence of such capabilities by March 8, 2011.  The evidence must include a discussion of how the software would satisfy the proposed requirements. The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender. 
All responses must be sent to Bradley.Karbeling@ssa.gov by Tuesday, March 8, 2011 12:00pm EST.

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order for a maintenance agreement to Siemens Water Technologies Corporation, 1200 Northmeadow Parkway, Suite 100, Roswell, GA 30076. The maintenance equipment to be covered is as follows: 1) D1 Loop Systems, Clifton Road, NE, Atlanta, GA, Bldg. 18. CDC believes that this requirement can best be provided by only one provider. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy the Agency's requirements. No solicitation is being issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes/proposals, however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which, if received by the response date, shall be considered by the Agency. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government has determined that Siemens is the only responsible source for this requirement in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 since repair and maintenance must be supplied directly by Siemens to avoid invalidation of equipment warranties and/or service agreement coverages. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency. Delivery under the subsequent purchase order will be to the attention of Deborah Guess-Skinner, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Office of Infectious Diseases, National Center for Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Division of Scientific Resources, 1600 Clifton Road, NE (Roybal), Atlanta, Georgia 30333.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
In an effort to ensure continued quality care to our Veterans, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is encouraging health care facilities to pursue Magnet Designation in keeping with the ONS strategic plan and VHA strategic plan.  Research demonstrates that facilities that deploy and support Magnet principles reduces nursing turnover, increases retention, and increases partnerships.  In addition, measurable patient outcomes are improved.  In this endeavor the Veterans Healthcare System of the Ozarks (VHSO) is looking for an Accreditation 
Program that offers a Magnet Recognition Program that fulfills the strategic needs of the Veterans Administration.   In so doing the VHSO is looking for a company that has affiliation with an organization such as the American Nurses Association (ANA).  The ANA is a full-service professional organization representing the interests of the nation's 2.9 million registered nurses through its 51 constituent member nurses associations and its 24 specialty nursing and workforce advocacy affiliate organizations that currently connect to ANA as affiliates. The ANA advances the nursing profession by fostering high standards of nursing practice, promoting the rights of nurses in the workplace, projecting a positive and realistic view of nursing, and by lobbying the Congress and regulatory agencies on health care issues affecting nurses and the public. 
The Accreditation Program shall recognize healthcare organizations that provide the very best in nursing care and professionalism in nursing practice and for promoting safe, positive work environments through the Magnet Recognition Program and the Pathway to Excellence Program; and accredit providers of continuing nursing education. The Accreditation Program must offer an array of informational and educational services and products to support its core credentialing programs along with Accreditation certification exams that validate nurses' skills, knowledge, and abilities.  The Accreditation Program also should provide a vehicle for disseminating best practices and strategies among nursing systems. 
The services the VHSO may expect to receive as a result of Magnet Recognition Accreditation Program:
1.	Access to Accreditation website for information and required document formats
2.	Notification of education and events related to Magnet Recognition
3.	Comprehensive review of submitted written documentation that may also include requested additional documentation. 
4.	Services of assigned Senior Magnet Program Analyst who serves as a liaison and answers questions regarding the Magnet Program process. 
5.	Site visit once written documentation reviewed.

The benefits VHSO may expect to receive as a result of Magnet Recognition Accreditation Program:
1.	Improved Nurse recruitment and retention
2.	Improved patient outcomes
3.	Increased opportunity for health care partnerships
4.	Recognition for quality health care within and external to the VA System. 
5.	Higher patient and nurse satisfaction scores
Recognizing quality patient care, nursing excellence, and innovations in professional nursing practice, the Magnet Recognition Accreditation Program provides the ultimate benchmark to measure the quality of care that can be expected to be received.  The Magnet Recognition Program is based on quality indicators and standards of nursing practice.  The Magnet designation process includes the appraisal of qualitative factors in nursing.  The full expression of the program embodies a professional environment guided by a strong visionary nursing leader who advocates and supports development and excellence in nursing practice. As a natural outcome of this, the program elevates the reputation and standards of the nursing profession.
The Magnet Recognition Accreditation Program appraisal review process is as follows:
Appraisal Review Process: Four Phases
o Phase One: Application
o Phase Two: Written Documentation
o Phase Three: Site Visit
o Phase Four: Commission Vote

Primary Accreditation
      Accredited Provider - Provides continuing education activities 
      Accredited Approver - Approves other organizations that provide continuing
         education activities and/or approves individual educational activities 
Benefits of the Magnet Recognition Accreditation Program
      Recognition by most state licensing boards for continuing education requirements 
      Demonstrates achievement of a high standard of excellence and assures the quality of the
       CNE program
   Promotes commitment to high quality nursing practice 
Nursing Skills Competency Program
The Accreditation Program Accredits individual educational programs designed to validate nursing skills or skill sets through the Nursing Skills Competency Program (NSCP). The NSCP provides assurance for consumers, organizations and regulating bodies that nurses are competent to perform an individual skill or set of skills. 
Nursing Skills Competency Program
      Accredits individual educational programs that yield or validate a nursing skill.
The contractor identified to provide the Magnet Recognition Accreditation Program shall provide:
"	Main/initial application fee provides basic hospital information that is reviewed for acceptance into the Magnet program. 
"	Acute Care In-Patient Settings and Long Term Care, for Licensed Bed Size of 100 or less.  Inpatient and outpatient settings are subject to review for a health system to receive Magnet recognition. Outpatient fees are set in a pre-submission call with ANCC based on health system size.  A review team will be assigned to VHSO for the entire process. The Magnet appraisers will review the document to ensure Magnet written requirements are met. 
"	Outpatient Appraisal, due to the large number of OP clinics and treatment options, OP services will be included in the Magnet designation process. 
"	Documentation Review, to include Magnet Appraiser Team members and team leader.
"	Site Visit Fee to be inclusive of Travel, Hotel and Per Diem:  Note that the Department of Veterans Affairs, VHSO will pay no more than the allowable established Per Diem rate for the Fayetteville, Arkansas (Washington County) area as per the Federal Travel Regulation (chapters 300 - 302), GSA Travel Guidelines for Official Travel exceeding twelve (12) hours, to include authorized transportation expenses incurred within the Site Visit location.  The per diem allowance (also referred to as subsistence allowance) is a daily payment instead of reimbursement for actual expenses for lodging, meals, and related incidental expenses. The per diem allowance is separate from transportation expenses and other miscellaneous expenses.  The per diem or actual expense entitlement will start on the day of depart from an authorized point and ends on the day of return to the aforementioned authorized point.  The per diem allowance shall include Meals which shall be for breakfast, lunch and dinner (excluded are alcoholic beverage and entertainment expenses, and any expenses incurred for other persons) during the Site Visit and while on location; Overnight Lodging accommodations are not to exceed the established per diem rate, and shall be considered Limited Open Travel (inclusive of airfare and transportation to and from the airport).

<CONTACT>Emily Hunt, Email emily.hunt@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This synopsis, NAICS code 541611, identified as FDA1084061, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following specifications, under the simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. Hard copies will only be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.</p>
<p>1.0 Introduction</p>
<p>1.1 Background<br /><br />The ORA/ORO/Division of Federal-State Relations (DFSR) is responsible for oversight of State contract inspections. Currently, FDA conducts program assessment validation audits (hereafter known as audits) using the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS) (OMB control number 0910-0601) to determine how State food inspection programs compare to FDA's food inspection program.</p>
<p>The current DFSR staffing level does not provide for the level of expertise needed to conduct these audits. Due to competing priorities, DFSR is unable to hire and train permanent staff without causing delays in completing the audits.</p>
<p>1.2 Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of the contract is to strengthen and expand State food inspection programs. The MFRPS audits will identify elements within the State's food inspection program that need improvement.</p>
<p>1.3 Project Scope</p>
<p>This contract will provide experienced personnel to conduct and document audits of states that are implementing the MFRPS.</p>
<p>2.0 Description of Work<br /><br />The Contractor shall audit State food inspection programs against Federal Government standards including but not limited to the MFRPS.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall conduct 12 on-site audits of the State food inspection programs in the following states: AL, CO, GA, KS, MS, OK, RI, TX, VA, VT, WV, and WY. The number of days to complete the audit may vary but will not exceed five days (including travel days). The dates and exact locations of the audits will be determined by the DFSR.</p>
<p>The Contractor will participate in pre-audit meetings and conference calls if necessary.</p>
<p>3.0 Task Deliverables and Milestones</p>
<p>The Contractor shall use worksheets provided by the Government to determine if a state has partially or fully implemented the MFRPS.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall summarize audit findings and provide a report to the Government within five (5) working days after the conclusion of the audit. The Contractor shall revise the report if needed.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall review and edit the final audit report if requested.</p>
<p>Prepare all documents typed in 8 &frac12; x 11 letter format within the period of performance. All documents are to be submitted in electronic form and in the native file format of MS Word 2000 or a later version of that software.</p>
<p>4.0 Period of Performance: One year from date of award.</p>
<p>5.0 Location, Work Schedule, and Travel</p>
<p>The Contractor shall comply with the deadlines set forth in this contract. Work will be performed off-site.</p>
<p>6.0 Security and Privacy</p>
<p>It is not anticipated that the Contractor will be exposed to sensitive Agency information or data. But, the Contractor agrees that contract personnel will not divulge or release information or data developed or obtained in connection with performance of this contract, unless made public by FDA or upon written approval by the Project Officer.</p>
<p>7.0 Contractor Conformance with Applicable Laws, Regulations, Policies, and Standards</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for knowledge of and compliance with all applicable federal information technology and information management laws, regulations, policies and standards at the government-wide, HHS, and FDA levels. At the government-wide level, these include Office of Management and Budget (OMB), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and General Accounting Office (GAO). These can be primarily found at or through the Federal CIO Council website at: http://www.cio.gov. HHS documents are found at http://www.cdc.gov/irmo</p>
<p>8.0 Payment Terms</p>
<p>The Contractor shall submit the cost per audit (include on-site audit, documenting audit findings, and review and revise final audit report).</p>
<p>For each 90-day period of the contract (based upon the performance period), a Quarterly Summary Report (Form FDA 2684) of the audits and travel expenses shall be prepared. Included with the report shall be the contract number, a list of audits completed specifying the name and city of the state agency, and audit dates. In those periods where no audits were performed, a report showing no audits is required.</p>
<p>A proper invoice is required. Invoices will be approved at the negotiated rate along with submittal of the Quarterly Summary Report. Invoices will not be approved without the Quarterly Summary Report. Therefore, timely submission is critical to expedite voucher/invoice processing and payment. Payment will be made after the deliverables are reviewed by DFSR.</p>

<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important than cost or price.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2, EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>

<p>C. Past Performance</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information to determine its relevance to the current requirements and the extent to which it demonstrates that the Offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years. The Government will assign a neutral rating to Offerors with no relevant past performance information within the past three years or for which past performance information was reasonably unavailable. The Government may also obtain past performance information from sources other than those provided by the Offeror in its quotation to complete its evaluation of this factor.<br /><br />D. Price</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate whether the quoted cost/price is fair and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements and consistent with the Offeror's proposed Technical Approach. If appropriate, the Government may perform cost realism analysis.</p>

<p>The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by "bridges". The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics. The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals. The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.</p>

The total number of provisions within each Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses. <br />&bull; Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type. Some of these may not be features of the vendor's deliverable. Conversely, others not noted may be features of the vendor's deliverable. If the deliverable includes additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered.<br />&bull; Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard. Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the deliverable.<br />&bull; Column four is a summary of the vendor's response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the Standard.<br />&bull; Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected applicable provisions and actual product features.</p>

In the event of a modification(s) to the contract/order, which adds new EIT products and services or revised the type of, or specifications for, products and services the Contractor is to provide, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, the Contracting Officer may require that the contractor submit a completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template to assist the Government in determining that the EIT products and services support Section 508 accessibility requirements. Instructions for documenting accessibility via the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found at http://508.hhs.gov. [(End of HHSAR 352.270-19(b)]</p>
<p>Prior to the Contracting Officer exercising an option for a subsequent performance period/additional quantity or adding increment funding for a subsequent performance period under this contract, as applicable, the Contractor must provide a Section 508 Annual Report to the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (also known as Project Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative). Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer in writing, the Contractor shall provide the cited report in accordance with the following schedule. Instructions for completing the report are available at: http://508.hhs.gov. under the heading Vendor Information and Documents.<br />The Contractor's failure to submit a timely and properly completed report may jeopardize the Contracting Officer's exercising an option or adding incremental funding, as applicable.</p>

<p>Introduction <br />Section 508 of the amended Rehabilitation Act ("Section 508") was enacted to eliminate barriers that might interfere with the ability of individuals with disabilities to fully access Web-delivered information and fully utilize Web-based tools and services. Section 508 requirements apply to Web sites, including all forms of information and posted content, as well as any associated applications including Web or media. <br />This interim acquisition policy provides language applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use - to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. The project officer (also known as the contracting officer's technical representative) must ensure that communications products produced or delivered by contractors or consultants meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards and are suitable for posting to an HHS Web site. <br />Discussion and Analysis <br />This policy applies to: <br />1. HHS Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions (OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs) and to their contractors and consultants that produce new reports, brochures, and other text or graphical communications products, or produce new multimedia products, such as videotapes and Webcasts, or provide computer based training materials or products. <br />2. HHS OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs and to their contractors and consultants that provide new Web-based product support documentation to end-users.</p>
<p>This interim acquisition guidance does not apply to those systems covered by the specific Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) guidance (dated January 16, 2008) for the acquisition of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) (including Web-based applications, software packages deployed through the Web and script-based interactive sites). <br />This interim acquisition guidance is effective upon issuance for all new acquisitions. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 2 <br />Responsibilities <br />The Assistant Secretary for Resources and Technology (ASRT) shall: <br />Provide policy and procedural support with respect to establishing, implementing, operating and maintaining Web sites or producing communication products and services. <br />The Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA) shall: <br />Propose Section 508-compliant performance standards, provide guidance for their implementation, and ensure that HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web sites are in compliance with Section 508. Guidance and training is available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/policies/index.html#508. <br />Develop training and technical assistance materials to support OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs in the use of this guidance. <br />Appoint a representative to the HHS Section 508 Program Team to ensure alignment with ongoing Departmental Section 508 activities. <br />The Director of the Office on Disabilities (OD) shall: <br />Approve and interpret Section 508-compliant performance standards. <br />Disseminate updated guidance and policy interpretations through http://508.hhs.gov/. <br />Provide technical support to OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs in determining the application of Section 508. <br />Share best practices through the Section 508 Program Team. <br />Review lessons learned and coordinate with ASPA necessary updates to Section 508 guidance. <br />The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Management and Policy (DASAMP) shall: <br />Ensure the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) is modified to incorporate the interim Section 508 guidance provided in this document and ensure that it enhances and supports existing Section 508 guidance. <br />OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs shall: <br />Ensure that HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web sites are in compliance with Section 508. <br />Ensure that the staff receives training and technical assistance regarding Section 508.US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 3 <br />Interim Acquisition Guidance <br />For new actions, while developing or amending a SOW or PWS in accordance with HHSAR 307.7106 (renumbered HHSAR 307.7108) and FAR 37.602, project officers must address communications products and services in the HHS Acquisition Plan. In addition to the acquisition planning requirements under HHSAR Part 307, project officers must address Section 508 compliance requirements for documents generated for and by HHS that require a contractor or consultant to produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. <br />For those acquisitions of communications products and services not requiring an Acquisition Plan, the Project Officer must include all documentation pursuant to HHSAR 307.7101(c). The assigned project officer (contracting officer's technical representative) will ensure communication products are provided to the end-users in a Section 508- compliant format. <br />The project officer must list the applicable provisions of the Access Board Final (36 CFR Part 1194) in the SOW/PWS - e.g., "36 CFR 1194(a)-(j)". Most Web-based text and communication will need to meet 36 CFR Part 1194.22, "Web-Based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications". Additionally, 36 CFR Part 1194.41, "Information, Documentation and Support," and 36 CFR Part 1194.24 "Video and Multimedia Products" are of particular importance with regard to all written, graphical or broadcast, video materials or products produced for HHS (to include training). 36 CFR Part 1194.41 outlines the requirements supporting services for products accommodating the communication needs of end-users with disabilities. Contact your OPDIV/STAFFDIV Section 508 Coordinator for additional assistance in determining the applicable provisions. <br />The Project Officer (the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative), in consultation with ASPA/Web Communications Division, will make a Section 508-compliance determination prior to posting to a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. <br />The project officer shall include the attached "Section C.A. Section 508" language in Statements of Work (SOWs) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for communication products and services that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 4 <br />C.A. Section 508 <br />This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. <br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. <br />There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board's Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board's standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). <br />Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material. <br />1 Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 5 <br />The following Section 508 provisions apply to the content or communications material identified in this SOW or PWS: <br />[Project Officer must list the applicable provisions of the Access Board Final Rule (36 CFR Part 1194) - e.g., "36 CFR 1194.21(a)-(j)"] <br />References: <br />HHS Policy for Section 508 Electronic and Information Technology (E&amp;IT) (January 2005): http://www.hhs.gov/od/Final_Section_508_Policy.html <br />HHS Section 508 Web site: http://508.hhs.gov/ <br />HHS ASPA Web Communications Division Web site: <br />http://www.hhs.gov/web/policies/index.html <br />US General Services Administration (GSA) Section 508 Web site: http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is soliciting quotes for a contractor to provide services for the special processing of slides.<span>&nbsp; </span>The NEFSC collects fish gonad tissue samples and prepares this tissue for further processing by a histology laboratory. The scope of work is that the contractor shall provide final processing of the tissue which will be examined to study the reproductive biology of fish. The results of the work will be used in stock assessments, other reports, on the NEFSC website, as part of the new FSCS system, and in peer-reviewed publications.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">A new and important initiative for Population Biology Branch is to expand into reproductive studies of marine fishes, particularly economically-important groundfishes. The Chief of Population Biology has considerable experience with this type of research and is spearheading design and implementation of these studies. Histology is an essential component of this type of work. Histology is a highly technical laboratory process. It involves special chemicals (many of which are toxic), sophisticated equipment and trained staff: all of which are costly to purchase and maintain. Approximately 2000 samples are collected each year, the fresh tissue is fixed in 10% formalin. Later, the fixed tissue is rinsed, trimmed, and placed in a standard histology cassette. Prior to delivery, the cassettes are stored in gallon jars of 70% ethyl alcohol. A special staining technique, Schiffs-Mallory Trichrome (SMT) is to be used on these tissues at the histology processing laboratory (See Attachment 1).<span>&nbsp; </span>SMT enhances cytological features associated with processes of fish maturation and spawning events &ndash; cellular processes that are critical to this research.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Work shall be performed in a histology facility capable of processing large batches of slides (500-1000) within a 1-3 months period of time after delivery. <span>&nbsp;</span>Samples shall be placed in paraffin wax, and thin sections (5 &mu;m) of embedded tissue shall be stained using Schiffs-Mallory trichrome (SMT) stains. The contractor facility shall be local within 150 miles of the Government facility as to avoid long distance travel and complex, costly shipping requirements associated with a large volume of tissue samples mixed in flammable chemical preservatives (ETOH = ethyl alcohol) .</span></p>

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the information in FAR Subpart 12.6, using simplified acquisition procedures under the test program for commercial items found at FAR 13.5, as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued. PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE. This combined synopsis/solicitation shall be posted on both FEDBIZOPPS and NECO (http://www.neco.navy.mil/). The RFQ number is N00244-11-T-0124. This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-49 and DFARS Change Notice 20110222.
 It is the contractors responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.acqnet.gov/far and http://www.acqnet.gov/far  and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dfars/index.htm .  The NAICS code is 334220 and the Small Business Standard is 750 employees.  

The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
 However, all bids, proposals, or quotations received by the closing response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

The acquisition is for acquisition of the below listed Intuicom, Inc. transceivers and related equipment from the OEM, Intuicom, Inc. Boulder, CO.  The equipment is for use to replace faulty units, to support additional participants, and to extend range-tracking coverage to areas in and around El Centro, CA; ANG Townsend Range, GA; and MCAS Cherry Point, NC; and Det.
 Astor Bombing Range, FL.   As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Intuicom possesses the only complete design, development and configuration plans and specifications to work with the existing GTS system.  In addition to the electrical specification, the integrated GPS receiver outputs a special customized proprietary data string and format.  The current government-owned tracking software is specifically designed to process and handle this special data string.   Intuicom has the proprietary rights to the source code, GPS data string format, and system configuration. The Government does not have adequate specifications for a competitive procurement of the Intuicom hardware.  Substitution of alternate equipment would require extensive testing and evaluation to determine if the required parts would meet the form, fit, and function compatibility requirements of the current deployed system.

<p><br />ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 
     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
 
     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
 
       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
 
     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 
     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Questions and Responses

Question 1) Does the applicant need to be larger (or smaller) in revenues than the small business size standard of $7,000,000?  
Response: All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.

Question 2) Will the contact information for caregivers be readily available to the Contractor?  
Response: Caregiver contact information will be provided to the Contractor by the Caregiver Support Coordinator.  This will be provided in a manner that will meet HIPAA requirements for privacy protection of the caregiver and Veteran.

Question 3) Based on the pricing schedule, it appears that the VA does not include in this contract the development of a training delivery model that can be enhanced through ongoing stakeholder feedback.  Is this correct?
Response: The Contractor will collect evaluations of the curriculum materials/classes from participants as well as measures of caregiver and Veteran satisfaction with the curriculum.  This information will be used to make adjustments to content and curriculum delivery. 

Question 4) How many VA staff are expected to be trained through Train-the Trainer?  
Response: In the first year, 500 VA staff are expected to be trained.

<DESC>**QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ADDED AS ATTACHMENT - 3/02/2011**
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), through the Office of the Chief Counsel (AGC), requires professional legal services to provide support and to supplement in-house legal resources for the FAA's environmental work.  
Legal help is needed to assist in the review and preparation of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) or Environmental Assessments (EAs), pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and related environmental statutes for airport development and reconstruction and the defense of litigation associated with these projects.  Currently, the FAA has numerous airport development and reconstruction projects in progress or slated for future development. Ordinarily these airport development and reconstruction projects increase operational efficiency at airports and are often directed at expanding capacity and reducing delay within the national transportation system.  
This work is specialized for the federal government, i.e., not a commercial item.  The attorneys engaged in performing this effort will be serving FAA in a professional legal capacity and will be bound, as applicable, by all privileges and other professional obligations that attach to this relationship.
The period of performance for this effort will be from the Date of Award through twelve consecutive months, with four additional one-year options to be exercised at the discretion of the Government.
This is a Full and Open procurement with applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541110 (Offices of Lawyers) with a size standard of $7.0 million.
Interested parties responding to this solicitation are directed to the attached Screening Information Request (SIR).  All questions/inquiries must be provided in writing by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) Friday, February 25, 2011 to Janella Davis at janella.davis@faa.gov.  Proposals are due by 2:00 PM EST on Monday, March 14, 2011. See Section L of the SIR for more information on submittal of proposals and written inquires. 
Prospective offerors are hereby on notice that any amendment(s) issued to this SIR will be published on this website http://www.faaco.faa.gov under the current announcements for the FAA Headquarters. It is the Offerors' responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement. 
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the SIR, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement.
This announcement does not obligate the Government to award any effort resulting from SIR DTFAWA-11-R-00066.

<a href="mailto:GILHAM.MICHAEL@EPAMAIL.EPA.GOV">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   This RFQ is being amended to provide answers to vendor questions and to extend the response deadline to 3/8/11 at 4 pm Eastern Standard Time.  Any futher technical questions must be received - at the e-mail address in the original posting - by 12pm EST on 3/3/11.Questions and answers are as follows:
1)  For 24 sample minimum: can you give min and max dimensions?  What about concentrations?  Furthermore, will they be solids, liquids, powders or other?  Will they be a combination?
NEIC usually, although not always, has large sample amounts to work with.  As for sample sizes presented to the instrument, most will fall in the 20 to 40 mm in diameter range. NEIC requires the capability to determine concentrations ranging from the lowest possible trace levels to 100%.  It must analyze environmental samples as well as industrial waste materials, and this requirement means a wide range of concentrations will be encountered.  NEIC require the ability to analyze liquids and powders in a helium atmosphere.  It analyzes solids, pressed pellets, filters, and other materials under vacuum.  Furthermore, NEIC receives samples of mixed phases, gels, emulsions, etc. that demand a flexible instrument and careful preparation.      
2) Are you interested in mapping?
NEIC is not interested in mapping for this instrument.
3) What is the lowest element of interest?  Is it Sodium?
Yes, sodium is the lowest element in the periodic table that NEIC needs to measure by XRF.  NEIC requires the ability to measure most of the elements between sodium and uranium in the periodic table.  This is at concentrations from trace levels to major amounts.
4) Any reason for polarized optical geometry?  Has that been shown to be superior to others?
It is well known that polarized X-ray optics reduce background and thus detection limits.  This has been reported quite often in the scientific literature.  For example "Background reduction in X-ray fluorescence spectra using polarization", by T.G. Dzubay, B.B. Jarrett and J.M. Jakievic, in Nuclear Instruments & Methods, Vol 115, Feb. 1974, pages 297-299.

These responsibilities include regular contact and collaboration with the counterparts in Rwanda's National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and other government ministries and agencies, as well as in a wide range of civil society and private organizations, other donor and international organizations, and other United States Government (USG) entities working in malaria prevention and control. The PMI Resident Advisor shall exercise independent judgment in planning and carrying out tasks, in representing the USG in critical technical and policy forums, in resolving problems and conflicts, and in taking steps necessary to meet deadlines. The PMI Resident Advisor will formulate and advise on policy documents, manage contracts and grants, budgets, and develop planning documents and work plans. <br />The incumbent must possess technical expertise in the area of malaria prevention, treatment and control, and possess an understanding of the social, economic and cultural determinants and implications of the epidemic in Rwanda and neighboring countries, as well as have the experience and skills required to help formulate the USG position on malaria and make important policy decisions as a key representative of the USAID/Rwanda Mission. <br />USAID/Rwanda Health Portfolio</p>
<p>USAID/Rwanda's health portfolio has grown from $25 million in FY 2004 to $124 million in FY 2010, including the introduction of four Presidential Initiatives: the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) and President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the newly announced Feed the Future and Global Health Initiatives. In addition, Rwanda is a priority country for the Administrator's reforms under USAID Forward and new health strategies to promote Best Practices at Scale in the Home, Community and Facilities (BEST). The Mission has organized management of the health portfolio under a team vision "to build capacity in Rwanda for sustained and improved health outcomes by providing innovative and responsive technical and financial assistance." The organizational structure reflects integrated programming across funding streams and includes three teams: Health and Social Welfare Promotion, Health Service Delivery, and Health Systems Strengthening. Each team has developed its vision and expected results, and manages an integrated portfolio of activities. PMI goals and supporting activities are a high priority and key components of all three teams, with the majority managed primarily within the Health Service Delivery Team.</p>
<p>Rwanda is one of eight GHI Plus countries under President Obama's Global Health Initiative (GHI) to helps partner countries improve health outcomes through strengthened health systems, with a particular focus on improving the health of women, newborns and children through programs including infectious disease, nutrition, maternal and child health, and safe water. Under GHI, the USG Rwanda health team will further the GHI business model based upon the GHI's core principles, drawn from the principles of effective development announced by President Obama at the G-8 meeting in L'Aquila. This business model includes:<br />&bull; Implementing a woman- and girl-centered approach<br />&bull; Coordination, collaboration, and integration at all levels<br />&bull; Strengthening and leveraging other efforts<br />&bull; Partnership with countries<br />&bull; Learning and accountability</p>
<p>Similarly, Rwanda is one of 28 countries selected to launch USAID's Best Practices at Scale in the Home, Community and Facilities (BEST). BEST is a process to ensure that, under the Global Health Initiative, USAID applies state-of-the-art programming in family planning, maternal and child health, and nutrition (FP/MCH/N) programs that draws on evidence-based interventions. It hypothesizes that a degree of integration relevant to a country's specific situation will be one characteristic of state-of-the-art programs and reaffirms USAID's commitment to the three areas of programming, strengthens our technical leadership and scales up proven interventions. The BEST planning process will build on our ongoing work and integrate programs where it makes sense to do so to contribute significantly to the ambitious goals the GHI has set for target countries:<br />&#9642; Preventing 54 million unintended pregnancies<br />&#9642; Reducing maternal mortality by 30 percent <br />&#9642; Reducing under-five child mortality by 35 percent <br />&#9642; Decreasing child under nutrition by 30 percent, in conjunction with the Feed the Future food security initiative.</p>
<p>One key principle of the GHI approach is to achieve "smart" integration. BEST facilitates this approach in relation to FP/MCH/N, and encourages integration with HIV/AIDS, other health elements and other sectors, including PMI, where doing so is a pathway to reaching program goals and objectives. BEST recognizes that integration is not an end in itself, but is a potential facilitator for achieving increased availability of key services, cost-savings or sustainability. BEST also recognizes that we lack an evidence base regarding whether, how and under what circumstances integration leads to improved health outcomes and health impact. Therefore, countries' plans will identify ways to provide additional learning in order to promote "smart" integration.</p>

<DESC><BR>1.	 This is amendment number 3 to Special Notice previously published under Draft Solicitation W91260-11-R-0003.  The purpose of this announcement is to provide notice that the Questions and Answers (Q&A's) received from industry shall be uploaded to the bidder's library.  This announcement shall also provide additional guidance concerning the site visit to Wahiawa, HI 24 Mar 11.  In addition, direction is provided for offerors with Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) concerns.<BR><BR>2.  Q&A's:  A consolidated list of answers to questions received from industry shall be uploaded to the bidder's library (https://www.us.army.mil).  Interested vendors desiring access should refer to prior FedBizOpps postings for instructions.    <BR><BR>3.   SITE VISIT TO WSOCS SITE IN WAHIAWA, HI on 24 Mar 11:  All vendors attending the site visit to Wahiawa are reminded that the required access information must be submitted to theresa.coffenberry@us.army.mil and jen.d.baker@us.army.mil by 8 Mar 2011.  Attendance at this site visit is voluntary.  Failure to attend any of the site visits does not constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.   Due to space limitations, interested vendors are allocated space for two individuals to attend. <BR><BR>4.  During one-on-one discussions, it came to the Government's attention that questions concerning OCI remain.  The following information is provided to address OCI concerns. <BR><BR>a.  Each proposal must include an OCI mitigation plan.  Section M sets forth two requirements the offeror must address:  (1) any OCI issues the Prime and/or the team have identified and what steps have been taken to avoid, neutralize or mitigate those concerns (see FAR 9.5); and (2) the plan/process to identify and manage any OCI concerns which may arise during contract performance.  <BR><BR>b.  If an offeror identifies a significant OCI concern before final solicitation issuance that may possibly prohibit participation in the WSOTS solicitation, the offeror may provide the facts and analysis to the contracting officer.  The Government will review the circumstances and provide a non-binding opinion if vendor would be prohibited from participating in the WSOTS acquisition.  <BR><BR>c.  All requests shall be submitted to theresa.coffenberry@us.army.mil and jen.d.baker@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>5.  Additional information, as it becomes available will be posted as well as amendments to this announcement and will be available for viewing on Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi and Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) https://www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to review these sites frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>1.0 SCOPE
1.1
Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide technical specifications for the competitive procurement of replacement desktop computers. The procured replacement desktop computers will consist of all hardware, software, accessories, and installation and manuals required for the computers operation and shall meet or exceed the functional requirements as outlined henceforth.
1.2
Intended Use
The desktop computers will be utilized by the Rapid Prototyping and Fabrication Department at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center-Division Keyport. The equipment shall be used primarily for supporting gyro production in the electrical shop.
1.3
General Description
In the Rapid Prototyping and Fabrication Department at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center-Division Keyport there is a need for fast, reliable and up to date computers for gyro production support and engineering support.
 The current desktop computers in place have fit the needs of gyro production and engineering support well but time has inevitably taken its toll on their performance. Not only has there been signs of slow down through the normal wear and tear of the hardware, but the technology available on the market greatly exceeds the performance of the existing desktop computers. Therefore a need to upgrade and replace the current desktop computers exists. Up to date desktop computers would improve gyro production efficiency and increase engineering productivity.
2.0 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
2.1 Operating System
The desktop chosen must be capable of running Mac OS X as its primary operating system. In order to upgrade the computers while maintaining the current system and data in gyro production, it is essential for the new computers to be capable of running Mac OS X.
 Also, most of the licensed engineering development tools used by the electrical engineers are run in the Mac OS X environment.
2.2 Processor
The processor for the replacement desktop computers must use the 2.93 GHz Intel i7 Quad Core or equivalent. The processor for the replacement desktops must exceed the performance of the processors in the current desktop computers by a great margin. This will be necessary to keep the lifespan of the upgraded computers reasonable (about 5 years).
2.3 Memory
The memory for the upgraded computers shall meet or exceed the following requirements. Computers not meeting the requirements shall not be considered.
2.3.1 Quantity
The upgraded computers must have at least 8 gigabytes of RAM.
 With technology improving at a rapid rate, 8 gigabytes of RAM would not be costly and would improve the lifespan of the computers.
N00253-11-P-0229
Page 7 of 22
2.3.2 Type
The upgraded computers must use 1333 MHz DDR3 SDRAM. DDR3 SDRAM is the most up to date type of memory and performs better than the previous versions of RAM (DDR, DDR2, etc). It will also extend the lifespan of the computers.
2.4 Hard Drive
The hard drive for the upgraded computers shall meet or exceed the following requirements. Computers not meeting the requirements shall not be considered.
2.4.1 Quantity
The hard drive for the upgraded computers must have at least 1 terabyte of memory. Because sufficient data storage is essential to the gyro production, the replacement computers must be equipped with large and reliable hard drives.
2.4.2 Type
The hard drive for the upgraded computers must be serial ATA hard drives.
 This is the standard hard drive for todays computers.
2.5 Graphics Card
The replacement desktop must use a graphics card that contains at least 1 GB of dedicated memory. A sufficient video card is necessary to run the Mac OS X operating system smoothly. It will also assist in running complex graphical tools that support the engineering development process. The ATI Radeon HD 5750 graphics card is recommended.
2.6 Monitor
The hard drive for the upgraded computers shall meet or exceed the following requirements. Computers not meeting the requirements shall not be considered.
2.6.1 Size
The monitor for the upgraded desktop must have a diagonal length of at least 27. This will help make data and graphs easier to read as well as reduce eye strain on workers who may have to use these computers often.
2.6.2 Arrangement
The monitor of the upgraded computers shall be in the same unit as the computer itself.
 This arrangement should save valuable desk and table space. Alternative arrangements will be considered if it can be proven that space efficiency is equivalent or improved.
2.6.3 Viewing Angle
The viewing angle for the monitor should be at least 178 vertical and 178 horizontal. Smaller viewing angles could cause eye strain if multiple workers need to view the monitor.
2.6.4 Display Colors
N00253-11-P-0229
Page 8 of 22
The monitor display for the upgraded computers must have at least 16 million colors. If the number of colors falls below 16 million, the images on the monitor will suffer greatly in quality and may impede work progress.
2.6.5 Resolution
The monitor of the computers to be considered must be able to support the following resolutions: 2560 by 1440, 1920 by 1200, 1280 by 800, and 1024 by 640.
 The adjustable resolution will make it easier to accommodate the visually impaired and create a better quality image on the monitor.
2.7 Optical Drive
The optical drive for the upgraded computers shall meet or exceed the following requirements. Computers not meeting the requirements shall not be considered.
2.7.1 Type
The upgraded computer must have an 8x Superdrive or equivalent optical drive. An optical drive of this type and speed will improve software loading times and overall efficiency in computer performance.
2.7.2 Reading Capability
The optical drive must be able to read compact discs (CDs) and digital video discs (DVDs) at a minimum. The upgraded computers must have the capability to read and load CDs and DVDs in order to perform all the tasks that are required.
2.7.3 Burning Capability
The optical drive must be able to burn DVD-R and DVD+R discs at 8x speed.
 It must also be able to burn CD-R discs at 24x speed. Additional burning capabilities would be preferred but would not be necessary. Having the capability to burn data to CDs and DVDs is essential for backing up gyro production data.
2.8 USB Ports
The upgraded computers must have at least 4 USB 2.0 ports. In order to fully support all of the functions required, the replacement computers must have a sufficient number of USB ports to support various peripheral hardware (keyboard, mouse, portable hard drive, etc.)
2.9 Communication
The replacement computers must have a 10/100/1000BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet port. An Ethernet port is essential for networking the computers for both the electrical shop in building 98 and building 82.
 Wireless modems cannot be used as a substitute for networking.
2.10 FireWire
The replacement computers must have a FireWire port. FireWire is essential for an easy transition to the replacement computers as it provides a convenient link between computers for fast data transfer.
2.11 Speakers
N00253-11-P-0229
Page 9 of 22
The replacement computers must have built-in speakers. These speakers are to be located on the interior of the computer case. It is important for the computers to have built in speakers to be able to hear alerts from the computer and to avoid hassle and mess of exterior speakers and head-phones.
2.12 Keyboard
The replacement computers must have a keyboard with a numeric keypad.
 The numeric keypad increases the efficiency of entering data and making numeric calculations. A keyboard without this feature shall not be considered.

Justification Review Document

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Organization:  VA Black Hills Health Care System, Fort Meade, SD

2.  Description of Action:  A Firm Fixed-Price contract is contemplated for acquisition of  A/E design 
services for project 568-11-121, Quarters 144 Women Veteran Hoptel Conversion.

3.  Description of Commodities:  Work consists of awarding an A/E contract for design services for project 568-11-121, Quarters 144 Women Veteran Hoptel Conversion.   Services include preliminary and working design drawings, construction period services, and required site visits. 

4.  Statutory Authority:  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5, Authorized or required by statute is being cited.  Specifically, Sections 502 and 503 of Public Law (P.L.) 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Health Care and Information Technology Act of 2006, currently implemented by Office of Acquisition and Logistics Information Letter (IL) 049-07-8, the Veterans First Contracting Program.

5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  The contractor, FourFront Design, Inc., is a service disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB).  They have successfully completed numerous A/E design projects at this medical center in the last 3 years.  Most of these projects were completed as task orders against a VISN 23 IDIQ A/E contract, however the IDIQ contract has expired and a new VISN 23 IDIQ A/E contract for design services is not yet in place. The facility also has contemplated utilizing a Sioux Falls VAMC IDIQ A/E contract for design services but the contract was not initially set up for multi-site use and is thus unavailable for use by this facility.  The design phase for this project must be initiated as soon as possible to ensure NRM construction funds are obligated prior to the end of June to meet VA obligation deadlines.  If the deadline is not met, funds may be withdrawn and this project, which is needed to support identified veteran patient needs, would be delayed or cancelled.  Therefore, we are seeking approval to use FourFront Design, Inc. as a sole source contractor for the required A/E design services.
  
6. Sources Solicited:  FourFront Design Inc. is the only registered SDVOSB A/E firm found in South Dakota when conducting market research.  They have held a VISN 23 A/E IDIQ contract.   They have recently completed and are currently working on several similar project designs at this facility. They have available designers and are in a position to proceed with design services as soon as given approval to proceed.  No other SDVOSB sources were found during market research.

7.  Market Research Conducted:  The Central Contractors Registry and VetBiz were searched for available SDVOSB A/E firms in the serviceable area and only FourFront Design, Inc. was identified.  Due to the urgent need to initiate a design contract for this project in order to maintain a timely schedule for the construction phase, no further market research was conducted. 

8. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:  Fort Meade VA has  awarded several task orders to Four Front Design against a VISN 23 IDIQ A/E contract which expired at the end of  FY2010. They are a local SDVOSB that has a proven track record for providing expedited construction designs for VA projects. They are familiar with VA design criteria, construction standards and  the Fort Meade site. 

10.  Actions to remove Barriers to Competition: When the VISN 23 IDIQ A/E contract is available it is anticipated future designs will be initiated as task orders against the VISN 23 IDIQ contract. Also, VABHHCS is considering initiating local facility IDIQ contracts in the future. 

11.  Fair and Reasonable Price:  Pricing for previous work performed by this contractor has always been in line with Government estimates.  The government estimate to complete this work is $30,000.
 
12.  Contracting Officer's Certification:  Based upon the information provided herein, I believe the justification for awarding this project design to FourFront Design, Inc. on a sole-source basis is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and recommend we proceed as such.

Justification Review Document

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Organization:  VA Black Hills, Fort Meade, SD


2.  Description of Action:  A Firm Fixed-Price contract is contemplated for acquisition of Architect/Engineer construction period services for Project 568-CSI-001, Fixed MRI Site Preparation.


3.  Description of Commodities:  This work will consist of A/E services during construction, including site visits by designers.  Design services for this project were performed by FourFront Design under a separate contract, which was funded by a design-only FY 2009 project.  Construction is now authorized under a new project, 568-CSI -001.  It is now necessary to contract for the A/E services which will be required during construction.  The only logical source for these services is the firm that performed the design services, FourFront Design.  Since FourFront Design no longer has an active IDIQ contract with the VA, we are requesting approval to utilize them as a sole source vendor for this follow-on contract.  The estimated contract price is $60,000.


4.  Statutory Authority:  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5, Authorized or required by statute is being cited.  Specifically, Sections 502 and 503 of Public Law (P.L.) 109-461, the Veterans Benefits, Health Care and Information Technology Act of 2006, currently implemented by Office of Acquisition and Logistics Information Letter (IL) 049-07-8, the Veterans First Contracting Program.


5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  The contractor, FourFront Design, Inc., is a service disabled veteran owned business (SDVOSB).  They have successfully completed numerous A/E contracts at this medical center in the last 3 years.  Most of these projects were completed utilizing an IDIQ contract.  At this time, the IDIQ contract has expired, so we are seeking approval to use FourFront as a sole source vendor for this follow-on contract.  Use of any other contractor would cause a substantial duplication in cost to the Government.


6. Sources Solicited:  FourFront Design was responsible for all design work on this project, and is the only logical choice to perform A/E construction period services.  Therefore, no further sources were solicited and a sole source justification will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities.


7.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  In accordance with FAR Part 7, and buyers knowledge, a minimal Market Survey was accomplished. 


8. Market Research Conducted: None


9. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:  A/E services are awarded on the basis of qualifications, not price.  No other firm would likely be competitive on a qualifications basis, relative to the firm that performed the design.


 
10.  Actions to remove Barriers to Competition:  None

11.  Fair and Reasonable Price:  Pricing for previous work performed by this contractor has always been in line with the Government estimates.  We anticipate negotiations with this contractor to result in a fair and reasonable price, as determined by the prepared Government estimate, as well as the prevailing costs for A/E services. 


12.  Contracting Officer's Certification:  Based upon the information provided herein, I believe the justification for awarding this project to FourFront Design, Inc. on a sole-source basis is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and recommend we proceed as such.
