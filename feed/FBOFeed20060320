<CONTACT>Harmony Smith Purchasing Agent 5097540205     hsmith@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Ephrata Field Office, has a requirement for test well drilling.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format at FAR12.6, as supplemented in accordance with the format included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the solicitation.  The Request for Quotes (RFQ) is being issued as 06SQ1U5222; and proposals (including the completed Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items) are due COB March 22, 2006.  The RFQ incorporates revisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-7.  This is a total small business set- aside.  The NAICS code is 237110, the small business standard is $12,000,000.00 dollars. The Bureau of reclamation is in need of test well drilling services.  The general requirements are as follows; Description of the Work - The principal components of the work to be performed under this request include the following: drill one test well and two observation wells; sample water bearing zones for gradation analysis; furnish and install well screen in test well/PVC slotted pipe in observation wells; develop test well with surge block or airlift/surging and pumping; and disinfect wells. All work on the well shall meet the Minimum Standards for Construction and Maintenance of Wells, Chapter 173-160 WAC.  The contractor shall comply with the Department of Ecology rules and regulations governing the regulation and licensing of well contractors and operators for the State of Washington.   The contractor is urged to visit the site of the well and by their own investigation, satisfy themselves as to the existing site conditions.  The contractor shall assume all responsibility for deductions and conclusions as to equipment or materials required and as to the difficulties in performing the work. Test Well Specifications Size and Depth - The well shall be 12-inch diameter and shall be drilled approximately 3 feet into the top of bedrock, or a depth of about 50 feet. Alignment - The drill hole and installed casing shall not deviate from an alignment that would allow a 20-foot dummy section of pipe of 6-inch diameter to be inserted to the bottom of the well without binding.  If the well is not reasonably straight, or the contractor voluntarily stops work before the well is completed, it will be considered an abandoned well.  The contractor, at his expense, shall withdraw the casing from an abandoned well and fill the bore hole with cement grout or bentonite as the casing is being withdrawn.  No payment will be made for any work performed on an abandoned well.  In the event a well is abandoned, a new well shall be started in the immediate vicinity at a location designated by Reclamation's representative on site. Measurement and payment - The well will be measured for payment from the original ground surface to the bottom of the drilled hole.  Payment for drilling the well will be made at the unit price per linear foot offered in the schedule, which price shall include all costs of operating the drilling equipment, all costs of disposing of excavated materials, all costs of furnishing and disposing of drilling water, all costs of disinfecting the well, and all costs of furnishing required data, samples and reports.  Well Casing General - All permanent casing shall be new seamless or welded steel pipe and shall be in accordance with A.P.I. Standard No. 5L of the American Petroleum Institute, except that mill reject pipe may be used.  Each piece of casing shall be stamped, stenciled, or otherwise marked to properly identify the pipe.  The sections of casing shall be joined by welding. Temporary surface casing and surface seal - Temporary surface casing shall be installed to a minimum depth of 18 feet.  Surface casing shall be a minimum 16-inch nominal diameter.  Upon completion of all drilling, development, and other work at the well site, the temporary surface casing shall be removed and shall remain the property of the contractor.  The annular space between the drilled hole and the well casing shall be filled with granular bentonite or cement grout from the bottom of the temporary casing to 5-feet below the ground surface.  The remainder of the annular space shall be filled with gravel to allow installation of a pitless adaptor. Permanent well casing - The permanent well casing shall be 12-inches inside diameter.  The casing shall have a wall thickness of not less than 0.375 inch. The permanent well casing shall be centered within the temporary surface casing and shall be installed to the bottom of the drilled hole, to facilitate the installation of the well screen.  After the screen has been installed, the casing shall be pulled back to expose the screen and the excess length shall be cut off at a point 2 feet above ground surface.  After the well has been completed and tested, the top of the casing shall be covered with a steel plate cap tack-welded to the casing to protect the well until the pumping unit is installed.  Measurement and Payment - Measurement for payment for casing will be made to the nearest 0.5 foot along the centerline of the casing.  Such measurement shall include only the casing installed. Payment for furnishing, installing, and removing temporary surface casing will be made at the lump sum price offered in the schedule, which shall include all costs of furnishing, hauling, handling, welding, and installing the casing and the cost of removing the casing and installing the surface seal (grouting around the top of the permanent well casing). Payment for furnishing and installing permanent well casing will be included in the unit price per linear foot offered in the schedule for well drilling.  The unit price offered in the schedule shall include all costs of furnishing, hauling, handling, welding and installing the casing, the cost of pulling back the casing to expose the well screen and furnishing and installing the steel plate cap. Well Screen Assembly General - the well screen assembly shall consist of a short riser pipe above the well screen and a 1-foot long casing section below the screen.  Positioning of the screen assembly may require that the contractor backfill the hole with clean pea-gravel to the directed depth. The riser pipe and sump may be mild steel or stainless steel.  Neoprene seals shall be installed between the permanent well casing and the screen assembly.  The bottom of the screen assembly shall be closed with a bottom seal.  At the option of the contractor, the bottom seal may be a steel plate welded to the bottom of the assembly or a standard self-closing bottom fitting.  Well screen - The well screen for the screen assembly shall be 10 feet long, 12-inch diameter telescoping-size screen.  The screen shall be type 304 stainless steel, continuous-slot, wire-wound, all-welded construction. The slot openings on the screen will be dependent upon conditions encountered during drilling but will generally range between No. 20 and No. 80 and will be standard screen slot sizes.  One or more slot sizes may be required for an individual screen assembly.  The Reclamation representative shall determine the screen slot size. Measurement and payment - Measurement for the well screen assembly will be made to the nearest 0.5 of a foot along the centering of the assembly without allowance for lap at joints.  Such measurement shall include only the sections installed.  Payment for furnishing and installing the screen assembly will be made at the unit price offered on the schedule for well screen.  The unit price offered in the schedule shall include all costs of furnishing, hauling, handling, welding, and installing the screen assembly, and all costs of furnishing and installing the seals, and pea-gravel backfill. Well Development The well shall be developed by surging with a tight-fitting vented surge block or by airlift surging and pumping to adequately develop the aquifer.  The well will be developed until the water is clear, or a maximum of 8 hours. If the air development method is used, the compressors, airlines, hoses, fittings, etc. shall be of adequate size to pump the well by the airlift at 1-1/2 to 2 times the design capacity of the well.  The contractor shall initially pump the well with air until the well yields clear, sand-free water.  The contractor shall then shut off the air and allow water in the well to return to a near static condition.  He shall then reopen the valve and reintroduce air into the well until water is again brought to the surface at which time he will close the air valve and allow the water to drop back down the well.  He shall repeat this lifting and dropping of the column of water until the well no longer produces fine material when it is surged and pumped.  The bottom of the air line shall be placed at different levels in order to facilitate development of all intake areas and the process repeated until all zones yield water free of turbidity when surged and backwashed.  Upon completion of the development work the well shall be cleaned to the bottom. Measurement and payment - Measurement for payment will be made on the basis of the actual number of hours used in developing the well.  Payment will be made at the unit price per hour offered in the schedule for developing wells, which price shall include the costs of all materials, labor, and equipment required for developing the well, for bailing the accumulated sediment during development, and disposal of water from the development operations. Standby time and Authorized Hourly Work It is anticipated that the work will be planned and coordinated to minimize standby time.  However, standby time may be required after the contractor has furnished formation samples, as provided below.  The rig will be idle while the samples are in the laboratory for grain-size analysis.  No payment will be made for standby time for performing any maintenance or repairs to the equipment or tools on site.  Payment for standby time shall be made at the unit price offered in the schedule. Observation Well Specifications Size and Depth - Temporary surface casing for the observation wells shall be 6-inch diameter and the boreholes shall be drilled approximately 3 feet into the top of bedrock, or a depth of about 50 feet.  Formation samples will be required during advancement of the observation holes, as provided below.   PVC Slotted Pipe and Riser - Upon completion of drilling, 2-inch diameter, Schedule 40 PVC pipe shall be installed to the bottom of the drilled hole.  The bottom 10 feet of PVC pipe shall be slotted, 0.020-inch slot size, and blank riser pipe shall extend above the slotted section to approximately 2-feet above ground surface.   Surface Seal - After installation of the PVC pipe, the temporary surface casing shall be withdrawn to 18 feet depth, measured from ground surface, to allow the formation to backfill around the slotted pipe.  The annular space between the drilled hole and the PVC pipe shall be filled with granular bentonite or cement grout from 18-foot depth to ground surface as the temporary surface casing is withdrawn from the well.   A short section of steel protective casing shall be installed around the 2-inch PVC to a depth of at least 2 feet and shall be fitted with a lockable cap.  Formation Samples The contractor shall furnish 1-quart representative samples of the sediments encountered in each well.  Sampling shall begin at a depth of 10 feet or where directed by the Reclamation representative and shall be taken at 5-foot intervals or at significant changes in strata to the bottom of the well.  The contractor shall furnish a devise for collecting samples which will ensure that all grain sizes are represented. Samples shall be placed in containers (e.g. 1 gallon zip-lock plastic bags) and each container shall be clearly and accurately marked to indicate the depth interval which the sample represents, the date and time it was obtained, and the initials of the individual who obtained the sample.  The samples shall be given to the Reclamation representative for shipment to the soils laboratory for gradational analyses. The cost of performing all work and furnishing all materials described in this paragraph shall be included in the price offered in the schedule for drilling the well. Well Disinfection The contractor shall disinfect the well in accordance with the latest provisions of WAC 173-160-365.  The cost of well disinfection shall be included in the price offered in the schedule for drilling the well. Records The contractor shall furnish complete and accurate drilling records and a detailed well log at the completion of the well.

<DESC>AIRCRAFT DEPOT MAINTENANCE, SITE SUPPORT, AND ENGINE DEPOT FOR THE C-9B/DC-9 SERIES AIRCRAFT, POC Contract Specialist, Jason Lev (301) 757-5927.  Contracting Officer, Anthony J. DeVico.  E-Mail:  jason.lev@navy.mil and anthony.devico@navy.mil respectively.  In support of the Multi-Mission Aircraft Program, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has a requirement for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the Navy’s nineteen C-9 (17 C9B and 2 DC9), and the USAF’s three C-9 aircraft.    There are three distinct efforts to be procured under the following three contracts, Site Support, Airframe Depot, and Engine Depot: 

(a)   The site support effort consists of issuing parts and materials, assembling kits, receiving items for repair or overhaul, and providing replenishing inventory at each on-site storeroom (Incumbent Contractor, L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace LLC, 555 Industrial Drive South, Madison MS 39110-9073, N00019-00-D-0278).  Site support will be at Atlanta NAS, Norfolk NAS, Whidbey Island NAS, Willow Grove NAS, Cherry Point MCAS, and Scott AFB.

(b) Airframe depot maintenance services (SDLMs, PDMs, MTIs) for the Navy and the  USAF necessary to meet C-9 aircraft operational requirements .  Also included will be unscheduled maintenance/drop ins and field team maintenance that occurs away from the Contractor’s designated depot facility, via Contractor Field Teams or Contractor selected Subcontractors and Vendors (Incumbent Contractor, Lockheed Martin Aircraft Center, 244 Terminal Road, Greenville SC 29605, N00019-00-D-0279).  

(c) Engine depot services for the Navy and USAF of Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines such as scheduled and unscheduled engine shop visits.  Also included is field team support for repairs away from the depot facility. Engine support may also include a small number of T-43A engines for the USAF, as well (Incumbent Contractor, Aerothrust Corporation, PO Box 522236 Miami FL 33152, N00019-00-D-0419).  

In order to provide the Government sufficient time to solicite and award the C-9 CLS competition (RFP N00019-05-R-0044), an extension to the existing three current contracts is required.  This is a notice of intent to request proposals and negotiate with L-3 Communications, Lockheed Martin, and Aerothrust Corporation on an other than full and open competitive basis.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with each contractor on their respective contracts. The applicable NAICS code is 488190 with a small business size standard of $6,000,000.00.  The proposed action will result in three modifications to existing firm fixed priced with T&M rates and cost reimbursement material contracts with ordering periods anticipated to be from 01 Oct 2006 through 31 March 2007.  These three contract extensions are to support a delay in anticipated contract award of RFP (N00019-05-R-0044) for the combined C-9 CLS effort currently posted on the NAVAIR Homepage under: http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/solicitation_view_action.cfm?Sol_No=N00019-05-R-0044.   No solicitations will be issued for these three contract extensions.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  Note 22 applies.

<CONTACT>Robert Mohn, Contracting Officer, 412-386-4963, mohn@netl.doe.gov;Robert Mohn, Contract Specialist, 412-386-4963, mohn@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>SUBJECT:   Q50 THERMOGRAVIMETRIC ANALYZER WITH MASS FLOW CONTROL DESC:  The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to TA Instruments â€“ Waters LLC, New Castle, DE 19720 for the purchase for the purchase of a Thermogravimetric Analyzer with Mass Flow Control, the following additional items listed below.  The following specifications are required: 1.  Q50 Thermogravimetric Analyzer with Mass Flow Control:  Features should include a dual range microbalance (0-200 mg and 0-1 gram ranges respectively) with autoswitching between the ranges using a vertical balance design with a horizontal gas purge.  Features should include automated pan loading and furnace movement, plus software controlled, dual, mass flow controllers with automated gas switching.  Up to 500 microliter pan sizes are required.  The module should include Advantage software for complete experimental control of all Q Series and 2XX0 thermal modules in a Windows XP or 2000 Professional environment.  The software should support Unicode, and include a choice of English, German, Japanese and Chinese languages.  It should have extensive setup templates and wizards, on-line help menus with diagnostics and multimedia support, plus Universal Analysis 2000.  Other features should include real time data analysis , autoanalysis, ability to create up to 20 simultaneous curve overlay plot, a customer report generator using Microsoft Word and Excel templates, spreadsheet text files, PCX and HPGL graphics files, and ability to export ASCII data files.  The operating and data analysis software would be unkeyed and able to be installed on Windows 2000 or XP compatible computers with CD-ROM drives â€“ 1 each. 2.  Evolved Gas Analysis (EGA) Furnace for Q series TGA.  Specially designed furnace for evolved gas testing with FT-IR, MS and GC.  Furnace windings should be outside the quartz furnace tube to prevent off gases from reacting with the furnace windings.  The quartz furnace tube should be a reduced volume of about 20 mL to prevent the dilution of the off gas concentration thus providing ultra high sensitivity for detection of the evolved gases.  Connection required to connect with a standard 1/8 inch Swag-lok fitting â€“ 1 each. 3.  Kit Ethernet Switch for communication between a Q Series module and an external controller â€“ 1 each. 4.  Installation & Training:  Installation shall be provided according to ISO 9000 procedure. GENERAL NOTES:  System described above requires a computer/controller which meets the minimu8m specifications, as described in TA Instruments Installation Requirements for Thermal Analysis/Rheology Systems. This purchase order is being issued to TA Instrument â€“ Waters LLC because this is a replacement for an existing unit in our laboratory.  (1)  All of our existing TGA instrumentation is from TA Instruments.  The Q50 is the latest generation of hardware, which is directly compatible and uses common components (balance) as our existing instrumentation.  In addition, the Q50 uses a common software platform as our existing instruments both for data acquisition and data analysis.  We anticipate the need to directly compare data generated on our existing instruments with that generated on the new TGA.  This can only be accomplished directly by adding the TA Instruments hardware.  In addition, our laboratory personnel are currently trained to operate both the TA Instruments hardware and software, so no additional training will be required. Finally, the TA Instruments Q50 TGA uses the same balance mechanism and thermocouples as our existing units, which allows for interchangeability of components if necessary. 1) In addition to the hardware/software compatibility issues, the Q50 TGA from TA Instruments includes some proprietary features which are either highly desirable or integral to our laboratory.  These include: a)  A proprietary pan-loading mechanism by which the user is not required to manually load the sample into the instrument.  This dramatically simplifies the loading process, and protects against damage to the instrument which may be caused by incorrect sample loading.  Competitive instruments require manual insertion of the sample which can lead to excessive wear and/or damage to the instrument. b) Integrated dual-digital mass-flow controllers, which allow for the automated control and datalogging of purge gas streams which are vitally important to our catalyst research.  Competitive instruments required an external gas controlling accessory which adds cost, and does not datalog the purge flow rate. c) A small-volume, quartz lined furnace which protects against corrosion. Our catalysis experiments produce potentially corrosive off-gas which can be damaging to typical ceramic furnaces employed in competitive instrumentation. In addition, ceramic furnaces are porous and can desorb reactive gas introduced in prior experiments, creating the possibility of an experimental â€œmemoryâ€ effect. 3)  In addition to these unique features TA Instruments is the worldâ€™s market share leader, with over a 50% market share, in both Thermal Analysis and Rheology.  TA Instruments also maintains the market leading position in customer support and satisfaction (as measured by independent customer surveys).  TA Instruments is very well positioned to provide the highest quality of product, service and support to Parsons and NETL.  They have Technical and Service Support staff located within 3 hours drive of Morgantown and guarantees 24 hour response times for technical support. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  All interested firms must respond to DE-RQ26-06NT00155.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability. Therefore, no solicitation will result with this announcement.  This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) is 334516.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770.  The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Ms. Carolyn Britton, Phone 304-285-4734.  All bids, proposals, or quotations must be submitted by 5:00 PM Eastern Time, April 3, 2006.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 5 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

1.  Agency Identification:  This is a Justification and Approval for the i2 Inc. purchase of ONA support equipment (Analyst’s notebook/workstation/iBase Designer) for USNORTHCOM Standing Joint Force Headquarters-North (SJFHQ-N), Peterson AFB, CO 80914, in support of Homeland Defense and Defense Support to Civil Authorities.  21 CONS/LGCBA will be the purchasing agency.

2.  Nature and Description of the Action Being Approved:  The purpose of this purchase is to complete the ONA hardware/software requirements for USNORTHCOM.  These items complete the hardware and software requirements that will provide the USNORTHCOM Commander with the capability to accomplish ONA, a critical piece of the Homeland Defense and Defense Support to Civil Authorities missions.  Essentially ONA is an efficient, proactive system that gets inside an enemy's decision cycle and gives decision makers – either political or military – a roadmap on how to potentially “motivate” the enemy to change his ways. ONA provides, the understanding of the system/systems being evaluated and the relationships, dependencies, strengths and vulnerabilities, and it provides the Commander with a potential effect and a range of options for consideration. The estimated amount of this acquisition is .  

3. Description of the Supplies or Services:  The items required are
a.   i2 Analyst’s Workstation 2 Designer plus 1 year support
b.   i2 Analyst’s Workstation 2 plus 1 year supports
c.   i2 TextChart plus 1 year support
d.   i2 Analyst’s Workstation Closed Class CONUS
e.   i2 IBased Closed Class CONUS
f.   i2 Analyst’s Notebook Level 1 Closed Class CONUS training
g.  5 Analyst’s Notebooks and 1 year of support 

4.  Statutory Authority:  The proposed acquisition is being accomplished under the authority of 10 U.S.C., 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(c), Only one responsible source.

5.  Unique Qualifications:  

a.  i2 Inc. products are used by USNORTHCOM and Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) across DoD.  It is the standard for DoD for conducting ONA and lens support to the broader DoD mission of Effects Based Planning (planning of military operations based on achieving a desired effect as a result of ONA).  Effects Based Planning is a quicker, more focused decision making process.  It is not practical to consider other options as the the impact of changing the current standard would need to be measured and tested across DoD prior to implementation.  It would undoubtedly incur duplication of cost, and could cause interoperability between JFCOM and the other Combatant Commanders.    

b.  i2 Inc. is the exclusive distributor of the ONA products.  They are the publisher, holder of all copyrights, and the sole source for the hardware, software, maintenance, and support. The hardware provided by i2 Inc is unique and along with the software are protected by trade secrets and are unique in the market.

<DESC>Description
1.     The 12th Contracting Squadron, Randolph AFB TX, has a requirement to Modify Interphone Audio Control Panale Simulator and Audio Control Boards with the attached Statement of Work (SOW).     This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This solicitation is issued as request for quotation (RFQ) number FA3089-06-T-0016.     This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.     The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the government.     Award is contingent upon availability of funds. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 336413; size standard 1,000 employees.

2.     The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, are applicable to this solicitation.     Interested parties may submit a written quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1 and the attached CLIN structure.     Oral quotes will not be accepted.     Your quote should include your Cage Code, DUNS, and Tax Identification numbers.     To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this RFQ, contractors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, no exceptions.     To register, please visit http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.     Contractors must complete the Representations and Certifications in the ORCA database at http://www.bpn.gov/orca.       

3.     FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     Addendum:     Basis for Award:     This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures.     For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.     Offers shall propose on all items.     Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.     An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.     Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 

4.     The evaluation process will proceed as follows:     (a) Technical Acceptance:     By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions, statement of work, and all other requirements of this solicitation and subsequent contract, and will be determined technically acceptable.     Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:     Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price.     Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.     Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished    c) Past Performance:   Using questionnaires, the contracting officer will seek relevant and recent performance information on all technically acceptable offers based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Recency:     To be considered recent, a contract shall have been performed during the past three years from the date of issuance of this posting.     Relevancy:     Relevant performance includes performance of work efforts that is similar or greater in scope and magnitude.     The following varying degrees of relevancy apply to this solicitation: Very Relevant	Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.  Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references, but no more than 5 overall of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers.     The offeror shall provide the attached past performance questionnaire to the reference and bear responsibility for ensuring that the reference provides the completed questionnaire to the point of contact identified in paragraph 11 of this posting by the deadline for offer submission.     Questionnaires submitted prior to the deadline for offer submission will be accepted.     The reference list should include, as a minimum: Contract Number, Description of Contract/Project Effort, Period of Performance, Contract Dollar Value, Name, Title, Current Address and Telephone Number of Contracting Officer and Quality Assurance Evaluator/Project Manager.
 
5.     The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     The agency will evaluate past performance in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs 4(c) through 8 of this solicitation.     The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.     The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     A trade-off process is then conducted.     The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.     A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror is received.     In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.     

6.     Overall confidence ratings are defined as follows: High Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has high confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Significant Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable. Little Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

7.     Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.     Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive a neutral rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.     However, a rating other than neutral may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts, or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts.     When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).     Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.     The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.     The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond. 

8.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and realistic, and is judged to have an overall high performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.     Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated high confidence in the performance assessment, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated high confidence overall for past performance.     An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.     If no proposals are rated high confidence in the performance assessments, an integrated analysis will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.

9.     The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of very good or lower.     (2) If discussions will be conducted, all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.     The contracting officer will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.     The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest price offeror if that lowest priced offeror.     The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.     Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.     The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.       

10.     The following clauses and provisions are applicable to this solicitation:     FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, FAR 52.219-1 Alt 1, Small Business Program Representations, FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, Addendum: Para (c) Changes is tailored as follows:     The contracting officer may modify the contract unilaterally under the following circumstances:     (a) to make administrative changes that do not affect the price or substantive terms; (b) to issue change orders or directions; or (c) to make changes authorized by clauses other than a changes clause, including but not limited to the Property clause, or Suspension of Work Clause.

This is a broad, community-specific market survey to locate sources for supply of numerous avionics items that are currently in short supply within the Army and are needed immediatel y to support Army Aviation. In many cases, OEM suppliers are unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our current needs. Thus, we are interested in buying assets from alternative sources. Depending upon specific circumstances for the items in questi on, we might be interested in buying new stock, new old stock, reconditioned items, or, in some cases, unserviceable items. In some cases, this material may have been purchased by suppliers as surplus equipment.  Depending upon respondents capabilities an d the current status of our organic depot repair programs, we might be interested in having the supplier perform refurbishment / repair-overhaul. Alternatively, we might want to buy the unserviceable assets and induct these into ongoing organic repair prog rams that are operating below capacity because of the longstanding paucity of unserviceable returns from the field.  Regardless of specific circumstances, any company that possesses ANY significant quantity of Army avionics is encouraged to respond with in formation regarding those assets that they have available. We have a list of key NSNs of interest that will be provided via e-mail upon request. We are looking for hardware assets, not repair services. Companies capable of performing this effort may respon d by writing to: Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N-AN (MICHAEL E. HARRIS), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5403 or alternatively, contact us via e-mail at: EMAIL ADDRESS: avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.

<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison 301-227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), Code 6301, Radiation Technology Group has a requirement for Geiger-Muller (GM) tubes to replace old GM tubes in Navy’s Multi Function RADIAC (MFR) Control units and Gamma-Beta probes and intends to award a Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to be awarded for five years to Canberra Industries, Meriden, CT. This acquisition is made under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The small business set-aside has been dissolved. NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement under the authority of  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplier of services will satisfy agency requirements. The GM tube is an integral part of the MFR, which determines its functionality and characteristics. The MFR, currently fielded by the Navy, contains GM tubes manufactured by EURISYS MESURES, part of COGEMA group, which also owns CANBERRA INDUSTRIES. This tube was marketed commercially by EURISYS MESURES as part number 3G6500 and is defined by Navy Specification Control Drawing no. 6962729 Rev. D. These tubes, under controlled condition, have an average life of five years. The Navy fielded the MFR in 1999/2000 and intends to keep it in the field for another seven to ten years. Thus, failed GM tubes have to be replaced by tubes, which are identical to it with respect to form, function and fit. Gas mixture, which determines the characteristics of a GM tube, is proprietary information of the manufacturer. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Anticipated award date is on or around 4/20/06. Interested parties may forward capabilities statements to the POC (hugh.harrison@navy.mil) no later than 4/04/2006.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD intends to procure eleven (11) Digital Control System with Internal ACM, along with additional cable kits, video auto-tracking options, and installation kits.    The Government intents to solicit and negotiate with Brashear LP, 615 Epsilon Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15238.  These items are to be procured using a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract, with a base year plus four option years.  The contract should include Freight On Board (f.o.b.) Destination shipping terms.  Deliveries shall commence no later than six (6) months after issuance of delivery order.  The award date is anticipated to be on or before 30 April 2006.  Delivery will be to the Receiving Officer, Supply Department, Bldg. 665, 47179 Vaughn Road, (NASSU), Patuxent River, MD 20670.  Inspection and Acceptance shall be at destination.  The contractor shall extend to the Government, full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale.  Acceptance of the warranty does not waive the Government's rights under the Inspection clause, nor does it limit the Government's rights with regard to the terms and conditions of this contract.  In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract will take precedence over the warranty.  The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverable listed in the schedule.  

This is not a request for competitive proposals.  The government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Brashear because the company is the original manufacturer of all cinetheodolites, as well as the KTM tracking mounts, currently used by ATR.  They are the only known company that has successfully integrated a digital controller unit to the cinetheodolite, and have demonstrated it to work properly with the current system, thus meeting the Government’s minimum requirements.  Installation is to take place at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Atlantic Test Range facility, Patuxent River, Maryland.  

All interested parties may submit a capabilities statement, which shall be considered by the agency for equal items.  All capabilities statements received by 2:30 pm Eastern Standard Time, April 7, 2006, will be considered by the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to initiate a competitive procurement.  Technical capability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this provision.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the interested parties to provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the capabilities of the alternate equipment.  Inquiries/responses to this notice should include company name, point of contact, address, area code and telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address.  The government will not pay for any technical information received.  

All inquiries regarding this notice must be addressed, in writing, to the attention of Mr. Kenneth Pirko at kenneth.pirko@navy.mil, or faxed to Mr. Pirko at (301) 757-0200.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is soliciting offers for a contract to study the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) chemical disposition in mammals. The purpose of the project is to obtain detailed chemical disposition data from 3 to 6 studies of selected environmental contaminants or model compounds per year. Most of these studies will be required in laboratory rats (Fischer 344) and/or mice (B6C3F1); however, some studies may require other laboratory animals (other rodent species or dogs).  Most of the studies will address the disposition of organic chemicals or environmental contaminants; however, studies of inorganic chemicals may also be requested.  Individual studies may vary in complexity from preliminary investigations of chemical absorption to detailed studies of all phases of chemical disposition, toxicokinetics, and metabolism.  The immediate goal of these studies is to determine more accurately the doses for National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassay studies.  The long range goal is the accumulation of data that will permit a better assessment of structure-activity for chemical absorption, metabolism and disposition in laboratory animals and to better interpret the significance of these data to man.  A study shall consist of the determination of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a selected compound in a given species. Identification of unknown metabolites may be complex enough to be considered a separate study.  Estimation of toxicokinetic parameters may be requested for selected chemicals.  One or more studies per year may be requested to investigate the comparative metabolism of chemicals in human and rat liver microsomes or hepatocytes in vitro. The compounds for study shall be selected and provided by the Project Officer.  Unless a satisfactory analytical procedure is available for unlabeled compounds and both parties agree to its use, radio labeled compounds shall be provided to facilitate the assay.  In most instances, the initial studies shall be performed in male rats; however, the Project Officer shall reserve the right to require studies in female rats or additional species.  Male animals are studied initially to avoid the influence of estrogenic hormones on xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes.  The protocol for the study shall be developed by the Principal Investigator in cooperation with the Project Officer.  The government estimates that the project will require the work of 2 professional man-years and 3 technical/administrative personnel man-years in each contract year.  The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator shall have a minimum of 5 years Post-Doctoral Degree experience.  The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator shall demonstrate experience in specific areas by manuscripts or publications as described in the evaluation criteria.  The estimated annual level of effort is 9,980 labor hours.  Award of two cost-reimbursement, level of effort contracts (the work on the contract involves continuous activity with no clearly defined end point) on an open competition basis is contemplated as a result of this solicitation.  The contracts obtained under this solicitation will continue the work of two similar contracts.  The period of performance for the contract is five years, beginning on or about March 1, 2007 through February 28, 2012.  Five (5) one-year options extending the performance of the contract beyond the fifth base year are planned.  Should a study using dogs be initiated it will be included as an option.  Interested organizations should fax a request for RFP NIH-ES-06-01 to the attention of Mr. David Sedgley, Contract Specialist at (919) 541-2712 or send an e-mail request to sedgley@niehs.nih.gov.  Information regarding this solicitation with instructions for submission of proposals and evaluation criteria will be available on the Internet at:  http://www.niehs.nih.gov/dert/rcb/rfp.htm.  An electronic copy of the RFP (without the attachments) will be posted to this site on or about April 6, 2006.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Expected release date of the RFP is April 6, 2006 with proposals due May 24, 2006.  This requirement is unrestricted.  NAICS Code is 541710.

<DESC>The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, plans to solicit proposals for a multi-site (up to three sites) clinical trial to evaluate the effect of daily low-dose aspirin on all phases of reproduction beginning at preconception and continuing throughout pregnancy, including implantation and live births.  The objectives of this study are to:

(1)	determine the effect of low-dose aspirin in combination with folic acid on the incidence of live births among those with HCG detected pregnancy relative to folic acid alone; 
(2)	determine the effect of low-dose aspirin in combination with folic acid treatment on incidence of HCG detected pregnancy relative to folic acid alone;
(3)	determine the effect of low-dose aspirin in combination with folic acid treatment on early loss of pregnancy (ELP) relative to folic acid alone;
(4)	determine the effect of low-dose aspirin in combination with folic acid treatment on pregnancy outcomes relative to folic acid alone;
(5)	determine the effect of low-dose aspirin in combination with folic acid treatment on intermediate outcomes including endometrial thickness and cord arterial blood flow;
(6)	create a repository of urine and serum samples for future evaluation; and
(7)	investigate the validity of self-reported aspirin use by comparison with laboratory measured aspirin metabolites.

In addition to the primary study noted above, offerors may also propose to provide central laboratory services for all of the clinical sites participating in the study.  Only one of the clinical sites will be selected to provide the central laboratory services. 
 
It is anticipated that three five-year, cost-reimbursement type contracts will be awarded, with awards made on or about September 30, 2006.  The solicitation will be issued on or about April 5, 2006, and will be posted on this Web site.  Offerors are responsible for routinely checking this Web site for any amendments to the solicitation.

<DESC>Description
1.     The 12th Contracting Squadron, Randolph AFB TX, has a requirement to Build three Frames to support three Fuselages for a KC135 BOWST Trainer in accordance with attached Statement of Work and drawings.(Additional drawings available upon request.)     This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This solicitation is issued as request for quotation (RFQ) number F3P3BD6004A100.     This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.     The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the government.     Award is contingent upon availability of funds. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 238130; size standard $12,000,000.

2.     The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, are applicable to this solicitation.     Interested parties may submit a written quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1 and the attached CLIN structure.     Oral quotes will not be accepted.     Your quote should include your Cage Code, DUNS, and Tax Identification numbers.     To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this RFQ, contractors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, no exceptions.     To register, please visit http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.     Contractors must complete the Representations and Certifications in the ORCA database at http://www.bpn.gov/orca.       

3.     FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     Addendum:     Basis for Award:     This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures.     For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.     Offers shall propose on all items.     Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.     An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.     Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 

4.     The evaluation process will proceed as follows:     (a) Technical Acceptance:     By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions, statement of work, and all other requirements of this solicitation and subsequent contract, and will be determined technically acceptable.     Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:     Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price.     Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.     Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished    c) Past Performance:   Using questionnaires, the contracting officer will seek relevant and recent performance information on all technically acceptable offers based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Recency:     To be considered recent, a contract shall have been performed during the past three years from the date of issuance of this posting.     Relevancy:     Relevant performance includes performance of work efforts that is similar or greater in scope and magnitude.     The following varying degrees of relevancy apply to this solicitation: Very Relevant	Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.  Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references, but no more than 5 overall of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers.     The offeror shall provide the attached past performance questionnaire to the reference and bear responsibility for ensuring that the reference provides the completed questionnaire to the point of contact identified in paragraph 11 of this posting by the deadline for offer submission.     Questionnaires submitted prior to the deadline for offer submission will be accepted.     The reference list should include, as a minimum: Contract Number, Description of Contract/Project Effort, Period of Performance, Contract Dollar Value, Name, Title, Current Address and Telephone Number of Contracting Officer and Quality Assurance Evaluator/Project Manager.
 
5.     The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     The agency will evaluate past performance in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs 4(c) through 8 of this solicitation.     The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.     The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     A trade-off process is then conducted.     The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.     A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror is received.     In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.     

6.     Overall confidence ratings are defined as follows: High Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has high confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Significant Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable. Little Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

7.     Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.     Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive a neutral rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.     However, a rating other than neutral may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts, or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts.     When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).     Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.     The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.     The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond. 

8.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and realistic, and is judged to have an overall high performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.     Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated high confidence in the performance assessment, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated high confidence overall for past performance.     An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.     If no proposals are rated high confidence in the performance assessments, an integrated analysis will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.

9.     The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of very good or lower.     (2) If discussions will be conducted, all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.     The contracting officer will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.     The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest price offeror if that lowest priced offeror.     The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.     Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.     The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.       

10.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, intends to issue a solicitation for a Blackwater and Graywater Treatment System for a United States Coast Guard Cutter. This is a fully automated, self-contained treatment system that provides treatment of blackwater and graywater found on the ship which is equipped with blackwater vacuum collection and graywater gravity collection systems. Treatment systems must provide the entire process required to treat incoming wastewater mixture in accordance with this specification. Offerors will be required to submit technical and cost proposals. This will be an unrestricted solicitation and award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. On Tuesday, 04 April 2006 a pre-solicitation site visit will be conducted on board the USCG BLUEBELL located in Portland, Oregon. Since the Coast Guard Cutter is an older ship, complete and accurate configuration drawings showing service interfa!  ces such as electrical, sea water, drains, ship service air, etc. as well as potential integration interferences are not available. The specification has maximum dimensions identified but contractors are invited to propose ways to optimize the space available on the ship based on the type of Marine Sanitation Device the offeror is considering proposing. Offerors are urged and expected to inspect the site and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award. Offerors must contact the contract specialist, Camille Mesquita at camille.mesquita@navy.mil by 24 March 2006 order to register for the site visit and obtain details. The solicitation is expected to be released on or about 10 April 2006. Solicitation packages will only be available electronically and!   no hard copies will be sent. All interested parties may download the  solicitation and any amendments at http://www.neco.navy.mil or http://www.fedbizopps.gov after the release date of the solicitation.

<DESC>(Q.1.) It appears that ARA and their approach has already been selected to develop this system.  What is the realistic expectation that another companys approach will be given the same competitive consideration? (A.1.) Any company that submits a whi tepaper will be given consideration in accordance with note 22 of the original FedBizOpps announcement.  (Q.2.) You indicated that ARA has a proprietary formulation. Has the decision been made to use ARAs formula? (A.2.) The final determination will not be made until the presolicitation notice closes.  (Q.3.) Has a configuration been selected? (A.3.)Configuration has not been selected because it requires several tests. (Q.4.) What are the physical specifications for the system, e.g. size, weight, operational configuration, etc? (A.4.)There are no Government provided physical specifications for the system.  However, several factors are important such as cost, performance,  and non-explosive chemicals.  The cost is a driving force for selecting size and weight.   The final device should not cost more than $2.00 each. (Q.5.) Is this to be classified as a pyrotechnic, explosive device or other type of munitions? (A.5.) The final device will be called an explosive device. This will be a multi-component device, and it will be produced by a mixture of more than two non-expl  osive components just prior to use. (Q.6.) What are the operational parameters, e.g. initiation delay/command detonation, minimum safe radius, time delay, environmental temperature constraints, reliability, storage shelf life, packaging/shipping requirements, etc? (A.6.) The device will neut  ralize landmines and UXO by high-order detonation. The device can be initiated remotely at a stand-off distance up to 300 meters. A time fuse for initiation of the device can be used, but we prefer the initiator be a non-explosive detonator.  For humanita r ian deming purposes environmental constraints such as temperature is not an important factor. The storage shelf life for each component should be at least 10 years.  Each component will need to be able to be handled, stored, and shipped as a non-explosiv e. The requirement for special handling increases the cost of such compositions.      (Q.7.) Does this system have to meet Insensitive Munitions (IM) requirements? (A.7.)Insensitive Munitions (IM) is not required for the system because it will be produced just prior to use.  Once the device is used, it is totally destroyed, leaving nothing to be stored. (Q.8.) Is there a requirement for 'dual safe initiation' and what are the requirements for 'Man Safe' issues? (A.8.) For humanitarian demining purposes, the system or device needs to be safe, easy to transport, easy to use, reliable, and less costly.  Ther e is a no requirement for 'dual safe' initiation.  The important requirements for 'Man Safe' issues are non-explosive and non-toxic chemicals. (Q.9.) How do you define the terms 'all tasks' and 'field ready' from your solicitation What capabilities must be  demonstrated for successful completion of this phase? (A.9.) 'All tasks'-- The various tasks a contractor will perform to derive the final products.  'Field ready'--The contractor will develop prototypes devices from non-explosive ingredients.  These devi ces will be tested against live mines at a government facility. The final prototype device is known as a Field Ready Unit for Humanitarian Demining purposes only.   The final devices will be tested at government site against live unfuzed various type of AP  and AT mines and several UXO. (Q.10.) What are the forecasted eventual procurement quantities and schedule? (A.10.) We develop products (devices) for Humanitarian Demining. We demonstrate various mine detection, clearance and mine neutralization technologies during our annual DoD HD Re  quirements Workshop at a government test facility.  We also provide information for each demonstrated system. If deminers from any country like particular  pr oducts, they will contract directly with the developer or request to the State Department the need of a particular product to test in their countries. The HD team sometimes procures 500 units to test in various countries, if the device is successful at neu tralizing mines.

<DESC>The Seattle District US Army Corps of Engineers requires a new debris boom system at the Chief Joseph Dam project in accordance with the solicitation Statement of Work.   Chief Joseph Dam, at Bridgeport Washington, has a floating boom that acts as a debris barrier, primary and boat barrier, secondary. The existing boom consists of steel floats partially filled with concrete, attached to a submerged steel cable. The existing boom extends to about 30 below water. The existing boom has performed both fu nctions satisfactorily, but has had excessive corrosion problems that have caused floats to lose buoyancy and caused the cable to fray. In addition, the specific wind conditions force a portion of the boom onto the shore, sometimes causing it to break. Thi s project is to design, provide and deliver a new boom. The new boom is to provide the same primary functions as the existing boom, and remedy the corrosion problems and the problem of blowing ashore.  This procurement is to provide all materials and servi ces to design and deliver a new boom to the Chief Joseph Dam project in Bridgeport, Washington.  There is an option for installation.  All work shall be complete by September 30, 2006.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 332313 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Project is open to both large and small business.  Issue of this solicitation will be electronically via emailed PDF file.  Send a request to  scott.w.britt@usace.army.mil to receive the PDF file.  There will be no issue of hard copies or disks.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service is actively working to develop and implement its requirements for its Phase 3 Mail Processing Infrastructure (MPI) program and is seeking sources to pre-qualify for these requirements.  The requirements include pre-installation, installation, and post installation activities necessary for successful structured wiring implementation upgrading of base-band local area network (LAN) wiring at approximately 160 small, medium and large Mail Processing and Distribution Centers (P&DCs); approximately 21 administrative LANs co-located at P&DCs receiving workroom floor upgrades; provide standard MPI documentation in facilitating support of the LANs to provide a uniform approach to troubleshooting and maintaining all local network components.  The purpose of this notice seeking sources to pre-qualify is to afford prospective suppliers the opportunity to submit their request to be considered as a pre-qualified supplier for these requirements. Only those suppliers who wish to be a prime contractor need respond to this announcement.  Pre-qualified suppliers are companies whose record of performance in the marketplace (Postal Service, other government, or commercial) has demonstrated their ability to perform to consistently high standards of quality and reliability.  The pre-qualified suppliers list will remain in effect for a five-year period and will be used for the current Mail Processing Infrastructure Phase 3 requirements and for any additional follow-on requirements deemed appropriate during the five-year period.  The Postal Service may consider additional suppliers for pre-qualification during this five year period based upon their ability to demonstrate a record of performance with consistently high standards of quality and reliability in the marketplace (Postal Service, other government, or commercial).  Any entity seeking pre-qualification after the initial list of pre-qualified suppliers has been established must provide the same prequalification information below.  Suppliers should demonstrate their capability to meet the following qualifications; working knowledge of Federal, state, local and industry electric codes; experience in installation of LAN networks in large 24 hour production facilities (Postal facility experience preferred); minimum of one currently Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) engineer assigned to the MPI Program effort supporting all system design matters; current membership in and Building Industry Consulting Services International  (BICSI) certification; experienced CAD operators; engineering design capabilities to support system design and installation; Microsoft office products computer skills; ability to manage and meet schedule dates at multiple concurrent site installations at diverse locations throughout the country; configuration control management; demonstrated project management capabilities for programs of similar magnitude (Postal experience preferred) and quality to include warranty support and certification which will form the qualified base for the Mail Processing Infrastructure requirements. The United States Postal Service reserves the right not to award, or to award a single or multiple contracts for Mail Processing Infrastructure requirements; the instant Phase 3 requirements are contemplated in resulting in two or more awards to suppliers pre-qualified to participate in the Mail Processing Infrastructure requirements.  Your qualification statement should address each evaluation factor in the order listed below.  For consideration for pre-qualification, the potential supplier must provide the following information for evaluation: 1) Provide the program name(s) for work completed relating to structured wiring implementation upgrading of base-band local area network wiring for which your company was involved and identify the percentage of that effort for which your company was responsible.  For each reference listed provide the company name, contact person, telephone number, contract number and dollar value.  2) Address each of the following evaluation factors:  Technical Capability – Demonstrate the capability of your company to perform as a pre-qualified source for structured wiring upgrading of base-band local area network.  Program Management – Demonstrate the capability of your company to manage a program of this type for which you are seeking pre-qualification.  Past Performance:  Timeliness – Consistent on time delivery and adherence to contract schedules including the administrative aspects of performance.  Quality – documented quality system appropriate for the pre-qualification area including demonstrated quality initiatives, conformance to contract requirements, standards of good workmanship, and reliability of goods and/or services.  Cost Control – A record of forecasting and containing costs.  Supply Chain Management – The management of total material flow from all levels of subcontractors.  Business Relations – A history of being responsible and cooperative with customers; commitment to customer satisfaction; integrity and ethics. To be considered capable the supplier must:  Have the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, technical skills, and production and property controls and either have, or have the ability to obtain, resources (financial, technical, etc.) adequate to perform the work; Have, or have the ability to develop a sound quality control program that complies with the task requirement or the solicitation requirements. Your submission must be in sufficient detail to adequately address each factor and not exceed 15 pages of content not smaller than size 12 font.  Electronic submissions must be in Microsoft file formats.  Include your e-mail address, contact person name and telephone number, company name, and mailing address in your submission.

Description
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of system and subsystem level technologies that enable revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military. The DARPA/TTO program will consider a broad range of technologies but focuses on the high risk/high payoff development and demonstration of complete systems or subsystems rather than advances in basic sciences. Proposed systems and subsystems need not be composed entirely of newly developed components, and may integrate new technology into existing systems and/or subsystems. 

AREAS OF INTEREST: DARPA/TTO priorities fall within two focus areas: Aerospace Systems and Tactical Multipliers. Other novel ideas that enhance military effectiveness and tilt the balance of modern warfare in favor of the US will also be considered. This BAA seeks new ideas, not necessarily extensions of the current programs. 
The range of programs managed by TTO has historically been broad. However, some proposals, particularly for devices, materials, and basic science, may be more appropriate  to one or more of the other DARPA Offices listed at www.darpa.mil. Offerors are encouraged to look at http://www.darpa.mil/TTO for our current activities. At a later date, attachments may be provided which describe areas of special interest to the office; modifications will be published as these attachments are updated during the year. Offerors are encouraged to contact program managers and discuss their ideas and how they relate to TTOs focus areas.

PROGRAM SCOPE: The Government plans to make $8.0M of FY 2006 funds available to fund projects under this BAA, though more may be made available. Multiple awards are anticipated from FY 2006 funds. For Government programmatic flexibility, offerors should segment their cost proposals into an initial 12-month (or shorter) phase which explores and validates the technical feasibility of the concept, and one or more phases proposed as optional efforts leading toward technology development. The total effort including options should not exceed five years. TTO typically provides less than $500K for the initial phase. Successful initial phases will have a greater likelihood of receiving funding for subsequent optional phases.   
OFFERORS: Teaming is encouraged. An offeror may submit more than one proposal. Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in innovative tactical technology. Proposals from US government entities, federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), and other offerors who are proposing additional work under existing task order contracts will not be considered part of this BAA but may be evaluated by TTO separately from the BAA proposals. 

RESPONSES: This BAA solicits both white papers and proposals on proposed research. Prospective offerors are encouraged to contact the Technical POC or other TTO Program Managers to discuss areas of interest prior to submission of white papers or proposals. Offerors are strongly encouraged to submit white papers before submitting proposals. TTO responds to white papers with a recommendation based on the relevance to the TTO mission and a preliminary technical assessment. Regardless of the TTO recommendation based on its review of the white paper, an offeror may submit a proposal and that proposal will be reviewed and evaluated. Favorable response to a white paper is not an assurance that a full proposal on the white paper's topic will ultimately be selected for contract award. 

SCHEDULE: TTO will conduct an initial round of proposal receipt, evaluation, selection, and award. For the initial round of source selection, white papers should be submitted to TTO no later than 5-1-06. In order to be considered for an award during this first round, proposals must be received by TTO no later than 06-15-06. White papers received after 1600 local time 10-15-06 will not be evaluated under this BAA. The BAA will remain open for proposals through 1600 local time on the closing date, 12-31-06. Proposals received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated. TTO will endeavor to respond to each white paper within forty-five (45) days after its receipt. As soon as the evaluation of a proposal is completed, the offeror will be notified that 1) the proposal has been selected for funding pending contract negotiations, or 2) the proposal has not been selected. One copy of each non-selected proposal will be retained for the files. Any additional copies of non-selected proposals will be destroyed upon non-selection. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA: Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a review using the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1) potential contribution to TTO mission; 2) overall scientific and technical merit including degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational issues, and experimental approach; 3) likelihood of transition to the military if technically successful; 4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, including qualifications and achievements of all team members and their key personnel, their capability to carry out further development and production, and the adequacy of facilities and equipment to be used for the proposed effort; 5) project plan; and 6) cost and cost realism. 
All proposals must first be deemed acceptable under criteria (1) to receive a full technical review.

AWARDS: Awards under this BAA will be made to offerors on the basis of the evaluation criteria above and program balance to provide best value to the Government. Awards will be subject to the availability of funds. Award instruments may take the form of a procurement contract, grant, or agreement depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors. Phases after Phase I will be options, with pricing based on the cost proposal. An estimated cost for options beyond Phase I must be included or the options will not be considered. The Government reserves the right to 1) select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received, and 2) incrementally fund any award instrument. 

FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL: The form and format for white papers and proposals follows below. White papers and proposals that do not satisfy these form and format requirements or with differing content between their electronic and paper versions may be rejected without further review or evaluation. All submissions should be in the English language. White papers should be submitted electronically; a paper copy is not required. Proposals should also be submitted electronically but in addition, two paper copies of each proposal, accompanied by a transmittal letter signed by an official who is authorized to commit the offeror should be mailed to the address below. Electronic copies should be in PDF (preferred) or Microsoft Word format and submitted via a web site interface. Submission deadlines apply both to electronic and paper versions. All copies of white papers and proposals should be sent to: Web Site: https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa . Mail: DARPA, TTO, ATTN: BAA 06-15, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714. Proposals received by TTO but not submitted specifically to the BAA may be considered under the BAA. 

WHITE PAPERS: The submission of a white paper is optional, but strongly recommended. A white paper should be a brief summary. It introduces the idea, solicits interaction with TTO, and avoids the expense of generating proposals that have little likelihood of selection within this BAA. White papers should summarize the planned proposal and clearly articulate the innovative concept or technology development being proposed. White papers should contain a cover sheet (clearly marked "White Paper"), a four page (maximum) summary of the technical idea, a one-page cost summary, and a one-paragraph (150-200 words) abstract of the white paper as a whole. All pages should be printable on 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper; type not smaller than 12 point. The page limitations for white papers include all figures, tables, and charts. No formal transmittal letter is required. Receipt will be confirmed. White papers should avoid proprietary or classified information or data not critical to the idea being presented. 

PROPOSALS: Each proposal shall consist of two volumes, Volume I - Technical, and Volume II - Cost. Volume I shall consist of a Cover Sheet, an abstract, and three sections. Volume II shall consist of a Cover Sheet and two sections. All pages shall be printable on 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper with type not smaller than 12 point.

CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS AND ITAR: DARPA/TTO will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. If a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. The point of contact for classified responses is the Director of TTO Security at 703-526-6708. Proposers who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their proposal should contact this POC before submitting a response. Information generated after award may be controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR 120-130, therefore contractors may be required to protect information pursuant to the ITAR and are encouraged to consider this when proposing. 

HUMAN USE IN RESEARCH: Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the Department of Defense Directive 3216.2 (www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects. This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and Federal Wide Assurances. These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during the entire length of the proposed effort. For proposals involving "greater than minimal risk" to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a federally approved IRB at the time of proposal submission to DARPA. For proposals that are forecasted to involve "greater than minimal risk" after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Human Research Protections website (http://www.dhhs.gov/ohrp).

<DESC>Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) Sources Sought <br><br> This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United States Air Force Electronic System Center (ESC), Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Systems Group (ISRSG) to determine potential sources capable of providing technical and engineering support for the Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) program.  Program requirements have changed, and the Government wishes to explore the opportunity to seek competition for future spiral developments. The Government is planning an Industry Day sometime during the month of May 2006. The details will be posted on the Hanscom AFB Electronic Request for Proposals Bulletin Board (HERBB).  Criteria for determining highly qualified firms capable of serving as the prime contractor for IBS are summarized below. <br> <br> The primary objective of the IBS is to deliver Near Real Time (NRT), high priority intelligence to tactical users in a common format.  The Common Message Format (CMF) is an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) based format with two forms; one a binary representation (CMF-B) of the XML message to conserve the limited bandwidth on the UHF  channel, and the other, a fully XML compliant form (CMF-X) for interoperability with current and future Global Information Grid (GIG) systems. <br> <br> Companies are encouraged to respond only if they have a demonstrated ability to 1) develop the new capabilities outlined below, and 2) develop and deploy Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) consistent with the DoD Netcentric vision.  Additionally, companies must have a strong working knowledge of legacy IBS (IBS-I, IBS-N, IBS-S) tactical messaging environment including message formats.  Existing TS/SCI cleared personnel and facilities will be required. <br> <br> The table below summarizes the critical performance parameters for future spiral development: <br> <br> Critical Performance Parameters<br> Proposed solution must be able to concurrently accept CMF reports from producers via Service- or Nationally-provided communications to include: RF, networks, and telephony. <br> Proposed solution must be capable of disseminating CMF reports based on: User generated, regional COCOM controlled and validated dissemination priorities<br> <br> Proposed solution must be able to concurrently disseminate CMF reports via Service- or Nationally- provided communications to include: RF, networks, and telephony<br> Proposed solution must be interoperable: <br> 1)Provide the ability to accept and deliver data in approximately 8 Legacy data formats (e.g., USSID 359 & 369, OILSTOCK, USMTF, TAB-37, TDIMF, etc.) <br> 2)Develop & implement a Netcentric performance capability<br> <br> Message Volume: <br> Proposed solution must process 11.2M messages/day<br> Number of User Profiles: <br> Proposed solution must provide the capability for 500 simultaneous User Profiles each specifying classes of valid User messages and User Priority (i.e., Priority 1-4) <br> Categories of Message Priorities: <br> Proposed solution must support four message priorities with IBS end-to-end timeline requirements: <br> Priority                       Timeline<br> 1	                      <3 seconds<br> 2	                      <5 seconds<br> 3	                      <2 minutes<br> 4                             <30 minute<br> <br> Proposed solution must  have message filtering for each User Profile<br> <br> Companies should summarize their qualifications to perform this type of development, and should cite examples of previous experiences developing software in a spiral approach. <br> <br> Respondents to this Sources Sought should demonstrate skills and proficiency in PKI and in the design of dissemination systems that operate simultaneously at multiple security levels. They should have experience developing and troubleshooting software applications for the intelligence community, and demonstrated the ability to integrate complex systems with a minimum CMMI Level 3 independent assessment. <br> <br> Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought request. The Government requests interested parties submit a statement of their qualifications with respect to the criteria described above.  To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information.  Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure. <br> <br> Interested parties should respond electronically to the email address jeremy.babb@hanscom.af.mil not later than 4:00 PM (EST) 4 April 2006 to inform the Government of their interest.  Electronically submitted material, in addition to a statement of interest should not exceed five (5), one-sided, 8.5X 11 inch pages, with the font no smaller than 10 point.  Please use the critical performance parameters as a guide in determining your interest and/or level of electronic response. <br> <br> Please direct any question on this announcement to Captain Jeremy Babb, Contracting Office, (781)-266-1037. <br> <br>  See Note 26.

<DESC>On September 30, 2003, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center (PSC) awarded a nine-year contract for the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to MDRC located in New York, NY (Contract #233-03-0034).  The contract is for an Evaluation of Interventions to Strengthen Marriages of Low-Income Couples, the Supporting Healthy Marriage project.  The contract included an optional service, which allowed for funding for services and programmatic activities at the evaluation sites.  The Government has exercised that option.  It is the Government’s intent to modify the contract to increase the effort involved in supporting the development and implementation of demonstration programs.  The Government intends to negotiate with the current Contractor, MDRC.  MDRC is the only contractor that can provide the services since they possess the skills, specific knowledge and resources to perform the tasks.  It is in the best interest of the Government, and was always the stated intent of the contract, for the current contractor to support the development of the demonstration services, provide the technical assistance to those programs, and evaluate the programs’ impacts.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) ; only one responsible source and no other supplies or sources will satisfy agency requirements.  As the current contractor, MDRC is uniquely situated to provide the required services.  The Government intends to proceed with a contract modification to MDRC 45 days after publication of this notice.  No solicitation package is available for this requirement.  Therefore, requests for such documents will be considered invalid responses.  See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>U -- Study of Father's Involvement in Permanency Planning and Child Welfare Casework
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-100-01-0014
<RESPDATE>050406
<ARCHDATE>05192006
<CONTACT>Anthony Webb, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-3580, Fax 301-443-2761, Email awebb@psc.gov - Rosanna Browning, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-6931, Fax 301-443-2761, Email rbrowning@psc.gov
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Urban Institute to provide additional data gathering and analyses in its study of nonresident fathers’ involvement in permanency planning and child welfare casework.  The proposed additional work would involve the acquisition and analysis of administrative data regarding case outcomes for children originally included in the original study sample. The Urban Institute is conducting the study of Father’s involvement in permanency planning and child welfare under contract number 100-01-0014.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   Any other potential source would need to establish new agreements and data sharing relationships with states that duplicate those already possessed by the Urban Institute and that have been developed over several years of working on the original study. The original study conducted interviews with the caseworkers of nearly 2000 foster children in four states (Arizona, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Tennessee).  The results of the study provide empirical evidence on the steps that child welfare agencies currently take to identify, locate and involve nonresident fathers in case planning; the barriers encountered; and the policies and practices that affect involvement. The proposed additional work would involve the acquisition and analysis of administrative data regarding case outcomes for children included in the original study sample.  Additional written products would be produced based on the new analyses.  At the time of the caseworker interviews, all children in the sample had been in foster care between three and thirty six months.  None of the child welfare cases were closed at the time the caseworker was interviewed.  For this reason, the study as originally designed could not examine the influence of father involvement on case outcomes. However, as the work on the original study comes to an end, study results regarding variation in caseworker efforts to identify and locate fathers and the differences in their success in contacting and involving the fathers of children in the study sample make it feasible and desirable to extend the study to examine the relationship between caseworkers’ initial activities with respect to fathers and the permanency outcomes achieved for children in foster care. Nearly two years after the initial data collection, most children in the study sample will by now have existed foster care.  It is the Interior of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)  to contract for a follow-up of the study sample to enable an analysis of how caseworkers’ initial efforts to contact and involve fathers relates to later case outcomes to be used to consider the following research questions: Do children whose fathers are contacted by the child welfare agency, as well as those whose fathers visit and/or are otherwise “more involved” with their children in foster care have different outcomes overall from those whose fathers are not contacted or involved?  Is permanency achieved more frequently or more quickly when fathers are contacted or involved?  It is possible that earlier involvement of the father and/or his family leads to better decisions that produce more stability in children’s living arrangements.  Is there evidence that contact and father involvement are related to fewer moves or otherwise more stable foster care experiences?  Are any overall outcome differences found related to specific discharge types?  Does father involvement seem to be related to increased reunifications, adoptions, and/or relative placements? The Contractor shall develop an analytical plan that shall: 1) Identify child welfare outcomes for which data will be sought, 2) Identify the data elements States will be asked to provide for each child in the study sample; 3) Suggest ways data might be presented to best effect; 4) Suggest how multivariate analytical approaches will be used to examine factors influencing case outcomes.  The contractor shall contact each of the States that participated in the original study and recruit them for participation in this follow-up effort. Once administrative data is received from the states, the contractor shall conduct the analyses based on the approved analysis plan. The contractor shall write a short report on findings of the case outcomes analysis and a technical paper intended to disseminate analysis findings to a more academic audience.   The contractor will brief federal staff and will present study results at two conferences outside the Washington, DC area.  Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing they can meet the Government’s requirements within 45 days from the date of publication.  Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to satisfy the stated requirements.  Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source to The Urban Institute.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The anticipated period of performance shall be (16) sixteen months.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation is available; therefore, requests for such a document will be considered inadequate responses. Responses must be submitted in writing to the attention of Anthony Webb at the above address by mail, via E-mail at awebb@psc.gov, or via facsimile at 301-443-1004.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) only*.  It is not a solicitation nor does it guarantee a solicitation will be issued.  This is an RFI for the purpose of conducting market research for an unmanned aerial system (UAS) supporting the detection of improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

Description of Need.  
Required Operating Capabilities.  The future Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) force will have to be more agile, responsive, deployable, versatile, lethal, and survivable across the full spectrum of military operations.  To increase the mobility of future EOD units, more technological efficient multi-capable tools must be developed.  

Current Situation: EOD forces are encountering large numbers of IEDs in urban settings, which have been placed above ground or within large vehicles.  EOD forces currently use a variety of robotic platforms for recon of IEDs, VBIEDs and secondary device searches.  These platforms are slow getting down range and the height at which the cameras can observe suspect items is limited.  The use of an unmanned aerial system would decrease time on target, eliminate exposing personnel to hazards and enhance reconnaissance capabilities.  
	
Therefore, the UAV Battlelab seeks a UAS with the following technical capabilities:  

   		a. One to two-man portable (<40 lbs).

b. Rugged and reliable, able to withstand daily usage operating in harsh environments (hot, cold, humid, dusty, sand, maritime).

c. Radio frequency remote controlled capable (300m range minimum), with hover capability and interoperable with current fielded EOD tools.

d. Low light and I.R. camera capable to view/observe suspect 
Devices.  One fixed camera to provide front view and a pan/tilt zoom camera for bottom view from UAV.  Ideally would like two pan/tilt and zoom cameras to provide 180 degree front and 360 degree bottom view from UAV.

e. One person operator control unit with video/controls clearly visible in direct sun without any washout or glare.

f. Battery operated (UAV & controller), rapid recharge capability using 110V/220V or heavy fuel (JP8 or diesel).    

    		g. Operational Capabilities. Threshold: 30 minutes. Objective: 45 minutes.

h. Computer based training to enable operators to simulate all aspects of UAV operations. 

i. Video feed real time to the operator on target, with real time link capability back to Tactical Operation Center (TOC).

j. Future development of payload capability.  

k. Semi autonomous flight, landing and takeoff.   

Interested parties are encouraged to submit a capabilities package in response to this RFI.  Capabilities packages should describe your capability to provide the UAS with the technical thresholds described above.  Additionally, capabilities packages should describe if the UAS is a mature technology (e.g., has it been fielded/sold in the past, or is it developmental?), provide information on any similarly awarded contracts, and provide company information (includes company size, point of contact information, etc.).

Responses to this RFI are due no later than 1600 Pacific Time on 3 April 2006.  Responses are requested not to exceed ten (10) pages.  Please submit responses to Captain David Huber at david.huber@nellis.af.mil, 1Lt Micah O’Neal at micah.oneal@nellis.af.mil, and Captain Josederic Scott at josederic.scott@nellis.af.mil.

Please direct any questions about this RFI to Captain Huber at (702) 652-3366 or 1Lt Micah O’Neal at (702) 652-5401.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE & REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  No solicitation is available.  This RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry.

The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) of the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding a scalable pricing structure of cellular data services with highly reliable global connectivity for the Marine Asset Tag Tracking System (MATTS - H-SB04.1-005) devices.  MATTS is a multi-modal communication gateway for Advance Container Security Devices (ACSD - HSARPA BAA 04-06), capable of providing global remote communications and tracking information for a container and is applicable to in-bond shipments.  As applied to this operational concept, utilizing cellular services, while technically feasible, is not economically practical worldwide due to the current pricing structures, account administration, and roaming agreements employed by cellular service providers.  Innovative and alternate strategies in these areas are sought.

<DESC>Background:  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international programs in various countries throughout the world, which address the entire range of customs and border control operations. To effectively implement these programs, there is a need for the utilization of contractors on an intermittent (short-term) basis.  Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 180 days or less.  Intermittent Contractors (ICs) will be required to perform various tasks such as those associated with training, utilizing specialized equipment, or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas. The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide under their contracts, as required. A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection and award of a specific contract.  

TRAINING: The IC shall service as a subject matter expert and/or presenter. He/she may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. Instruction may include, but not limited to, the areas of immigration law, visa security, boarding letters, document screening, port security, intellectual property rights, commercial import/export operations, customs valuation, and aviation and marine interdiction.  In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to have appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction. 

ASSESSMENTS: The IC may conduct on-site assessments of CBP operations located at U.S. embassies or consulates.  Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas, (e.g., areas of immigration law, visa security, boarding letters, document screening, port security, intellectual property rights, commercial import/export operations). Tasks could include interviewing DHS, State and other agencies as well as assessing line operations within the consulate offices. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the necessary experience and skills to complete an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs, and to prepare trip reports, summaries, analyses and recommendations. 

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as immigration law, visa security, legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech, port security or specialized field operations.  For example, in the area of immigration law, tasks may include the review of consulate procedures that impact on CBP policies and procedures in processing non-immigrant visa waiver issues and/or assessing the need for a CBP presence in a specific location.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise. 

AGUMENTATION and REPLACEMENT: The IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member. As an additional team member, the IC will undertake general or specific tasks associated with various projects such as the development of an interagency taskforce or the review of policies. As a replacement or fill-in, the IC may replace and assume the tasks of a technical team member who may be away from post for an extended period of time.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills to serve as an additional team member, or replacement member. 

TERMS and CONDITIONS: Most IC assignments will be less than 30 days, with adequate advance notice given prior to assignment/ deployment. While some assignments may last up to 180 calendar days, it is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 180 days in a calendar year.  If an IC declines more than two assignments, he or she may be excluded from further consideration at the discretion of CBP.

POSSIBLE DUTY LOCATIONS: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP conducts operations.  CBP training and assistance projects are currently ongoing in all regions of the world.

COMPENSATION and OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS: 1) ICs will be compensated for their performance on a fixed-priced basis at the rate of $2,400.00 per week for all ICs or prorating thereof (i.e., $480.00/day, $60.00/hour), for the period of time estimated by CBP for completion of the assignment, excluding travel days. 2) All authorized contract work will be paid at the above weekly/daily/hourly rates. There are no provisions for any overtime or premium pay. 3) The IC contract will include reimbursement for the mandatory required medical evacuation coverage, not to exceed $500.00, and medical examination costs up to $500.00, if the assignment is over a consecutive 45 days. 4) All travel will be under U.S. Government travel orders (separate and apart from the contract) and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government travel regulations. 

NOTE: ICs will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization. The IC will be responsible for purchasing airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel. ICs are NOT authorized to receive an advance for expenses for lodging, meals, and/or travel incidentals.

OTHER REQUIREMENTS: 1) Prospective ICs may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a SECRET security clearance from CBP. If for some reason a clearance cannot be granted, the prospective IC may be excluded from consideration from any assignments calling for such clearances. 2) For some specific assignments, foreign language ability may be a requirement for selection. 3) All materials provided to or developed by the IC under a contract are the property of CBP, may not be released to any other party without express permission from CBP, and are subject to return to CBP upon conclusion of the contract or otherwise upon receipt of a request from CBP.

<DESC>Attention Weapons Lubricant Manufacturers The US Army Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) has released  Revision E to MIL-PRF-63460, Lubricant, Cleaner and Preservative for Weapons  and Weapons Systems (CLP).  The major changes of this revision are; a change of  the test weapon, more stringent performance requirements in cold temperatures,  and increased operating requirements in more severe sand/dust environments.   This specification contains a qualification requirement that provides for  products to be evaluated prior to, and independent of, any procurement action.   Qualification testing will be initiated immediately.  Interested lubricant  suppliers are urged to contact the Government qualifying activity identified  below to receive detailed guidance on the qualification process.   Laboratory testing is anticipated to take about 60 days and must be  successfully completed prior to live-fire weapons testing which has been  requested for mid-July.  Lubricant suppliers are advised that the cost of  qualification represents a significant corporate investment, and that the cost  will be reduced when several candidate products can be tested simultaneously.   Future CLP qualification after this initial cycle will be adversely affected by  weapons availability and firing range scheduling. Upon successful completion of qualification, a new Qualified Products List  (QPL) will be published, listing only those products qualified to MIL-PRF- 63460E.  Future Government solicitations for CLP will only accept bids for  products listed on the current QPL-63460.    Information pertaining to  qualification of CLP products may be obtained from U.S. Army ARDEC, ATTN: AMSRD- AAR-QES-E, Picatinny, N.J. 07806-5000 or by email at ardec- stdzn@pica.army.mil.

<DESC>Medium Caliber Cartridge Case Venting technology The U.S. Army is placing increased emphasis on Insensitive Munitions (IM) to  provide a more cost effective,  efficient means of storing, transporting and handling munitions items safely.  The Strategic Plan prepared  by the Program Executive Office for Ammunition (PEO AMMO) mandates that medium  and large caliber munitions items be IM compliant. In an effort to address IM compliance for medium caliber munitions (25mm, 30mm  and 40mm), the U.S. Army  RDECOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, is conducting a Market Survey that seeks  to identify available and  applicable cartridge case venting technologies (e.g., vent windows, case  scoring (inside and/or outside),  combustible and polymer based cases, adapters, etc.) that will enhance the  reliability and mitigate the  reaction of munitions when subjected to unplanned stimuli. Technologies  identified for implementation  shall meet Insensitive Munitions requirements cited in Military Standard (MIL- STD-2105C) and associated  NATO Standards (STANAG) for external fuel fire/fast cook-off, slow heating/slow  cook-off, shaped charge  jet, bullet impact, fragment impact, and sympathetic reaction/sympathetic detonation. See Numbered Note 9.   In addition, ballistic performance and safety of munitions items must not be degraded.  	Interested responders must demonstrate their venting technologies as well as the ability in  applying such technologies to medium caliber munitions to enhance and improve  the reaction of the  munitions item when subjected to unplanned stimuli in an effort to achieve IM  compliance in accordance  with MIL-STD-2105C. All responders shall provide a summary of their company's  capabilities including the  organizationâ€™s name/address/point of contact, brief description of the venting  technologies to be used,  personnel, past experience; and whether the company is a small or large  business.  This Market Survey is for information and planning purposes only and shall not  be construed as a request  for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government.   The U.S. Government will  utilize the information provided for planning purposes only.  All information  submitted will be provided  at no cost to the U.S. Government and will be held in a Company Proprietary  status.

<DESC>This announcement is a market survey and Request for Information.  It is not an Invitation to Bid nor a Request for Proposals.  The Army has an urgent requirement to field 2,000 remote viewers for the Cupola Protective Ensemble (CPE) Program to inter face with the AN/PAS- 13 family of thermal sights (TWS) for light, medium and heavy weapons and other devices that output RS-170 video data.  The viewer is also being considered for wear with the explosive ordnance bomb suit.  A remote viewer requirement i s contained in the TWS Operational Requirements Document dated 20 January 1998 as a preplanned product capability improvement to the TWS (paragraph 4b15).  The requirement is also contained in an Operational Needs Statement dated 17 December 2004 from the XVIIth Airborne Corps for a goggle mounted viewer currently being staffed for approval at Headquarters, Department of the Army.  PM Sensors and Lasers requests interested parties submit their company name, address, phone number and point of contact, accomp anied by product literature and information on their product to the address below.  System Description:  The system must be a lightweight VGA or higher resolution 640 x 480 pixel minimum display.  The system must be capable of displaying RS-170 video from the TWS and other RS-170 video producing systems such as video cameras.  The system must be delivered mounted to currently deployed goggles (preferred) or be mounted to or by some other mechanism that allows the viewer to be worn under the CPE visor.  The key requirement that the display portion of the system must be able to fit under the  CPE face shield or visor is not waiverable.  Other general requirements for the display system include: low in weight; small in size; minimal vision obstruction; some degree of ruggedization; color presentation is not required; light security must be cons idered; brightness must be adjustable by the wearer; adjustable contrast is desired, either automatically, or by the user.  The viewer is desired to have a quick disconnect or breakaway connection near the helmet/goggle; or have a breakaway connection near  any battery/control box; employ a flexible (preferred coiled) cable to connect the display to the power source and controller if any, and to the TWS or video source; cabling and strain relief must be ruggedized to some degree, especially against abrasion.   The order of preference for power source is AA, CR123 batteries, or other battery listed on the CECOM LRC Power Sources website, in lieu of a proprietary battery.  The degree of light-security is a consideration but not a critical factor.   Currently, a cabled solution is preferred but a wireless solution is also of interest.

<SUBJECT>L--The Bureau of Reclamation, Albuquerque Area Office, has a need for a Executive Engineer to temporarily suuprt the newly-appointed Desingated Engineer (DE)
<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK The Albuquerque Area Office of the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the Regional Office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in Albuquerque is seeking an individual to temporarily support the newly-appointed Designated Engineer (DE) for the BIA.  The DE is responsible for ensuring that sufficient water is provided to meet the requirements of the six Middle Rio Grande pueblos for irrigation of prior and paramount lands.  In order to meet those requirements, the DE may request Reclamation to release water in storage at El Vado reservoir.  In addition, the DE must also work closely with the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District to monitor the water deliveries and operations of the distribution facilities. Based on preliminary indications, the Rio Grande basin will have low runoff this year.  As a result, the water operations could cause conflicts and disagreements among all of the stakeholders.  Therefore, the DE needs an individual to provide support and consultation on how to effectively work with all of the parties involved in the Rio Grande basin water operations.  In order to successfully complete this effort, the awardee must be extremely familiar with and knowledgeable of the policies, regulations, structure, and processes of the six Middle Rio Grande pueblos, the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, Reclamation, BIA, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Geological Survey.  The awardee also needs to understand the water operations and the potential impacts associated with changes to the water operations in the Middle Rio Grande valley.  In addition, the awardee needs to be skilled in dispute resolution as well as an effective communicator.  The awardee must be capable of acting as a calming influence in volatile situations, enabling the individuals and groups to reach agreement on potential solutions.  It is Reclamation's intent to hire an individual for approximately two months, beginning in April 2006.  The awardee will be responsible for introducing the DE to the various stakeholders, demonstrating how to work through various problems, and to help the DE become successful in their position.  It is anticipated that the first two weeks will require the awardee's effort full time (40 hours per week) and the remaining weeks will require approximately 20 hours per week.   At the end of the time period, the awardee will be required to complete a performance evaluation of the DE which will identify the strengths as well as weaknesses in the DE's performance.  The performance evaluation will be provided to the DE's supervisor.  In addition, the awardee will also provide recommendations for training as well as other suggestions which could enhance the DE's performance and enable long term success.

This data must include sufficient information that fully demonstrates the offeror’s capabilities and to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate the information and offeror capabilities relative to the above requirements.  Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall NOT be considered for this acquisition. The submission of this data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

(2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Firm, fixed price offers are requested under the Request for Quotes (RFQ) solicitation LAQ062008.  This document incorporates provisions and clauses which are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-08.  This solicitation is set-aside 100 % for small business.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 423490 size standard 12 million. The Bureau of Land Management, Alaska State Office has a requirement for: SUB-SURFACE MAGNET SPECIFICATIONS General The sub-surface magnet assembly, also called a magnetic marker, is required by the government surveyor to be deposited and oriented at the base of the hole which has been excavated for the setting of a survey monument post.  The sub-surface magnet is a cylindrical ceramic magnet housed within a plastic container.   Magnet The magnet shall be 7/8 +/- 1/32 inches diam. and 1 +/- 1/8 inch long.  The magnet shall be composed of strontium ferrite (chemically inert and anisotropic) Container  The magnet plastic container shall be 1 7/8 to 2 5/8 inches overall length, with 1 to 1 1/8 inches square end caps on a 1 to 1 1/8 in. diam. cylinder.  It is preferable that the magnet does not move about within the plastic container. The magnet plastic container shall be composed of polyethylene or equivalent end caps with a polyethylene or cellulose acetate cylinder or equivalent. The magnet plastic container shall have one end cap black in color, and marked "THIS END DOWN", "THIS SIDE DOWN", "BOTTOM", or equivalent nomenclature.  The other end cap and cylinder will be white or translucent white.   Upon final assembly, the case shall have no holes which would permit the intrusion of water.    General The total weight of the magnet and plastic container is approximately 2 ounces.  The sub-surface magnet assembly, when deposited in the ground and oriented with the black colored end cap down, shall be detectable with a Schonstedt Instrument Company magnetic locator, model No. GA52C or equivalent at a minimum range of 8 feet below a typical ground surface. Assembly The sub-surface magnet assembly shall be shipped assembled with the magnet contained and properly oriented in the plastic container with both end caps attached.  If the plastic end cap(s) are of a friction fit on the plastic cylinder, they shall be of a tight enough friction fit to require a minimum of 2 hands to disassemble the plastic container.  The minimum tightness of the friction fit specification is to prevent the accidental disassembly of the sub-surface magnet assembly in shipping, handling, or carrying in a backpack by a surveyor.     In the event that a hole exists in the case for an aid for air escape during assembly, it shall be plugged with silicone type material or equivalent upon assembly to prevent later water intrusion into the case.  The magnet will be oriented in the plastic container in order that the maximum detectable magnetic range is obtained (on the ground surface from the sub-surface magnet) when the black colored plastic end cap is placed in a downward position when the magnet is assembled in the plastic container and vertically aligned. Shipping The assembled sub-surface magnet assemblies, in their containers and considering their magnetic fields, will be packed vertically in a neat and orderly fashion in horizontal rows columns and vertical columns, with no spaces (not loose), and will be contained in a minimum of a cardboard box container,  designed for shipping, not exceeding 2 cubic feet. Each shipping container shall be clearly marked with the number of items per container, and number of containers Compliance with Chapter 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Department of Transportation, hazardous material transportation, regarding magnetized material, is the contractor's responsibility.  Delivery The magnets shall be delivered to the Bureau of Land Management at 6881 Abbott Loop Rd., Anchorage, Alaska 99507.   At least 2000 magnets are required no later than May 1, 2006.   The balance (2000) of the magnets are required no later than July 15, 2006.  STAINLESS STEEL PIPE WITH BRASS CAP SURVEY MONUMENT SPECIFICATIONS  General These specifications are for an assembled UNFLARED stainless steel pipe with brass cap survey monument for permanently marking survey positions on the ground.  The monuments are used by the government by shipping them from Anchorage throughout Alaska and then packing by the surveyor to the individual survey points, where the surveyor bends the survey pipe flanges to a ninety degree angle and buries the survey monument at least 3/4 of its length in the ground, in a hole dug by the surveyor. Specifications MONUMENT CAP The monument cap shall be a silicon bronze, bronze alloy, conforming to:  A.S.T.M. (Ingot) B-30 (872) or A.S.T.M. (Castings) B-584 (872) and B-271 (872) or  the equivalent. The silicon bronze, bronze alloy shall have the following nominal chemical composition:  copper	92 silicon	 4 zinc	 4 Equivalency is based on the durability and corrosion resistant properties of the monument cap in the following environments: acids, bases (alkaline), salts, and dissimilar materials (reduced galvanic reaction). The monument cap dimensions are shown in Drawing Nos. 1 and 2. The monument cap shall have a standard Cadastral Survey inscription conforming to Drawing No. 1.   The inscription shall be balanced and centered.  All letters and numbers shall be uniformly indented a minimum of 1/32 of an inch (not raised), have clean unbroken uniform lines, and be clear and legible.   The cap shall have a socket portion which is specially shaped to force fit over the outside diameter of the pipe's upper end.  The cap is held in place on the pipe by a solid stainless steel rivet, as shown in Drawing Nos. 2 and 3 or 4.   The surface shall be smooth and have a medium gloss, polish-like finish. The U.S. Government does NOT have a cast for casting the monument cap nor does it have dies for forging the cap.  It is the vendors responsibility to manufacture their own cast or die. A sample similar type monument cap showing the quality of inscription, depth of indentation, and degree of polish acceptable under terms of this contract is available for inspection. MONUMENT CAP MAGNET: The monument cap shall have a ceramic magnet permanently attached within the cap socket and retained by mechanical means.  For aid in assembly, an adhesive may be used in ADDITION to the mechanical retention. The ceramic magnet shall be capable of remaining in place should there be no adhesive or the adhesive should unbond between the monument cap or the ceramic magnet.   Recommended minimum magnet dimensions are as shown in Drawing No. 2. The monument cap magnet shall have a minimum detection range of at least  3.5 feet when using a Schonstedt Instrument Company, model GA-52C metal detector, or an equivalent metal detector.   PIPE CAP RIVET: The cap rivet shall be 3/16" x 3" flat or oval head rivet, solid stainless steel, type 304 or equivalent.  Equivalency is based on the durability and corrosion resistant properties in the following environments: acids, bases (alkaline), salts, and dissimilar materials (reduced galvanic reaction). MONUMENT PIPE The monument pipe is made from Type 304 or Type 316 stainless steel, Schedule 10 pipe, with a nominal inside diameter of 2 inches and cut 30" long.  The actual pipe inside diameter is  2.157 inches (2 5/32 inches).  The pipe wall thickness is  0.109 inches (7/64 inches).  The actual pipe outside diameter is 2.375 inches (2 3/8 inches).   The stainless steel pipe may be either seamless or continuous butt welded.  If there is a seam, it must be flush both on the inside and outside of the stainless steel pipe.  PIPE BASE The pipe base shall be either cut as shown in Drawing No. 3 or notched as shown in Drawing No.  4.  The 4 cuts or 4 notches in each pipe base must be equally spaced.  All of the monuments shall be shipped with UNFLARED bases !! ASSEMBLY: The monument cap shall be pressed onto the top of the pipe with a firm fit and shall bottom inside the cap.   The cap and pipe shall be drilled, fitted, and set with a rivet.  A matched through hole shall be drilled for the rivet using a guided "V" block, or equivalent, to assure the hole is drilled on the pipe center line.  Sufficient edge material must be allowed to prevent the rivet hole from cracking out when the rivet is set.  The rivet must be installed and finished with at least 5/16 inches diameter material on each end of the rivet after it is set (battered).   The final set (battered) rivet must be tight against the brass cap with no visible movement. If requested, the awardee shall be sent, at the expense of the government, a sample of a similar type survey monument.  The sample similar type survey monument shall be returned, at the expense of the contractor, at the time the first article is submitted or the first shipment of monuments is shipped. FINISH The finished monuments must be free of grease and mechanical oil on the exterior surfaces. Unflared monuments shall have no sharp burrs, capable of cutting an ungloved hand, on the exposed portions on the exterior of the monument. PACKAGING The monuments shall arrive at their delivery location orderly and neatly packaged onto standard shipping pallets using industry standard packaging and shipping procedures.

Definitions: FUDS Management Information System: FUDSMIS is a web-based d ata collection and ad hoc reporting system, to reside on the World Wide Web to be used as a program development/program management tool.  FUDSMIS enables the user to establish and maintain a database pertaining to environmental cleanup and to submit report s to higher headquarters.  The FUDSMIS system contains project information for FUDS properties.  The FUDSMIS system will be the principal source of information for the FUDS contribution to the Annual Report to Congress, which the DoD is required to submit under 10 USC 2706.  It records planning, programming, budgeting, and execution decisions for all echelons.  It supports HQs preparation of Program Objective Memorandum (POM), Budget Estimate Submission (BES), Presidents Budget (PB), Annual Workplan ( HQ s directive for divisions/districts execution), Annual Report to Congress (ARC), and DoD in progress Review presentation materials.  Annual Report to Congress (ARC):  The DoD publishes a report to Congress detailing the progress and accomplishments of DER P for each FY.  HQUSACE, as Executing Agent, is responsible to provide the requested information that makes up the ARC.  The initial request for development of the ARC is October for the previous FY.  PM Districts shall update their LCP and other required ARC data of the working data set in the FUDSMIS based on HQ instructions and submit it to Divisions during October through November each year.  Divisions review  and adjust the districts submission data set and submit it to HQ.  HQUSACE reviews and adjusts the FYDP/LCP of the divisions submission data and establishes the official FYDP/LCP in the FUDSMIS in late November/early December.  The preparation of the AR C, based on the HQ adjusted submission data set, is to be conducted by a DoD contractor.  The schedule of preparation is usually October through the following March.  Restoration Management Information System (RMIS): A DoD database used to track informatio n on the status and progress of activities at sites in the DERP program.  It has been superseded by Knowledge Based Corporate Reporting System (KBCRS).  Knowledge Based Corporate Reporting System (KBCRS):  KBCRS is a web-enabled application whose purpose i s to provide online access to corporate information about environmental (and eventually installation) programs and activities within the Department of Defense (DoD) and its component organizations.  DERP-FUDS: The Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) reflects DoDs commitments to: reduce, in a timely and cost effective manner, the risk to human health, safety, and the environment from contamination resulting from past DoD activities; encourage demonstration and validation of technology to reduce  hazardous waste generation; and protect human health and safety by removing unsafe buildings, structures, and debris remaining from past DoD operations.  FUDS is a subprogram of DERP.  FUDS includes former DoD properties that were transferred before Oct. 1986.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers executes the program for the Department of the Army and DoD.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  “Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  “Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6.  All provisions, clauses and specifications in the original solicitation remain the same and the due date for quotations is close of business March 30, 2006.  Clarifications are offered as follows:  1) The specification in line item number one states that expected flows are 2500 gpd average daily flow, and 5000 gpd peak daily flow.  The Government plans to refit an existing septic tank as an equalization tank which will reduce the affect of "peak flow" into the treatment system.  Therefore, we may consider systems that are rated to treat flows in the range of 2500 - 5000 gpd.  2)  Also in line item number one, the specification states that system must meet applicable State standards and certifications, including NSF International, standard 40.  This statement is revised to read "The commercial-sized system rated for 2500-5000 gpd should provide a treatment process equivalent to the technology used for residential-sized systems that meet the applicable local (Amherst County), state (Commonwealth of Virginia), and Federal standards and certifications (including NSP International Standard 40, Class 1 and US EPA Environmental Technology Verification).  Delivery product literature should include references to at least one system successfully permitted, installed and in operation in Virginia in conjunction with drip drainfield disposal systems.  Contact:  Diane_foote@nps.gov or Diane Foote at 828-271-4779 x231.  End of Amendment.
