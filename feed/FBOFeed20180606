<DESC>NOTICE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION - The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Miniature Munitions Division (EBM), Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I) program intends to solicit and award a contract to The Boeing Company, for SDB I Focused Lethality Munition (SDB I FLM) Production Assets. The SDB I FLM is an advanced fill in a composite-cased warhead and integrated into the existing SDB I weapon system including the SDB I airframe, fuze, firing train, and guidance/navigation hardware. This effort is in response to an urgent operational requirement to provide USAF aircraft platforms the ability to prosecute high-value targets having collateral damage sensitivity. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate for supplies with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. In accordance with FAR 5.207(c), responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but all proposals received within fifteen (15) days after publication of synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The Boeing Company is the current SDB I prime contractor and has sole responsibility for performance and warranty of the SDB I weapon system. To perform this effort, a contractor must have a detailed knowledge of the SDB I weapon system, including all of its subcomponents, and be familiar with the system modes of operations to meet performance specifications. This is necessary to understand the SDB I performance characteristics and weapon system interfaces to integrate a new warhead with explosive fill with the SDB I weapon system design and deliver the SDB I FLM capability without adverse impacts to mission operations. The Government does not own/possess a Technical Data Package for the SDB I weapon system nor will the Government provide one to complete this effort. The Boeing Company is the only known existing source of the technical expertise to support this requirement.<br /><br />The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center has appointed an Ombudsman to hear concerns from potential offerors relating to this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather the Contracting Officer identified. For any other concerns, interested parties may contact the following Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Ombudsman:</p>

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. 
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). 
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer. 
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. 
This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 60 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. 
While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer, Kevin Howe 405-734-8108, kevin.howe.1@us.af.mil.

<CONTACT>Lee Ann Carpenter, Phone 202-482-2583, Fax 202-482-5650, Email LeeAnn.Carpenter@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) to implement the move of the hardware component of the NATO Air Command and Control System Test and Verification Facility (STVF) from its current location in Glons, Belgium to a new facility in The Hague, Netherlands. The scope of this bid will encompass the activities necessary for the dismantling of the STVF from the current location, the move of the equipment and ancillary materials and the reinstallation of the STVF within the new building in The Hague, currently in the final phase of construction.
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) within the United States, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and 3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The IFB package will be NATO RESTRICTED. However, execution of the proposed contract will require unescorted access and work of contractor personnel in NATO Class I security areas. Accordingly, personnel of the winning bidder will be required to hold personnel security clearances at the level of NATO SECRET. Only companies maintaining the appropriate personnel security clearances will be able to perform the resulting contract.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-14798-FGFS, and all correspondence concerning this IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>Firms on the bidders list will be invited to participate in a combined Bidders' Conference and Site Survey that is currently scheduled to be held in September 2018. The Site Survey will be conducted in Glons, Belgium and, upon infrastructure availability, in The Hague. Firms are kindly reminded to take actions to have a valid security clearance of a minimum of NATO SECRET for the people who will attend the Site Survey.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for U.S. NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): 11 July 2018</p>
<p>- NCIA issues IFB (target): end of July 2018</p>
<p>- Bid Closing: October 2018</p>
<p>- Contract Award (target): December 2018</p>

<SUBJECT>Web application of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk score computations to indicate the frequency of screening among the United States population at risk for CKD
<SOLNBR>18-Q-68484
<RESPDATE>062118
<CONTACT>Leslie D. Jones, Phone 7704882042, Email jxy6@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), intends to award a sole source contract to Research Triangle Intitute (RTI), 3040 E. Cornwallis Road, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 for the web application of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk score computations to indicate the frequency of screening among the United States population at risk for CKD. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The period of performance for this procurement is 6 months. <br /><br />The objectives of this procurement are to provide CDC with an excel-based CKD screening decision tool that CDC will set up as web-based screening tool by primary care physicians. RTI was selected as the vendor for the proposed application because of their unique expertise in this type of work. Analysts at RTI have developed and validated these mathematical models and are the only ones to have applied such models to data in the U.S.
<p><br />This requirement is for conducting new analyses that will allow the web application of the published CKD Risk Score model using the CKD Health Policy models developed by RTI. The CKD Risk Score models are particular types of models with a unique structure created to address the complexity of chronic disease progression as a function of prevalent risk factors. Dr. Yarnoff has been working for many years on improving this model and adapting it for assessing cost-effectiveness of screening persons for early stage CKD. To date, none of the available screening scores has cost-effectiveness information. Recently, RTI identified CKD risk scores that are cost-effective for screening of a larger population at risk for CKD than just those with diabetes or hypertension.</p>
<p>This additional work will update the analysis to include different follow-up intervals for persons who are above the risk score threshold for screening but have different risk score levels. This acquisition is for additional analyses based on past work RTI completed for DDT. RTI is the only contractor that can perform this additional work in the period requested by CDC. It is in the government's best interest to take advantage of this expertise. If a different group was awarded the funds, it would require extensive training, and time and cost to develop the expertise to use these highly complex mathematical models.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Research Triangle Institute (RTI). However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 18-Q-68484 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN June 21, 2018. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>NSN 2540-01-538-3205, Armor, Supplemental. This material is being procured in accordance with CAGE 076M6 P/N 6432646-200M1 or CAGE 54786 P/N 6432646-200M1.  The required quantity is 851 each with no option to be shipped to DODACC (W25G1U) New Cumberland, PA  17070-5002.  The required delivery is 250 days.  FOB origin and Inspection and Acceptance at destination are required.  This solicitation is not set-aside for small business.   This material is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item.  However, interested suppliers may identify to the Contracting Officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with the commercial item with 15 days of this notice.  This solicitation will be available on the Internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of  March 9, 2018 (03/09/18).  Hard copies of this solicitation are not available.  <br />While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, proposals will be evaluated according to "best value" procedures on the basis of Price, Past Performance, and Delivery. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars.  <br />Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an agreement on Government procurement approved and implemented in the US. By the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.<br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. Preferred method to submit proposal is to upload through Dibbs.   Submit e-mailed proposals to Kristina.Wolf@dla.mil.  E-mailed proposals cannot exceed 15MB.

ACQUISITION PLAN 2 (ALDARS2)

Name:  Raymond T. Glembocki

Organization:  AAQ-330

Region:  FAA Headquarters (HQ)

Phone Number: (202) 267-0754

Email:  Raymond.glembocki@faa.gov

Date:  June 6, 2018

Archiving Date:   June 29, 2018

Posting ID:   June 6, 2018

Phase:  Market Survey

Procurement Method: To Be Determined

1.	ANNOUNCEMENT

In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1, this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested responders.  

This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  

2.	PURPOSE

This Market Survey is to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the information Section 6 and 7 below from interested responders.
The acquisition strategy for the procurement has not been determined at this time; however, either a full and open competition or a set-aside will be chosen depending on the responses to the market survey. All businesses are encouraged to respond.  

3.	SMALL BUSINESS

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAs 8(a) Program.
The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is NAICS number 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services from Sector 54 -- Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. The size standard is $27.5 million. 
The FAA will consider information submitted in response to this market survey in determining the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBAs 8(a) Program.  

4.	INTRODUCTION

The FAA is seeking interested vendors that are capable of providing replacement of the existing Automated Lightning Detection and Reporting System data dissemination service (ALDARS2).  The ALDARS2 effort is required to provide a new detected lightning data dissemination service for FAAs Next Generation (NextGen) Weather systems and users. 

The intent of the attached documents and slides are to define what the NextGen Weather detected lightning data needs are and what the minimum requirements are for a replacement service. These documents are also intended to provide enough information for interested vendors to decide whether they may be capable of providing a replacement service that meets the NextGen Weather systems requirements. 

5.	BACKGROUND

The primary mission of NextGens Common Support Services  Weather (CSS-Wx) is to provide the FAA with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that will geospatially filter weather products for the FAAs National Airspace System (NAS) systems and users and non-NAS systems and users.  CSS-Wx will replace the Automated Weather Observing Systems (AWOS) Data Acquisition System (ADAS), which is the current Consumer of the current ALDARS data service.

The current ALDARS contract Period of Performance (PoP) ends Close of Business September 24, 2019.  However, the Weather Program Office, AJM-333 needs to award a new ALDARS2 contract by September 1, 2018 in order to have a lightning feed in place and tested in time for formal testing of the NextGen Weather Processor (NWP) Aviation Weather Display (AWD) at William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) in March 2019.

6.	CAPABILITY STATEMENT

Interested vendors that have the capabilities to provide a detected lightning data dissemination service that meets the CSS-Wx requirements as set forth in the SPECIFICATION ATTACHMENTS should provide sufficient information to answer the questions in the enclosed Questionnaire and describe those items and capabilities in a compelling manner.  Interested vendors are encouraged to recommend economically efficient or new solutions that meet the specifications addressed in the enclosed SPECIFICATION ATTACHMENTS in addition to, providing comments on specifications and requirements.  Submitted documentation must clearly demonstrate that the vendor can provide a detected lightning data service meeting the coverage, parameters, schedule, and reliability needs of the FAA and should not to exceed 20 pages.  In addition to the submitted documentation, the vendor should also demonstrate the vendor's lightning detection capability by providing the vendors entire detected lightning data set for the month of May 2018.

7.	MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST

In order to be considered responsive, responders to this Market Survey expressing interest in this matter must provide the following:

a.	Capability Statement (not to exceed 20 pages) (Attachment 1).

b.	Completed Business Declaration Form (template attached) (Attachment 2).

c.	If applicable a copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form and/or proof of service-disabled veteran-owned small business status (Attachment 3).

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">This is a presolicitation notice for the purchase of two (2) 120 gallon water heaters, one (1) 40 gallon water heater, and a kitchen hot water booster at the Unity Healing Center. The requirement includes the purchase, delivery, and installation of all purchased equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Preference will be given to contractors in the local communting area.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Unity Healing Center located at 448 Sequoyah Trail Drive, Cherokee, NC 28719, is an Indian Health Service youth drug and alcohol treatment facility. This facility is approximately 12,400 square feet in size and is capable of holding up to 16 residents. The building was originally built in the late 1930s and had served as the Cherokee Hospital. In the late 1990s, after sitting abandoned for many years, the building was gutted and converted into a youth treatment facility. The building was last renovated in 2008. In an effort to comply with Executive Orders requiring use of renewable resources at Federal facilities, solar thermal hot water heating was added to the building in 2016. This system is capable of producing 100% of the demand for hot water on full sun days. On cloudy or no sun days, supplemental heating is required to provide domestic hot water to the facility. Currently the facility is operating on only one of two of the installed hot water heaters due to damaged caused by a water hammer event. Domestic hot water is used for hand washing, laundry, resident dishwashers, and resident showers. Domestic hot water also provides pre-heated water to the kitchen water heater where its temperature is boosted for kitchen use. The kitchen hot water heater is 10 years old and needs replaced as well.</p>
All questions regarding this requirement shall be submitted via email.&nbsp;

<p>BACKGROUND</p>

<p>The DDDS (NIA) has been engaged in basic research with a focus on identifying new medications for the treatment of mild TBI for over 10 years. We have evaluated a series of drugs based upon different pharmacological agents generated by the DDDS in small animal models of mild traumatic brain injury (1-7). Of these agents several are good candidates for further development as clinical drug treatments for mild TBI. One series of agents are of particular relevance to the regulation of inflammation. These drugs are based upon the backbone of the drug thalidomide. We have published several research papers where we have studied analogs of thalidomide and we have observed drug benefits in cellular pathology and animal behavioral deficits (8,9,10).</p>
<p>There are large numbers of people in the United States who suffer from mild traumatic brain injuries every year, presently there is no first choice FDA approved medicine to the treatment of mild TBI, it is our hope that our studies will help to identify drugs that will provide insight to defining new first choice treatments for mild TBI in humans.</p>

<SUBJECT>J--Dynamometer Maintenance 
<SOLNBR>68HE0C18Q0136
<CONTACT>Young, Sean
<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), with Prime One Contracting (POC) to furnish all parts, labor, supervision and equipment necessary to perform annual preventative maintenance on four, MAHA AIP-ECDM 48M-4WD and one MAHA AIP-CDM 72H-4WD Chassis dynamometers. POC will perform the tractive force adjustment to each dyno as well. POC will also evaluate the overall dyno drive, control system and operation of each dyno for defects and report any other recommended repair(s). 
 
The EPA has identified Prime One Contracting as the only contractor able to meet the requirements of this procurement. The Testing Services Group operates dynamometers in HTF (Hot Test Facility), CTF (Cold Test Facility), cell 5, cell 6 and HD chassis. All require annual maintenance and calibration performed at standards set in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommended maintenance and calibration schedule. This must meet standards set in CFR and will meet EPAs ISO 17025 specifications. Due to the proprietary nature of both the testing equipment and software that comprise the MAHA system along with the need to meet ISO17025 standards, POC is currently the only contractor that is able to supply parts and software with the ability to perform this work at the standards EPA needs. POC is the sole distributer and repair contractor for MAHA that manufactures, builds and writes the software for these system. No other contractor can complete this work. 
 
The acquisition of these commercial services will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519 Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing with a small business size standard of 500 employees. It is our intent to award a single fixed price purchase order to procure the required items. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice. Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice. Submit your capability statement in writing to Sean Young via email at young.sean@epa.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION. This announcement constitutes a PRE-SOLICITATION notice in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District hereby announces its intent to issue a solicitation for AERIAL VEGETATION CONTROL SPRAYING BY HELICOPTER. This solicitation is RESTRICTED TO SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION ONLY, under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 115112. The corresponding SBA size standard is $7.5MIL.
<p>A formal solicitation via a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items will be issued no sooner than 15 days from the publication date of this announcement. The RFP will be issued as a Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for Aerial Spraying by helicopter. <br />The basis for award and evaluation factors will be in accordance with the evaluation criteria outlined in the solicitation. This requirement will be awarded as firm-fixed price. The Government intends to award one (1) contract as a result of this solicitation. The duration of the resulting contract will include a base year and 4 options years. Task Orders of varying dollar amounts will be awarded within a period extending up to five years. Contractors shall be required to perform to a performance work statement, but in general the type and nature of the requirements will be in accordance with the " Description of Services" section within this announcement below.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:<br />This is a Services Contract for helicopter spraying of vegetation on sandbars in the Missouri River at Lake Oahe and from Pickstown, SD to Ponca, NE. The aquatic herbicides that need to be applied require helicopter spraying services as opposed to aerial (airplane) spraying services, due to the herbicide label requirements. Many of the areas to be sprayed prohibit the use of ATVs, tractors and other types of spraying equipment.</p>
<p>Threatened and endangered shorebirds nest on these sandbars, so spraying must occur after the birds leave, normally around Labor Day. Spraying must also occur before a hard freeze occurs, normally in early October. Therefore, the contractor has approximately one month to render services.<br />Please be advised of on-line registration requirements in the System for Award Management (SAM) database http://www.sam.gov/ and directed solicitation provisions concerning electronic annual Representations and Certifications.

<DESC>The Contractor shall provide all labor, tools, equipment, materials and supervision to perform the work indicated in this Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The tasks provided under this contract consist of the tasks listed.  The Contractor shall provide all ancillary tasks and materials necessary to provide a complete, useable space.

2.1 Background:  The Veteran required the use of several therapeutic modalities in reducing his chronic pain to a level enhancing his overall sense of health, well-being, and comfort. One of those modalities is the use of immersive hydrotherapy. This requires obtainment and installation of a hydrotherapy tub in his main bathroom. The intent of this construction project is to allow the Veteran the ability to utilize immersive hydrotherapy treatment interventions on a personal as-needed home-based basis, which is viewed as most therapeutic to his needs.

2.2 General Construction Activities: This project involves the removal and replacement of an existing typical bathtub in the Veteran s home with an immersive hydrotherapy tub. This main bathroom is on the second story of the home. The successful installation of the new tub will require the performing contractor to pay special detail in minimizing disturbance to the Veteran s home. The size of the selected bathtub will directly contribute to this effort and to the scope of this construction project.
