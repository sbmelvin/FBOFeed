The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC-A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the C3 Ombudsman at:</p>
<p>Office of the Senior Contracting Official - Afghanistan<br />Attn: SCO-A Ombudsman<br />Camp Phoenix<br />APO, AE 09320</p>
<p>E-Mail: PHNXSCO-APolicy.org@afghan.swa.army.mil</p>

<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, contract, delivery order, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>952.225-0019 Commodity Shipping Instructions - Afghanistan (JUL 2011)<br />(a) USFOR-A FRAGO 10-200. United States Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) has directed that all shipments into and out of the Combined Joint Operations Area - Afghanistan (CJOA-A) be coordinated through the Defense Transportation System (DTS) in order to expedite the customs clearance process and facilitate the use of in-transit visibility for all cargo in the CJOA-A</p>
<p>(b) Information regarding the Defense Transportation System (DTS). For instructions on shipping commodity items via commercial means using DTS, see the following websites:</p>
<p>1. Defense Transportation Regulation - Part II Cargo Movement - Shipper, Trans-shipper, and Receiver Requirements and Procedures:<br />http://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-ii/dtr_part_ii_203.pdf</p>
<p>2. Defense Transportation Regulation - Part II 4 Cargo Movement - Cargo Routing and Movement: http://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-ii/dtr_part_ii_202.pdf</p>
<p>3. Defense Transportation Regulation - Part V - Department of Defense Customs and Border Clearance Policies and Procedures: http://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-v/dtr_part_v_512.pdf</p>
<p>(c) Responsibilities of the vendor carrier representative, shipping expediter, and/or customs broker:</p>
<p>1. Afghanistan Import Customs Clearance Request Procedures: The carrier, shipping expediter, and/or customs broker is responsible for being knowledgeable about the Afghan Customs Clearance Procedures.<br />2. Status of Customs Clearance Requests: All inquiries regarding the status of a customs clearance request prior to its submission to Department of Defense (DoD) Customs and after its return to the carrier representative or shipping expediter should be directed to the carrier or shipping agent.<br />3. Customs Required Documents: The carrier representative or shipping expediter is required to provide the DoD Contracting Officer Representative (COR) with all documentation that will satisfy the requirements of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA).</p>
<p>(d) Required Customs Documents: Documents must be originals (or copies with a company stamp). Electronic copies or photocopied documents will not be accepted by GIRoA. The carrier is responsible for checking the current requirements for documentation with the Afghanistan Customs Department (ACD) as specified by the U.S. Embassy Afghanistan's SOP for Customs Clearance Requests Operations (http://trade.gov/static/AFGCustomsSOP.pdf) and paragraph 4 below.</p>
<p>1. The U.S Ambassador Afghanistan diplomatic note guarantees that the U.S. Government (USG) shipments are exempt from Afghanistan Customs duties and taxes. USG shipments do not provide commercial carriers with the authority to unnecessarily delay shipments or holdover shipments in commercial storage lots and warehouses while en route to its final destination. The U.S. Embassy expects that shipments will be expedited as soon as customs clearance paperwork is received from the respective GIRoA officials.</p>
<p>2. Imports. Documentation must list the year, make, model, and color of the commodity, the commodity Identification Number (if applicable) and for vehicles, the Engine Block Number. The following documentation is required for all import shipments:</p>
<p>a. An original Customs Clearance Request (CCR) prepared by the COR in accordance with Afghanistan customs guidance referenced in paragraph 4 below.</p>
<p>b. Bills of Lading (for shipments by sea), Airway Bills (for shipments by air) or Commodity Movement Request (CMRs) (for overland shipments). In the consignee block, type in "US Military". This will help the Afghan Customs officials to recognize that the shipment belongs to the US Military and, therefore, the shipment is subject to tax exemption provisions as specified under the current Diplomatic Note or Military Technical Agreement (MTA).</p>
<p>c. Shipping Invoices.</p>
<p>d. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo.</p>
<p>e. An Afghan Government Tax Exemption Form (Muaffi Nama) purchased from the Department of Customs and Revenue and prepared in the local language by the carrier representative, shipping agent, or customs broker.</p>
<p>f. A Diplomatic Note, prepared by DoD Customs, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the initiation of customs formalities with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Customs and Exemptions. Please note that DoD Customs is not responsible for registering vehicles. <br /><br />g. Commercially-owned equipment such as vehicles, construction machinery or generators that are leased and imported to Afghanistan for the performance of a USG contract may be subject to taxes and duties as determined by GIRoA. If commercially-owned equipment is imported into Afghanistan in a duty-free status, that duty-free status only applies as long as the equipment is under the exclusive use of the USG contract. If the equipment is released at the end of the contract, applicable GIRoA duties and taxes will apply to the owner if the equipment is not exported from Afghanistan or transferred to another USG contract.</p>
<p>h. USG-owned vehicles must be exported at the conclusion of the project period or transferred to another USG entity. Under certain conditions, the USG may transfer equipment or vehicles to GIRoA.</p>
<p>3. Exports. The following documentation is required for all export shipments:</p>
<p>a. An original CCR prepared by the COR. If COR is not available, the Contracting Officer (KO) will prepare the CCR.</p>
<p>b. Invoices.</p>
<p>c. Packing Lists. Required only if the shipping invoice does not list the cargo.<br /><br />d. A Diplomatic Note, prepared by the DoD Customs Cell, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the initiation of customs formalities with the Ministry of Finance, Department of Customs and Exemptions.</p>
<p>4. Customs requirements from the GIRoA may change with little notice. For current detailed instructions on customs guidelines in Afghanistan, refer to "The Instruction for Customs Clearance Request (Import/Export) Operations." In all cases, the carrier is required to obtain a copy of this document, found at the following link: http://trade.gov/static/AFGCustomsSOP.pdf</p>
<p>(e) Point of contact (POC) for customs issues is the USFOR-A Joint Security Office (JSO) J3 at DSN: 318-449-0306 or 449-0302. Commercial to DSN conversion from the United States is (732) 327-5130, choose option #1, and then dial 88-318 followed by your seven digit DSN number.</p>
<p>C3 Provision 952.233-0001 C3 Agency Protest Program (Nov 2010)<br />(a) This solicitation may be protested to the issuing Contracting Office for decision by the Contracting Officer or by the Chief of the Regional Contracting Center if authority has been withheld. If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC)/Senior Contracting Official (SCO) in accordance with FAR 33.103. A protest to C3 is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The C3 Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within C3, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>(b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the C3 Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by C3. Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following:</p>
<p>(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.<br />(2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.<br />(3) An award or proposed award of the contract.<br />(4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.</p>
<p>(c) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (f) of this provision for resolution of protests.</p>
<p>(d) For the purpose of filing a C3 Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.</p>
<p>(e) An Agency Protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number or e-mail address; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of Contracting Officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an Agency Protest for decision by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(f) C3 Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from Jonathan Roddy at Jonathan.Roddy@afghan.swa.army.mil.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
