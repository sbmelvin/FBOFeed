<DESC>Request for Information - RFI BLS-05-16
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is considering further action which may result in a contract for purchase.  This notice is a request for information from interested vendors who are able to satisfy the requirements detailed in the description below.
Introduction:  The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), an agency of the US Department of Labor, is the principal fact-finding agent for the Federal Government in the broad field of labor economics and statistics. The BLS is an national statistical agency that collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates essential statistical data to the American public, the Department of Labor, U.S. Congress, other Federal agencies, State and local governments, business, and labor.
BLS statistical programs cover employment and unemployment; wages, salaries, and benefits; consumer, producer, and import and export price indexes; consumer expenditures; occupational safety and health; occupations; and productivity.  BLS data must satisfy a number of criteria, including relevance to current social and economic issues, timeliness in reflecting today's rapidly changing economic conditions, accuracy and consistently high statistical quality, and impartiality in both subject matter and presentation.
BLS data are disseminated on the Internet, fax-on-demand, recorded message systems, printed information, and direct contact with  BLS information providers.  The data are widely used by Government economists to study the economy and the effects of policies; by business to escalate contracts; by academics for studies and the development of programs; and by individuals.   
BLS is headquartered in Washington, DC, and has 6 regional offices throughout the country.  Additional information can be obtained at http://www.bls.gov.
Outreach Research:  The BLS uses scientific sampling methodologies to sample firms to be contacted as potential reporters of data to be used in its surveys.  For most surveys, cooperation is voluntary.  BLS relies on its reputation for confidentiality to enlist and maintain cooperation.  Broad cooperation improves the quantity and quality of BLS data.
Through outreach research, BLS intends to expand survey cooperation and ensure that the data are relevant to users and potential users.  The goals of this outreach research include the following:  
*Identify concrete strategies that can be used to help the public understand the value of BLS data 
*Describe how various customers use our data and what we can do to make the data more useful to them
*Develop on-going mechanisms for communicating with customers, including our web-based customers, in order to receive feedback information on our products and services 
The project will begin in late Summer or early Fall 2005 and continue for approximately 6 months.
Submissions:  Interested sources are requested to submit a statement demonstrating their capability to perform all or some of the goals listed above.  Responses are limited to ten  pages and may include a description of the company and its experience relative to the performance of this or similar services and must identify its business size and whether designated a Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business and/or Women-Owned Small Business plus if on a GSA Schedule.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) plans to negotiate and award a follow-on contract on a sole-source basis with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in accordance with FAR 6.302.  The objective of this 6-month procurement is to conduct additional comparative tests on MITâ€™s patented compact plasma fuel reformer (plasmatron) using different alternative fuels. This MIT project, ongoing since May 1999, is experimentally investigating and characterizing the use of a plasmatron reformer, which generates a hydrogen gas from various transportation fuels, to both reduce emissions from diesel engines, in order to meet stricter emission limits for all heavy trucks and buses, and to improve fuel efficiencies.  The proposed additional experimental work will build upon the previous DOE funded efforts in plasmatron fuel reformer technology at MIT.

Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award.

FAR Clauses:  52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicit! ation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help y! ou gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-1 Buy American Act-Supplies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.o.B.

FAR Clauses:  52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicit! ation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help y! ou gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-1 Buy American Act-Suppplies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.o.B.

Title:  Replacement of PAMS subsystem of the GUARDRAIL Common Sensor System CECOM/ GUADRAIL weapon system teams plans to enter into an agreement for replacement of the Programmable Adaptable Modules (PAM) subsystem that is used on the GUARDRAIL Common Sensor System. The ultimate goal of this market research would be a contract for  development of a replacement for this system.  The current subsystem has numerous vanishing vendor issues and a high sustainment cost.  The contract would also provide for follow on to procure the replacement and for a limited sustainment contract. The su stainment of this new system should be designed for contractor sustainment in the short term with a plan to transition support to an organic source of repair. Anyone interested in providing a response should outline their experience with the current techno logy and have some suggested plan for replacement.

Delivery on July 14, 2005 is CRITICAL since there is only one barge a year that transports materials to Kalaupapa, Hawaii.  Should materials arrive prior to July 14, 2005, the Contractor shall be responsible for storage in Hawaii and delivery to Young Brothers.  The National Park Service will incur the cost of barge shipment from Honolulu to Kalaupapa.  Materials shall be delivered to Young Brothers covered and banded ready for barge transportation.  Materials CANNOT be delivered on flat racks to Young Brothers.  Shipping stickers will be provided by the National Park Service. If the Contractor fails to make delivery in time for the barge, the Contractor is responsible for making alternative means of transportation.  The only available means of transportation is barge to topside Molokai then helicopter from Molokai to Kalaupapa.  The hourly rate for helicopter rental is $650 per hour.  Final inspection and acceptance of materials by the Government will occur when materials arrive in Kalaupapa.  The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition and are available at www.arnet.gov:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions of Offerors-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions, FAR 52.211-11 Liquidated Damages-Supplies, Services, or Research and Development (Sept 2000) (a) If the Contractor fails to deliver the supplies or perform the services within the time specified in this contract, the Contractor shall, in place of actual damages, pay to the Government liquidated damages of $300 per calendar day of delay.  (b) If the Government terminates this contract in whole or in part under the Default-Fixed-Price Supply and Service clause, the Contractor is liable for liquidated damages accruing until the Government reasonably obtains delivery or performance of similar supplies or services. These liquidated damages are in addition to excess costs of repurchase under the Termination clause. (c) The Contractor will not be charged with liquidated damages when the delay in delivery or performance is beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor as defined in the Default-Fixed-Price Supply and Service clause in this contract.  FAR 52.214-34 Submission of Offers in the English Language, FAR 52.214-35 Submission of Offers in U.S. Currency, FAR 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, FAR 52.219-8 Utilization of Small Business Concerns, FAR 52.222-3 Limitations on Subcontracting; FAR 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration, FAR 52.247-.34 F.O.B. Destination; FAR 52.249-8 Default (Fixed Price Supply-Service).  Evaluation of Commercial Items:  The following evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate proposal submission:  (1) At least three or more previous experiences with shipping materials to Hawaii; (2) Lead time needed to purchase and ship materials, confirmation of the critical delivery of materials to Honolulu and Young Brothers by July 14, 2005; and the Offeror's ability to meet that date; (3) Capability to store materials in Honolulu identifying available storage facilities; and (4) transportation capability of delivery to Young Brothers for barge transport.  The evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance.  Award of any contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation will be based on best value to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.  Technical quality is significantly more important than cost or price.  Price will be a factor in the award decision, although the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  As the technical merit and evaluated cost or price becomes essentially equal, other factors may become the determining factor.  The Government reserves the right to make award without further discussion.  Proposals shall be submitted in an original and three copies by no later than 12:00 p.m. on May 2, 2005 to:  Historic Preservation Training Center, 4801A Urbana Pike, Frederick, Maryland  21704.  Proposals shall include the following information:  Technical Information:  (1)  Identify in writing at least three or more previous experiences with shipping materials to Hawaii; (2)  Identify lead time needed to purchase and ship materials, and confirm your understanding of the critical delivery of materials to Honolulu and Young Brothers by July 14, 2005, and the Offeror's ability to meet that date.  Confirm your understanding of the consequences of failure to meet the delivery date based on the Liquidated Damages Clause, and the requirement for the Contractor to incur the cost of alternative means of transportation if materials do not arrive in time.

<DESC>The National Park Service intends to issue a Prospectus for the operation of Drakes Beach for the operation of food and beverage services, with limited grocery and retail sales located in the Kenneth C. Patrick Visitor Center complex at Point Reyes National Seashore.  This business opportunity includes government-owned assigned facilities within the park.  Any Offeror that is selected as the new concessioner is not obliged to purchase the personal property and inventory utilized by the existing concessioner in its operations.  The existing concession contract between the National Park Service and the existing concession expires on December 31, 2005.  The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR Part 51, has determined that the existing concessioner is a preferred Offeror for this contract because the first year sales are projected to be less than $500,000.  One contract will be issued for this commercial service.  The length of the new contract will be for ten (10) years.  Any offer, including that of the existing concessioner, must be received by the Concessions Program Manager, National Park Service, Pacific West Region, 1111 Jackson Street, Suite 700, Oakland, CA 94607 no later than seventy-seven (77) days after the date of publication of this notice in order to be evaluated and considered for an award of a concession contract.  The Prospectus will be issued April 26, 2005, for a 77-day response period under the terms described in the Prospectus, with proposals due on July 12, 2005, no later than 4:00 p.m.  There is a printing cost recovery charge of $50 per copy to be delivered via Federal Express or $40 per copy if picked up in person.  Checks or money orders (no cash accepted) must be payable to the National Park Service; and you must include a business address (no post office box) to receive a Federal Express package.  Prospectus Packages will be available by contacting Darby Watson, Financial Analyst, or Anne Dubinsky, Concession Program Manager, Pacific West Region Concessions, 1111 Jackson St., Oakland, CA 94607.  Telephone inquiries may be directed to 510-817-1365 or 1366.

<DESC>The RACs 2 contracts will consist of professional architect/engineer, technical and management services in support of Region 5's remedial response, enforcement oversight and on-time critical removal activities at sites of release or threatened release of hazardous substances.  These services will be provided within EPAs Region 5 (IL, IN, MI, MN, OH, WI) and on occasion in other EPA regions. This will be a cost plus award fee, level of effort contract with an estimated possible contract value of $362,000,000.  Two contracts are anticipated to be awarded an unrestricted (PR-R5-05-10045) and a small business set-aside (PR-R5-05-10037).  The NAICS code 562910 which has a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The SF-330 Architect-Engineer Qualifications is due by May 13, 2005.  Additional information, is  posted on EPA?s acquisition site http://www.epa.gov/racs2 The contract specialist for the Small Business Set-Aside (PR-R5-05-10037)  procurement is Tawanda Thomas, she can be reached at thomas.tawanda@epa.gov.    The contract specialist for the full and open (PR-R5-05-10045) procurement is Kimberly Bishop, she can be reached at bishop.kimberly@epa.gov.  The Placement Contracting Officer for these procurements is David Alberts, he can be reached at alberts.david@epa.gov.  SF330/PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS Total Government Requirement (a)  The EPAs Region 5 estimated RAC2s requirement, if split evenly between the two contracts - the full and open (PR-R5-05-10045) and the small business set-aside (PR-R5-05-10037) would result in two equal contracts reaching the requirement limits exactly.  For proposal purposes, offerors should assume that this contract represents more than ? of the Agencys regional requirement. (b)  This will allow the Government to respond to unexpected but potential: 	|	Regional crossovers 	|	Contractors ineligibility to perform work (e.g., due to conflicts of interest) 	|	Contractors inferior past performance (c)  Though EPA does not specifically anticipate such needs, it reserves the right to issue work assignments under this contract in excess of half of the Agencys regional requirement. In no event will the value of the total work assignments issued under this contract exceed the maximum contract value as stated in clause B.2, entitled Estimated Cost, Base Fee and Award Fee. General Proposal Instructions For this procurement, EPA requires offerors to organize their information in the SF 330 and any additional documentation, as described below.  EPA will evaluate offerors SF 330s and additional documentation on the five evaluation criteria listed below. Offerors should submit 10 hard-copies and one electronic copy (on disc in a word perfect, MS Word or PDF Format) of their SF 330s.  If documents are submitted utilizing Portable Document Format (PDF) offerors shall follow the conventions described under the accessability guidelines which are described in the authoring tools section of Acrobat Reader.  For more information on this guidance, please visit  www.section508.gov.  Following EPAs review of the SF 330 and supporting documentation, EPA will develop a short list of the most highly rated firms.  Short-listed firms will be referred to as selected firms.  Selected firms will be invited to participate in oral presentations. The specific details on the oral presentations will only be provided to the selected firms.  Oral presentations will address and augment evaluation criteria 3 and 4.  No specific evaluation points are assigned to the oral presentations.  Selected offerors should be aware that their overall scores depend on both written submissions and their oral presentations. Following oral presentations the proposals will then be ranked with the most highly rated firm ranked first.   The source selection authority will make the final selection from among those firms. The final firm will then be asked to submit: 		Conflict of Interest Plan 		Quality Management Plan 		Representations and Certifications 		Cost Proposal Instructions for the preparation for each of these submissions will only be provided to the firm with whom EPA intends to conduct negotiations.

References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.   (h) Any information collected concerning an offeror's past performance will be maintained in the official contract file.    (i) In accordance with FAR 15.305 (a) (2) (iv), offerors with no relevant past performance history, or for whom information on past performance is not available, will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably on past performance.

<DESC>FISC Norfolk Philadelphia Division, Contacting Department is soliciting innovative concepts to improve the Navy Planning and Programming Processes in support of the Deputy Chief of Naval operations (Resources, Requirements & Assessments)(N8), Department of the Navy (DoN).  N8 has an ongoing responsibility to maintain and administer resource allocation processes with a specific focus on building and defending the Navy Program Objective Memorandum (POM), Program Review, and related programming and budgeting products.  This effort requires the development of a process that is capable of creating near and long-term strategies that influence the investment alternatives that support Naval Warfighting Objectives.  The process must be repeatable, analytically based, and capable of identifying a range of alternative approaches to meeting corporate objectives within fiscal constraints.  In order to increase the overall fidelity of the Navy Program build and to create a program that has enduring qualities beyond the immediate Future Year Defense Plan, the Navy is interested in exploring the state of what is possible with respect to Navy programming from those firms that possess a clear and demonstrable record of accomplishment of participation in strategic planning, risk assessment and programming at a level comparable to an Echelon I Navy activity.   FISC Norfolk is soliciting these innovative concepts on an unrestricted, full and open competitive basis.  As stated during the Pre-Solicitation Conference conduced on 14 April 2005, it is paramount that offerors responding to the solicitation possess tangible, relevant and timely experience in business process re-engineering and strategic planning efforts with an organization comparable to the United States Navy.  The solicitation will require the submission of technical and price/cost proposals.  The evaluation of proposals will consider the offeror’s technical proposal to be significantly more important than the offeror’s price/cost proposal.  At a minimum, the technical evaluation will evaluate offerors’ demonstrable corporate expertise and capability in this type of project, as well as offerors’ ability to provide examples where a process improvement was proposed, implemented and had significant Return On Investment (ROI) from a previous consulting engagement.   This acquisition will result in the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Type contracts.  The issuance of task orders against the mutiple award IDIQ contracts will be utilized to further define contractor's innovative concepts and to obtain a Plan of Action and Milestones (POAM) and the costs associated with execution of this POAM.  The Navy reserves the right to conduct a second tecnical evaluation based upon the results of the IDIQ task orders to downselect the single innovative concept that represents the best value to the Navy, technical merit and price considered.   Numbered note 26 applies.  The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 541611.  The solicitation will be made available electronically upon its release at www.neco.navy.mil.  Paper copies, faxed copies, or e-mail copies of the solicitation will not be provided.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the above website for posting of the solicitation and any amendments thereto.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for the services of a contractor to  convene an expert panel of vocational and occupational medical experts and disability policy and program experts for a study that will review the value and efficiency of using vocational experts at various levels of the disability determination process currently used by SSA to determine eligibility for the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability programs.  The purpose of this study is to enhance the expertise needed in disability decision making related to functional limitations of a claimant’s ability to perform jobs available in the national economy.  The contractor will direct and oversee the project and work with panel members, as necessary, to develop the required research and policy papers on which the expert panel will deliberate.  The contractor will convene an expert panel to 1) assess the current use of vocational and occupational medical expertise throughout SSA’s disability determination process; 2) determine how to provide needed vocational and occupational medical expertise at all levels of the disability determination process to improve the quality of case adjudication; 3) determine how the needed expertise should be provided – specifically, should SSA create a national or regional cadre which would be available to all disability adjudicators?; and 4) determine what qualifications candidates should have to provide vocational and occupational medical expertise.  SSA anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price (with reimbursable travel) contract with a period of performance of 27 weeks from the date of award.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541720, with a size standard of $6.0 million.  Solicitation number SSA-RFP-05-1037, is scheduled for release on or about May 6, 2005, with proposals due 30 calendar days thereafter.  The solicitation will be available for downloading from the Federal Procurement website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  HARD COPIES OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE MAILED.  Telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders list will be maintained.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the FedBizOpps website to check the status of this requirement and to keep current with any amendments that may be issued.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  All questions must be submitted via email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Bash Acquisition and Financial Advisor OSD Net Assessment 1920 Defense Pentagon Washington, DC 20301 Phone: 703-697-1312, Ext. 113 FAX: 703-695-3810 Email: Rebecca.Bash@osd.mil	 1.  BACKGROUND  The idea of the long-term competition  the notion that powers are engaged in a long running contest for position and influence in geostrategic affairs  has for more than 30 years stood at the center of thinking about diagnostic net assessments and the de fense strategies these assessments support.  As an analytic framework, the long-term competition perspective threw into sharp relief some of the most important questions about the overall U.S. position in the cold war; questions about how the U.S. was fari ng in those areas of military competition that were most crucial in the political-military contest with the Soviets.  Now we face questions about how well this analytic framework can serve in a new competitive environment: what does the emerging long-term competition look like?  What sub-competitions are most important?  How can we measure U.S. performance in these competitions in the absence of a high-end competitor?  How well do related ideas about strategies for competing over the long term  ideas like cost-imposing strategies  bear up in the new emerging competitive environment? The goal of the proposed project is to answer these and other related questions extensive analytic work on the changing competitive environment and the adaptation of traditional analytic methods and strategies to the new position, goals, and defense strate gy of the United States. 2.  OBJECTIVE The objective of the proposed project is to assist the Director, Office of Net Assessment, in developing analytic approaches, intellectual frameworks, and strategic concepts related to adapting the long-term competition perspective to the emerging competit ive environment.   3.  DESCRIPTION OF TASKS AND DELIVERABLES  The approach for this proposed project is to undertake, in close coordination with the Director and others in the Office of Net Assessment, a thorough review of new approaches for analyzing U.S. performance in the long-term competition and the suitability of new strategies for success in this competition.  The analytic and research program can be broken into three tasks: 1.	Diagnosis of the U.S. Position and Competitive Strengths 2.	Analytic Methods in Support of the Long-Term Competition 3.	Strategic Approaches for the Future Task 1: Diagnosis of the U.S. Position and Competitive Strengths One of the first things to address is the problem of analyzing U.S. performance in the long-term competition.  What is the new competition about?  What sort of competitive position does the U.S. stand in today?  What areas of military competition are likel y to be the most important in the decades ahead?  How can we measure U.S. performance when the U.S. lead is so great and there is no identifiable high-end competitor? Answering these questions will begin with a diagnostic analysis of current competitive position of the United States.  It is evident that the U.S. stands far ahead of the rest of the world in many if not most areas of military competitionthis is a legacy of decades of investment over the course of the cold war as well as the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Any assessment of the competitive position of the United States must then take account of where these strengths are most pronounced: in what areas of mil itary competition is the United States most dominant?  What are the military competences  in areas such as training, or large-scale joint operations  that are the real keys to U.S. military pre-eminence? There will also be consideration of more basic, structural advantages.  A legacy of high investment during the cold war is not the whole of the story; the U.S.  also possesses some set of unique competitive advantages  cultural, social, political, geographic  that have helped translate large-scale investment into military strength.  What are these sources of U.S. military advantages? Finally, any complete diagnosis will have to address the matter of strategic fit: as we look across the advantages and competitive strengths that the United States brings to the competition, we will need to consider how well these are suited to the kinds o f missions the U.S. military will undertake in the decades ahead.   Through a combination of discussions with subject-matter experts and independent research and analysis, the contractor will address these and related questions.  The deliverable for this Task will be a written report not to exceed 20 pages as well as other  memoranda, briefings, and short papers requested by the client over the course of the period of performance. Task 2: Analytic Methods in Support of the Long-Term Competition The work on this Task will focus on the development of new or adapted analytic approaches appropriate to evaluating U.S. performance in the long-term competition.   One of the central questions regarding a greater emphasis on assessing areas of U.S. military advantage is how defense analysts might go about tracking the relative strength of these advantages over time.  If we determine, for example, that the United Stat es has benefited from a history of organizational and technological innovation, how we can devise metrics or methods for chronicling the real depth of that strength as it changes over time?  Addressing this question will entail serious thought about the ki nds of assessments that the measures and metrics will support, and about the problem of tracking slight but significant change over time. There is related work already underway in other parts of DOD, primarily related to the effort to develop approaches to Capabilities-Based Planning.  This approach to defense planning is predicated on the notion that as the security environment has change d the U.S. should now place greater emphasis on understanding and exploiting its own strengths rather than planning reactively to the threats posed by opponents.   The deliverables for this Task will include a series of memoranda and briefings for the Director, Office of Net Assessment, and other interested officials within the Department of Defense. Task 3: Strategic Approaches for the Future Task 3 will center on the development or revision of strategic concepts for the long-term competition relevant to the competitive position of the United States and the nature of the future security environment.  How relevant are the kinds of strategic appr oaches initially developed during the long-term competition with the Soviets? At least two different strategic approaches will merit particular attention: "	Cost-Imposing Strategies: Competitors have long sought opportunities to force their opponents to expend disproportionate resources in areas that appear unpromising or unthreatening.  The U.S. may have a particular opportunity to pursue such a strategy gi ven the central role the country currently plays in international military competition.  Considerable thought must be given to how, if at all, the concepts related to cost-imposing strategies have changed in light of the overwhelming U.S. superiority in av ailable defense resources and the wide array of potential opponents the country must take into account when trying to develop such strategies. "	Dissuasion Strategies: The U.S. may also have the opportunity to drive opponents entirely out of some select areas of military competition.  It is possible, through considerable investment in areas of comparative efficiency, that the U.S. may so raise th e barriers to entry that other countries simply abandon the notion of competing in that area.  While this is an appealing concept, it clearly requires greater thought: What areas are most promising?   Have such strategies worked in the past?  What are the consequences of failure?  What are the metrics for success? The deliverables for Task 3 will consist of a written report not to exceed 30 pages examining various strategic approaches, as well as other memoranda, briefings, and hort papers requested by the client. Deliverables The Deliverables for this project will be: Task 1: A written report not to exceed 20 pages as well as other memoranda, briefings, and short papers may be requested by the client over the course of the period of performance. Task 2: A series of memoranda and briefings for the Director, Office of Net Assessment, and other interested officials within the Department of Defense. Task 3: A written report not to exceed 30 pages examining various strategic approaches, as well as other memoranda, briefings, and short papers requested by the client. 7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE Due to of the evolving nature of this project and need for close collaboration, the Contractor shall provide on-site support for the duration of the period of performance.   8. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS Personnel cleared at the Top Secret/SCI level are required for the performance of this effort.  A DD Form 254 will be provided. 9.

[This procurement is an unrestricted procurement with the Price Evaluation Preference Provision 52.219-4.]  The Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Region, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) firm-fixed price construction contract for the Lauro Dam Project.  Reclamation, has a future requirement to perform construction work at Lauro Dam.  Lauro Dam and Reservoir are located on Diablo Creek, on the northern edge of the city of Santa Barbara, California.  The dam, which was constructed in 1952, is a zoned earthfill embankment with a structural height of 137 feet, a crest width of 30 feet and a crest length of 540 feet at elevation 567.5.  Lauro Reservoir is a regulating reservoir on the South Coast Conduit.  Inflow to the reservoir occurs via a turnout from the South Coast Conduit at a baffled drop structure located on the left side of the reservoir rim.  Its primary purpose is to meet the peak water demand for the City of Santa Barbara.  Lauro Dam is classified as a high-hazard facility due to the potential for downstream loss of life in the event of failure.  The proposed construction work on Lauro Dam consists of a structural modification that incorporates a downstream filter and drain.  The work will require dewatering and excavation of the downstream face and toe of the dam, placement of layers of sand filter and gravel drain materials over the core material within the excavated area where an existing foundation fault exists.  Original embankment material will be placed over the drain materials, resulting in a significant portion of the crest and downstream face of the dam being wider than the original configuration.  The work will require the contractor to excavate at the toe or downstream portion of the dam with an active reservoir (reservoir elevation will not be lowered for construction).  The dam and associated land has limited work areas, staging areas are small, and limited stockpile areas.   The work requires over 4000 truck trips through residential areas to get material to and from the jobsite.  The contractor will be required to work limited hours due to city noise and work ordinances.  The value of the work is estimated in excess of $10 million.  The contract duration is contemplated for 12 months.  It is anticipated that award of the work will occur in September 2005.  This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Information on Annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.orca.bpn.gov.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed by e-mail to the Contract Specialist/Margaret Kirkpatrick at mkirkpatrick@mp.usbr.gov.  [The solicitation will be available on or about May 13, 2005.]  The NAICS code is 234990 (All Other Heavy Construction) 18.  N/A 19.  N/A

*********************************AMENDMENT A001****************

The purpose of this amendment is to extend the proposal due date from 3:30 p.m. eastern standard time on April 22, 2005 to 3:30 p.m. eastern standard time on April 26, 2005 and to provide answers to the technical questions received as follows:  

1.	Section II.A.a of the of the Statement of Work (SOW) states the following: "The database shall contain the entire list will automatically be updated without requiring any manual processing by BIS personnel;" There appears to be something missing from this requirement, please clarify.

Answer: 
The database containing the entire list must automatically be updated without requiring any manual processing by BIS personnel.  In other words, subscribers should be able to subscribe and unsubscribe with out any actions by BIS employees.  Also when subscribers’ addresses are no longer valid, the system should automatically purge those accounts.

2. Section II.A.b.3 state "telephone, are code only."  Please
confirm that this should read "telephone, area code only."

Answer: There are two distinct lists.  The first list is the BISWebCast list containing about 3,000 names.  Its subscribing form collects name, email address, and the various topics of interest to the subscriber.

The second list is the SEMINARS list.  Its subscribing form collects email address, AREA CODE (for geographical purpose), state, and
country.

3. Section II.C.4 indicates that the contractor will be responsible for migrating lists "containing approximately 3,000 total current subscribers," while Section II.D.5 states that "We current [sic] have approximately 5,000 subscribers to our List."  Please clarify whether there are currently 3,000 or 5,000 subscribers.

Answer: There are two distinct lists.  One is about 3,000 and the other
5,000. There is no word perfect file or Access data base; the lists are in a comma delimited Excel document.

4. Section II.C.4 indicates that the two lists to be migrated are in Access and WordPerfect.  For costing purposes, please provide additional information on the following:
a.   	Please provide the fields and structure of the Access database.
b.  	Please list the fields contained in the Word Perfect file.
c.	Do the two lists contain fields that correspond exactly to those listed in Section II.A.b of the SOW (email address, geographic location, telephone-are [sic] code only, types of information they wish to receive, business or personal email address).


d.	Will migration of these lists to the new database require parsing, editing, or other manipulation of field contents to effect the migration?  If so, please provide details so that the level of effort can be accurately estimated.
e.	Will any clean-up of current lists be required?  If so, please provide 
details so that the level of effort can be accurately estimated. Please reference answer after 
f.        With respect to the WordPerfect file, how is information stored in this file?  That is, is it in a table, a fielded format, delimited, or just straight text?

Answer: BIS has tested downloading the data from the current contractor and BIS is using the current contractor utilities so that BIS can download the data as a comma delimited Excel document. Attached is the actual content of the download from the BISWebCast list (for two records only).  Be advised that most of the fields are vendor created for administrative purposes.  BIS only is interested in the fields described in Question 2 above.

5. Section II.D.4 indicates that "It is anticipated that there will be at least three broadcast email messages set each month."  For costing purposes, please indicate who will be responsible for sending these messages, BIS or contractor personnel and who will write the content of the messages?

Answer: BIS personnel (either contractors or federal) will write and send the messages. The writer will be responsible for sending it.

6. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) does not indicate on what basis or how often the contractor is to invoice and will be paid.  Please provide additional information.

Answer: Invoice shall be submitted once a month.

7.	Proposal instructions included in the RFQ do not indicate what Standard Form is to be used for submission of quotes.  Please specify.
 
Answer:  A Standard Form is not required.  Potential Offerors are required to submit a separate price and a separate technical proposal in response to this RFQ. Offerors must submit a one original copy of the technical proposal and two copies and one copy of the price proposal.  If the Offeror elects to submit electronically, a separate file is required for the price and technical proposal and one original hard copy of each.

At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.

The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.

<DESC>The sources sought originally published on April 14, 2005 is hereby amended to read: Northern Region Contracting Center-Leavenworth (NRCC-L) is seeking small business sources capable of providing analytical support services for the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center (TRAC), Fort Leavenworth (FLVN), Kansas and supported  activities at other U.S. locations and TRAC, White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico and supported activities at other U.S. locations.  The TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC) is the principal operations research activity for the U.S. Army Training and Doc trine Command (TRADOC) and conducts analyses and studies that provide senior decision-makers with information necessary to make decisions regarding proposed concepts, requirements, and programs.  This is accomplished by supporting leaders and soldiers with  operations analyses, experimentation, warfighting scenarios, combat modeling and simulations, operational effectiveness analysis, and planning and decision aids.  TRAC leads the TRADOC team in conducting major studies and analysis to support Army Doctrine , Organization, Training, Materiel, Logistics, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) issues associated with the transforming Army.  In providing this support, TRAC develops, manages, operates, and maintains the analytic support infrastructure (tools, scenari os, data, and simulations) to enable analysis of Army combined arms operations in a joint and coalition context.  TRAC also identifies critical warfighting requirements based on technologies and concepts often in the form of technical reports or related do cumentation which may include graphical design, which would effectively and efficiently integrate operational capabilities among the DOTMLPF areas.  This solicitation also includes the analysis related support functions of computer operations and maintenan ce, security, administration, graphics, supply, and technical editing.  All these services are classified under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 541690, with a small business size of $6 million.  Multiple awards for the TRAC-FLV N location and multiple awards for the TRAC-WSMR location are anticipated.  Indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contracts are anticipated, each with a twelve (12) month base period and four (4) one-year option periods.  Both the TRAC-FLVN a nd the TRAC-WSMR requirements are anticipated 100% small business set-asides.  Responses shall include company name, address, POC, phone number, fax number, email address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number and CAGE Code.  This noti ce is not a request for proposals and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation from the information received.  No contract award will be made on the basis of respons es received; however, the information will be used in NRCC-Ls assessment of capable sources.  Responses should be submitted by 2pm (Central Time) April 29, 2005.

<SUBJECT>A--SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO EVOLVING ARCHITECTURE FOR SPACE COMMUNICATIONS
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION. IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NASA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this information, but may release an RFP at a later date based on the need for this type of technology and its feasibility based upon the responses to this request for information (RFI).  This request is for information planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to provide information on related technologies.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit comments or questions to the identified point of contact, no later than May 6, 2005.  In responding, use reference RFI-NNC0500001L. This announcement is not tied to any scheduled or anticipated procurements at this time.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) solicits information and white papers on space qualifiable Software Defined Radio (SDR) evolving architectures and their associated technologies for space-based NASA applications.  The purpose of the RFI is to assess SDR architectures and core technology elements to determine an appropriate investment strategy to advance these technologies to meet future mission needs. NASA GRC seeks to advance the technologies of SDR architectures to enable advanced on-orbit frequency and waveform reconfigurability and programmability and increase data rate capability while reducing power, mass, and cost of SDRs for space communications.  Technologies of interest include: (1)Operating Environment Components:   •The Operating Environment (OE) consists of three software components:	Core Framework, and Middleware, and Real-Time Operating System. •Throughout this section it may be helpful to refer to Figure 1 which includes sample NASA space software defined resource allocations for each OE component. •Core Framework  1. Describe your core framework’s ability to be tailored to meet NASA space specific requirements for memory, power and performance.  Current COTS and open source core frameworks memory requirements are orders of magnitude larger than NASA space based core framework memory allocations. 2. Provide, as a minimum, the means for NASA to evaluate and/or gain access to Reduced Footprint Core Framework (RFCF) source software.  NASA desires the use of the RFCF (“CF Light”) examples for evaluation purposes. 3. NASA desires to dynamically allocate waveform resources across the platform but envisions a high cost for increased memory footprint required by XML processing and space qualifying multiple configuration deployments.	Responses are encouraged to suggest alternative designs, to XML processing, to support dynamic waveform resource allocation within their corresponding core framework. 4. If NASA decides to reduce or eliminates the requirement for dynamic waveform resource allocation describe how your core framework will continue to support portability, reconfigurability and scalability requirements. 5. Describe your plans to support stringent NASA flight verification requirements of OE components.   6. Document performance testing associated with your core frameworks’s overhead rates. 7. Document core framework memory footprint size in Kbytes per source language (C, C++).  8. Document processing or logic resources for any implementation in hardware devices. •Middleware 1.Discuss any middleware (e.g. CORBA ORBs, software buses, and messaging software) designed specifically for space based software defined radio.  Discuss standardization activities for any middleware recommendation.  2.NASA desires to maximize portability between processing elements and therefore is interested in ORBs (or other middleware implementations) that run on GPPs, DSPs as well as hardware processing devices (e.g. FPGAs).  Document your middleware capability to execute on a hardware device (e.g. FPGA and DSP) or future plans to execute on reconfigurable logic.   3.Document how CORBA vendors’ ORBs utilize shared memory when the space waveform application components reside on the same processor. 4.Document performance testing associated with your middleware’s overhead rates associated with its protocol layer communication between peer components. 5.Document middleware memory footprint size in Kbytes per source language (C, C++).    6.Document processing or logic resources for any implementation in hardware devices. •Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) 1.Describe how your RTOS meets POSIX AEP while not restricting resource limited environments common in space applications. 2.Describe how your RTOS meets POSIX AEP on a General Purpose Processor (GPP) and supports POSIX AEP minimum on a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). 3.Describe how your RTOS meets a minimum POSIX subset and while not using memory and performance resources associated with the unused POSIX subset. 4.Discuss RTOS certification to FIP 140-2 out of the box or plans to achieve. 5.Discuss RTOS certification to FAA DO-178B, out of the box, or plans to achieve Level A certification for reliability. 6.Document performance testing associated with your RTOS overhead rates. 7.Document RTOS memory footprint size in Kbytes per source language (C, C++).  8.Document processing or logic resources for any implementation in hardware devices. II. Response Requirements  The following information is requested in accordance with this RFI:  1.A description of related technologies and experience within your organization or company that would support the NASA technology needs as described above.  For each technology identified, provide a brief description of the technology and how it would support the NASA need. 2.Provide an assessment of the effort (schedule and ROM cost) required to raise the technology to a sufficient level to demonstrate the technology in the space environment.  Note other organizations funding the technology development or using the products intended for space applications. 3.Provide your assessment of the limiting factors to advance the core technologies to enable the characteristics and system architecture described above. 4.Responders may offer proprietary (marked as appropriate) evaluation products for NASA use in the interim.  NASA will provide white paper study results to responders on the technical findings of the evaluation products. Dependant on the negotiation of Nondisclosure Agreements (NDA’s) directly between the Responder and the on-site contractor, NASA may utilize on-site Contractors to review responses.  RESPONDERS ARE REQUESTED TO ARRANGE DIRECTLY WITH THE ON-SITE CONTRACTORS FOR NDA’S AS NECESSARY TO ALLOW FOR THIS REVIEW.	Contact points for the contractors are set forth in the attachment. NASA will review all responses evaluations,however, sufficient time to characterize performance will be needed.  Responders are encouraged to allow NASA to use their evaluation responses for 3-6 months.   5.Provide the name of a business and technical point of contact for your organization or company along with their phone number, e-mail address and mailing address. III. Submittal Instructions Respondents should address all the items in the order that they are listed in Section II to Tammy M. Blaser, NASA Glenn Research Center, 21000 Brookpark Road, MS 86-11, Cleveland, Ohio 44135, TEL: 216-433-2699, E-mail: tammy.m.blaser@nasa.gov.  NASA GRC would be pleased to meet with potential respondents to discuss this RFI or host contractor presentations at GRC related to this RFI. THIS RFI IS ISSUED SOLELY FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF MEETING AND REQUEST FOR INTEREST, ARMY CENTER FOR APPLIED BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY DAY
<DESC>Notice of Meeting & Request for Interest For Army Center for Applied Biotechnology Industry Day Purpose:  The U.S. Armys Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) is planning to hold an Industry Day on May 25, 2005 at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.  The purpose of this Industry Day is to assess the level of int erest from the commercial biotechnology industry, academia and other government agencies in forming a consortium with the U.S. Army to develop biotechnology-based solutions to a broad range of Army and DoD mission requirements.  Background:  Studies conducted by the National Research Council (NRC), the Director of Net Assessment in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD/NA) and the Army Materiel Command (AMC) have all identified biotechnology-related disciplines as core and c ritical enabling technologies for the Armys Future Force.  Further, the studies conducted by OSD/NA and NRC concluded that biotechnology has revolutionary potential for U.S. military capabilities and shared one overriding conclusion. The OSD/NA study (Exp loring Biotechnology: Opportunities for the Department of Defense, January 2002) stated this conclusion in the following manner: DoD needs to establish firm business ties to the commercial biotechnology community in order to develop the industrial base required for military capability production. The NRCs Committee on Opportunities in Biotechnology for Future Army Applications, sponsored by the Army, was established in 1999 to examine the military potential of relevant bioscience and engineering for applications to the future soldier.  The Committ ee identified important medical and non-medical applications for biotechnology focused on soldier survivability, sustainment, and performance enhancement.  Similar to the conclusion from the OSD/NA report, one of the overarching recommendations (Opportunit ies in Biotechnology for Future Army Applications) was:  The Army should adopt new approaches toward commercial developers to accommodate cultural differences between the government and the biotechnology industry This recommendation reinforced the recognition that, in order to bring the vast resources and ongoing research and development in biotechnology-related fields in industrial and academic institutions to bear on critical Army needs, a strong partnership with  both industry and academia is critical. In addition, the mechanism for implementing this partnership should be flexible and capable enough to embrace the full breadth of biotechnology-related activities. Recognizing the revolutionary potential of biotechnology for the Future Force, RDECOM established a Biotechnology Integrated Product Team (IPT) to focus current and future biotechnology R&D and  to build an integrated portfolio of biotechnology programs. Formation of the Biotechnology IPT was part of a larger effort by RDECOM to establish a set of IPTs representing each of the major technology areas that support AMCs materiel acquisition needs.  This action was taken in response to a recognized need to tr ansform its Science and Technology (S&T) business processes in accordance with the following tenets identified in its U.S. Army Materiel Command Transformation White Paper (July 2003): ·	To meet the needs of the Objective (and Future) Force, we must transform our science and technology business processes to get technology into the hands of the Soldier faster ·	The Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) will take a systems-of-systems perspective to help ensure that properly balanced trade-offs are made across individual systems and technologies so that systems will be optimized and integrated fo r performance within cost and schedule constraints Each of the IPTs is expected to coordinate needs and concomitant technology approaches across all of the engineering centers within AMC thus helping to address systems-related goals.  Through the use of these IPTs, the Command will build fully integrated portfolios of technology programs that support the Armys Force Operating Capabilities (FOCs). One of the first issues being taken on by the Biotechnology IPT is to respond to recommendations regarding the need for new approaches with which to engage the private sector.   The planned industry day will provide an opportunity to discuss the details of  a proposed consortium-based Center for Applied Biotechnology and to solicit feedback from participants from industry and academia as to their interest in joining with the Army in such an endeavor. Description:  The approach being taken is that of a consortium-based Center for Applied Biotechnology that leverages the experience and lessons learned in establishing and operating similar Army sponsored centers in a variety of other R&D application areas .  The latter include the National Small Arms Center, the Defense Ordinance Technology Center (formerly the Warhead and Energetics Technology Center), the Center for Optics Manufacturing and the National Defense Center of Environmental Excellence.  This or ganizational structure, employing an open partnering architecture, has demonstrated repeated success in creating a user friendly forum of academic, commercial and government partners. Membership in the consortium will be open to all interested U.S. companies, academic institutions and other organizations with the appropriate qualifications.  This consortium, operating in partnership with the Army, the Armys Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies and other government partners, will comprise the Armys Center for Applied Biotechnology.  The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) will administer the Center for the Army reporting to an Army Management Team led by  RDECOM.  While the administrative structure for the Center will be located at JHU/APL, it will, in essence, operate as a virtual center in that the actual work of the Center will be performed at the locations and utilizing the facilities of the various co nsortium members and/or Army and other government facilities as appropriate.   Funding for the Centers work will be project-driven, focusing on specific areas of need identified by the Centers team of partners from government, industry, and academia or that identified directly by other Army/DoD program offices or acquisition comman ds.  It is a goal of the Center to emphasize applied RDT&E activities that are beyond basic research (i.e., RDT&E categories 6.2  6.7, production engineering and OMA funded engineering, for example), are focused heavily on prototype and proof of concept s ystems development, and which therefore complement other ongoing basic research activities in biotechnology by offering transition mechanisms that more rapidly move toward operational implementations (i.e., getting the technologies into the hands of the So ldier faster).  Much of the work is expected to place a premium on teaming and partnerships made up of multiple consortium members working collaboratively on multi-disciplinary projects.  Examples of the range of different types of prospective Army applica tions include biomaterial-based camouflage and concealment; biological markers for combat identification; functional foods; health monitoring; gene-expression monitoring for performance enhancement; protein-based components leading to radiation-resistant e lectronics; genomics-based, directed therapies for soldier therapeutics; and engineered skin, tissue, organs and biomaterial-based dressings to curtail bleeding and accelerate wound healing.  Examples of some key technology focus areas to support these app lications include biomanufacturing, metabolic engineering, bioinformatics, biomaterials science, natural products biochemistry, molecular immunology, computational biology, and combinatorial biology.  These applications and technology focus areas are exemp lary only and not exclusive.    In order to  attract the broadest range of organizations and to be the most effective and efficient in carrying out the above objectives, the Army plans to utilize an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) as the primary funding vehicle for the Center (Sections 845 and 822  of the 1994 Defense Appropriations Act).  This will provide the flexibility to engage both members of the commercial biotechnology industry as well as academic organizations that do not normally work on DoD programs and it offers streamlined acquisition a pproaches for rapid, but controlled, technology transition.  A Consortium Management Agreement (CMA) will be developed and used to define the rules by which the consortium members are bound together and work, including such areas as how the members will ad dress intellectual property. Administrative Information:	If you would like to have a representative of your organization attend or if you have questions regarding the meeting, please submit your request/questions via e-mail to the following address:  		armybiotech.industryday@aplmsg.jhuapl.edu  Include in your request the names of proposed attendees (please limit to 2 per organization), a short description of the type of work and/or research and development that your organization is involved in (please keep to one page or less), and an e-mail add ress for notification regarding the acceptance status of your request.  Since seating space in the auditorium is limited, how well organizational qualifications described in the information provided match Army needs and IPT focus areas may be used to deter mine approval. The meeting will take place from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday, May 25, 2005 in the Parsons Auditorium at JHU/APL.  Previously registered attendees should check in outside the entrance to the auditorium.  A nominal fee will be charged for each attend ee in order to cover the cost of refreshments and snacks provided during the meeting.

Written document shall be generated, in duplicate, that itemizes any and all visible dents, dings, scratches or other damage and/or defects, as well as, providing an overall assessment of the operational condition of the rental vehicle.  This document or "inspection checklist" shall be signed by both inspecting parties and constitutes testament of the condition of vehicle rental at the time of delivery or pick-up by the Government.

The Government shall ensure an equal amount of fuel is present at return as was recorded at acceptance.  In the event the Government fails to do so, the Contractor agrees any charges to replace missing fuel shall be separate and apart from this contract, and is to be coordinated directly with the Government representative to make arrangement for payment of these charges by Government Credit Card.  Mileage incurred on the vehicle rentals will be recorded for informational purposes only.

16.  Refueling of vehicle rentals while in use under this contract shall be the responsibility of the Government (e.g., the Requiring Activity).

(b) If the Government terminates this contract in whole or in part under the Default-Fixed-Price Supply and Service clause, the Contractor is liable for liquidated damages accruing until the Government reasonably obtains delivery or performance of similar supplies or services.

(c) The Contractor will not be charged with liquidated damages when the delay in delivery or performance is beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor as defined in the Default-Fixed-Price Supply and Service clause in this contract.

Evaluation of Commercial Items:  The following evaluation criteria will be used to evaluate proposal submission:  (1) At least three or more previous experiences with shipping materials to Hawaii; (2) Lead time needed to purchase and ship materials, confirmation of the critical delivery of materials to Honolulu and Young Brothers by July 14, 2005; and the Offeror's ability to meet that date; (3) Capability to store materials in Honolulu identifying available storage facilities; and (4) transportation capability of delivery to Young Brothers for barge transport.  The evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance.  Award of any contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation will be based on best value to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.  Technical quality is significantly more important than cost or price.  Price will be a factor in the award decision, although the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  As the technical merit and evaluated cost or price becomes essentially equal, other factors may become the determining factor.  The Government reserves the right to make award without further discussion.  Proposals shall be submitted in an original and three copies by no later than 12:00 p.m. on May 5, 2005 to:  Historic Preservation Training Center, 4801A Urbana Pike, Frederick, Maryland  21704.

<DESC>The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Florida requires the services of a licensed registered land surveyor for the performance of legal boundary surveys in the State of Florida and is issuing a Request for Proposal.  This acquisition process is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subparts 12, 13 & 15.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541370.  

Description:  The Surveyor must be a licensed registered land surveyor in the State of Florida.  The Surveyor will provide a Boundary Survey of the Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) Easement Area which meets the minimum technical standards for land surveying as set forth in Chapter 61G – 17, Florida Administrative Code, adopted pursuant to Section 472.027, Florida Statutes.   The Survey shall also meet the accuracy specifications and positional tolerances for a Rural Survey as set forth by the Florida Board of Professional Surveyors and Mappers.  The Survey shall include a sketch of the route of ingress and egress to a publicly dedicated right of way, and the legal description of the WRP Easement Area and the access route shall be by metes and bounds description.  The Surveyor will provide: (i) three (3) signed and sealed original Surveys (size 36x24) and two (2) signed and sealed original Surveys (size 11x17) to the WRP Coordinator; (ii) two (2) signed and sealed original Surveys (size 36x24) to the closing attorney designated by the WRP Coordinator; and (iii) one (1) copy of the Survey to the local District Conservationist.  The Surveyor may also be required to deliver a Survey to the landowner; provided, however, the Surveyor shall not release the Survey to the landowner or any other party without the approval of the WRP Coordinator.

The WRP Coordinator will provide the Surveyor with location maps of the WRP Easement Area and access route, written authorization for access to the WRP Easement Area, and such other descriptive information as may be available.  The closing attorney will provide the Surveyor with a Title Certificate including copies of the vesting deeds for the current landowner and the exception documents referenced therein.

The Survey shall include the name of the landowner and WRP contract number in its legend and shall include a reference to the Title Certificate and title documents provided by the closing attorney.  In addition to the Survey, the Surveyor will also provide separate legal descriptions of the WRP Easement Area as Attachment A and the access route as Attachment B.

Natural or manmade barriers, such as ditches, streams, creeks, bayous, or rivers are occasionally used as boundary lines in property descriptions.  In those instances, in property descriptions where boundary lines are called for as being located at or along the centerline of a ditch, stream, creek, bayou or river, for purposes of defining the WRP Easement Area, the Surveyor shall traverse along the top bank of such ditch, stream, creek, bayou, or river.  In those cases where property descriptions call for boundary lines to be located at or along a lake, for the purposes of defining the WRP Easement Area, the surveyor shall traverse along the top bank of such lake or in the absence of a top bank, the surveyor shall traverse along the mean high water elevation for the lake.  Questions regarding these traverses shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

The following certification will be included on each Survey:

THIS IS TO CERTIFY TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ACTING BY AND THROUGH THE COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, TITLE INSURANCE COMPANY, AND [ THE LANDOWNER ] :  (A) THAT THIS SURVEY WAS DONE BY THE UNDERSIGNED; (B) THAT THE SURVEY WAS DONE ON THE GROUND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MOST RECENT STANDARDS FOR PROPERTY BOUNDARY SURVEYS, AS SET FORTH BY THE STATE OF FLORIDA, BOARD OF REGISTRATION FOR PROFESSIONAL SURVEYORS AND MAPPERS; (C) THAT THE ACCURACY SPECIFICATION AND POSITION TOLERANCE ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH RURAL AREA SURVEYS; (D) THAT THIS SURVEY SHOWS ALL MATTERS ON THE GROUND WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT TITLE TO THE SUBJECT PROPERTY; (E) THAT INGRESS AND EGRESS TO THE SUBJECT PROPERTY IS PROVIDED BY ______________________, [ A PUBLICLY DEDICATED RIGHT OF WAY ] or [ A PRIVATE EASEMENT RIGHT ]; AND THE SUBJECT PROPERTY CONTAINS A TOTAL OF _______ ACRES, MORE OR LESS.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27. 

****The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all Responsible Parties may submit a quote.

****The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for two (2) YB66 Single Crystal Wafers to be used by NIST’s Ceramics Division in the ultra-high vacuum x-ray beamline X24A that is located at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS).  This monochromator uses a double crystal boomerang type design to obtain fixed exit, monochromatic beam over its entire energy range.  Before the monochromator, there is a vertically collimating circular mirror with a 1 kilometer radius, and after the monochromator there is a horizontally focusing cylindrical mirror.

The YB66 crystals shall operate inside the monochromator, and they shall be used to deliver monochromatic x-rays via Bragg diffraction from the “white” beam produced by the NSLS x-ray storage ring.
All interested parties shall provide a quote for the following line item:

****LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity of two (2) YB66 Single Crystal Wafers meeting the following required specifications:

**The YB66 crystals shall be oriented and cut to expose the (400) crystal plane as the crystal surface.  These planes shall have a 2d spacing of 11.72 angstroms because the energy range for which we intend to use the crystals is between 1 and 2 keV.  The crystals must be clean and ready for use in ultra-high vacuum;
**Each crystal must be 40 mm long and 20 mm wide.  The crystals must be a minimum of 1 mm thick, and both crystals must have the same thickness;
**The single-crystal quality of both crystals must be checked by the supplier by x-ray diffraction rocking-curve analysis, and this analysis must be supplied with the crystals.  The crystal rocking curves of both crystals shall have only a single peak across the entire surface of the crystal.  The width and theta value of the crystal rocking curves of both crystals must be identical to the test crystal across the entire surface of the crystal;
**The full width at half maximum of the crystal rocking curve for both crystals must translate to a resolution on X24A that is better than 0.25 eV at 1100 eV increasing monotonically to better than 1 eV at 2000 eV;
**X-ray topographic analysis of the crystals will be performed by NIST.  The x-ray topographs must demonstrate that the entire surface of both crystals diffracts at the same Bragg angle, and that the crystals are free of defects, such as twinning, grain structures, differences in lattice constant, fabrication damage (such as scratches, pits, and digs), etc., across their entire surfaces;
**The entire surfaces of both crystals must be homogeneous as revealed by x-ray topography (performed by NIST) and have a single peak in its x-ray diffraction rocking curve.  The entire surface will be mapped for each crystal by NIST.

****DELIVERY SHALL BE FOB DESTINATION and shall be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.  The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The Contractor shall deliver the crystals to NIST, Building 235, 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001.

****Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Quotations shall include the documentation (for example certificate of analysis) or other product literature, which CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated above.  In determining best value, the Government will give strongest consideration to: crystal quality. 
 
****Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service, provided by the Contractor.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on information obtained from the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/ or information provided by NIST or its affiliates.  Quoters shall provide a list of at least THREE (3) REFERENCES to whom the same or similar products have been sold.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number and email address of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed.

****Past Experience will be evaluated to determine the degree of the vendor’s experience in successfully providing comparable laser oscillators for the types of applications described herein.  Information on past experience may be obtained from references.

Statement of Work

Train Network Management System Development-- Technical Support for Demonstrations of Locomotive Emergency Egress, Locomotive Security System and Advanced Concept Train


Overview of Train Demonstrations— Locomotive Emergency Egress, Advanced Concept Train and Locomotive Security System

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Office of Research and Development proposes to build a five-car train to demonstrate new freight car technology systems that FRA has been developing during the past several years. The demonstration covers three areas from three separate program areas—Rolling Stock and Equipment, Train Occupant Protection and Train Security.  FRA has developed Emergency Egress concepts for locomotives. The roof hatch, removable windshield, detachable door hinge and the Automatic Collision Notification System were developed under the Train Occupant Protection Program to improve locomotive crew safety.  FRA proposes to demonstrate these concepts as part of the demonstrations.  The objective of the Advanced Concept Train (ACT) Project is to develop and demonstrate advanced systems for continuously monitoring and remotely controlling freight car mechanical components to improve freight rail transportation safety and efficiency. This includes the use of Electrically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) Braking.  The program is part of the Rolling Stock Program Element in FRA's Five-Year Strategic Plan for Railroad Research, Development and Demonstrations.  The Locomotive Security System (LSS) is part of the Train Security Program.  The objective of the LSS is to develop and demonstrate advanced concepts to prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives.

During FY 2003 FRA purchased an EMD GP40-3 EM2000 computer controlled locomotive for these projects.   FRA proposes to acquire five freight cars on loan from co-operating railroads for the Advanced Concept Train Demonstration projects. The five freight cars will be equipped with sensors to monitor the following components:

·	Bearings (vibration signature and temperature)
·	Trucks (ride quality and hunting)
·	Wheels (flat and out-of-round)
·	Brakes (piston travel)
·	Car Ride Quality (all three directions)

The freight cars will also be equipped with actuators to remotely control the following components:

·	Coupler
·	Cut-levers
·	Angle-cocks
·	Advanced cushioning device
·	Advanced handbrake

The FRA also plans to equip the ACT locomotive and freight cars with stand alone hard-wired AAR S-4200 compliant Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brakes.  FRA purchased New York Air Brake’s EP-60 ECP brakes along with locomotive CCB-II brakes to control braking. FRA also plans to upgrade the locomotive to provide locomotive systems for on-board monitoring for safe and efficient maintenance and operation. The ACT locomotive (GP-40-3) will be modified to incorporate a Locomotive Security System (LSS).

An IEEE 802-11b based two-way wireless intra-train communication system will link the freight cars to the locomotive. The communication system enables the freight cars to transmit safety alarms and status information to the locomotive and to receive commands and information requests from the locomotive. When a defect affecting train safety is detected, a safety alarm will be sent to the locomotive to alert the engineer.  Non-critical defects detected during normal operations are flagged and reported for maintenance. The freight car sensor data will also be linked to a remote database server through a wireless telecommunications system.  The database server will be accessible via the Internet.  FRA currently has five cars equipped with the on-board monitoring system operating in a revenue service demonstration in co-operation with Southern Company and Norfolk Southern Corporation.  The experience gained with that demonstration will be extended to the ACT.

Integrating Locomotive Display/Computer Systems with ECP Braking and the ACT Monitoring and Control System

FRA has reviewed available locomotive computer systems for use in the ACT Demonstration Project. The FRA GP-40-3 locomotive is an Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) built locomotive with the EM-2000 computer. The EMD Functionally Integrated Railway Electronics (FIRE) locomotive display and cab computer with integrated Communications Management Unit (CMU) and IntelliTrain remote monitoring system is uniquely qualified to support the FRA ACT project.  The FIRE locomotive display and cab computer is built on a Microsoft Windows embedded XP platform and is designed to operate in the locomotive cab environment.  The FIRE computer uses an EMD proprietary inter-process communication protocol known as NetCore, which is based on a TCP/IP network socket bus architecture.  The FIRE computer CMU supports numerous wireless communications technologies, including 1xRTT and GPRS packet switched cellular, CDMA circuit switched cellular, and 802.11b wireless LAN.  The FIRE computer integrated CMU and NetCore messaging protocol is employed to seamlessly exchange data between the locomotive and remote databases.  EMD has created a FIRE Developer’s Kit (FDK) that provides a set of tools to support development of third party applications for the FIRE locomotive display and cab computer. The FDK will facilitate development of software for the ACT demonstration.

In view of the above FRA is seeking a contractor to support the ACT development team in developing the necessary software and to provide related technical support to install the software on the locomotive FIRE computers installed on the FRA GP-40-3 locomotive. The required software and its function for each of the specific tasks are described in detail below:

TASKS

Task 1: Train Network Management System Development for Actuator Remote Control and On-Board Sensor Monitoring

a) Messaging Protocol Development for communication between the freight cars and the locomotive FIRE computer and locomotive applications 

The contractor shall support the ACT development team in developing a messaging system for two-way communication between the locomotive and the freight cars and between the locomotive and remote database servers.  The messaging system will be based on an open protocol such as Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS).  The messaging system software shall run on the FIRE computer to support operation of various graphical user interfaces for controlling advanced components and displaying monitoring system data and two-way messaging between the locomotive and the ACT freight cars.
b) Graphical User Interfaces on Locomotive FIRE computers
The contractor shall support the ACT development team in developing graphical user interfaces (GUI) on the FIRE computer to control the advanced components (hand brakes, cut levers, angle cocks, etc.) and display information from the passive monitoring system.
c) Transmitting OBMCS (sensor) data to web accessible database server
The contractor shall develop software for the locomotive FIRE computers to transmit car sensor data and pertinent locomotive data (locomotive health status, fuel data, asset tracking) to a web accessible database server when required. The On-Board Monitoring and Control System also provides a direct path to the web accessible database server.  The software shall use the messaging system developed in a).
d) ACT Hazard Analysis
The contractor shall provide engineering technical support to assist with conducting a hazard analysis of the ACT system, particularly the intra-train wireless communication system between the locomotive and the ACT freight cars.  A report describing the Hazard Analysis shall be written and submitted to the FRA.

Task 2:  Locomotive Security System

In recent times there has been a heightened concern about railroad security in the US.  One area of particular concern is the vulnerability of locomotives and trains to operation by unauthorized individuals and the potential use of a train as a terrorist weapon.  It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to stop a loaded train carrying hazardous material, going 70 MPH, in a populated urban area by any means other than by derailing it.  At the very least, this would result in significant property damage and be extremely disruptive to America’s railroad transportation system. FRA, has identified the risk of using a locomotive/train as a terrorist weapon and the unique challenge faced by the railroads to secure their locomotives and infrastructure.

Because many different personnel operate locomotives and they are often interchanged between railroads, locomotives are not equipped with an ignition key like an automobile.  Instead, locomotives are equipped with a universal removable "Reverser" handle that is mechanically interlocked with the locomotive "Throttle" handle.  The "Reverser" handle is inserted into a slot in the locomotive controller mechanism in order to operate the locomotive. Because the "Reverser" handle is designed to be interchangeable between locomotives, a lost, misplaced, stolen or duplicated "Reverser" handle could be used by an unauthorized individual to operate any standard freight or passenger locomotive in North America.  Locomotive cabs are also equipped with door locks, however they are seldom used, especially when the locomotives are being operated.  In any case, they would provide little protection against an armed terrorist determined to hijack a locomotive.

To address these security risks and prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives, FRA would like to develop and demonstrate a Locomotive Security System.  The system, as envisioned, would utilize electronic ID technology, such as SmartCards, to authenticate the identity of a certified locomotive engineer/operator.  If the operator fails to authenticate properly, a full service penalty brake would be initiated by the LSS to stop the train and prevent operation of the locomotive The contractor shall develop a prototype system for application to the FRA Advanced Concept Train Locomotive. The contractor shall provide technical support to install, test and verify operation of the LSS. 

Locomotive Security System Concept

The LSS, as envisioned, would use an electronic ID (e.g. smartcard) to prevent unauthorized operation of a locomotive.  In the basic embodiment of the system, authorized locomotive operators would be issued an electronic ID and their own unique PIN.  The PIN is encrypted so that the ID card can not be duplicated if lost or stolen.  The locomotive would be equipped with an electronic ID card reader and keypad.  The electronic ID card readerwould interface to the LSS computer.  The LSS computer would  prevent operation of the locomotive unless a valid PIN is entered by the locomotive operator. A functional discussion follows.

Each time the locomotive comes to a stop, the locomotive operator must enter his PIN before the LSS computer will allow the locomotive to be operated.  While the locomotive is moving, the locomotive operator must periodically enter his PIN.  If the locomotive operator fails to enter the correct PIN, the LSS computer will send a signal to the locomotive airbrake system to initiate a penalty brake application.  A penalty brake application will result in removal of locomotive traction power and the reduction of brake pipe pressure to zero psi at a service rate.  

An optional distress message can automatically be transmitted to alert authorities of unauthorized locomotive operation when an incorrect PIN is entered or when a special PIN is entered (e.g. backward PIN).

In another embodiment of this invention, operator biometric information (e.g. fingerprint) is stored on the electronic ID.  The locomotive is equipped with an electronic ID card reader and corresponding biometric scanner (e.g. fingerprint reader).  The operation is identical to that described above using a PIN to authenticate locomotive operation except that a biometric scan is conducted instead of a PIN being entered by the operator. Periodic reaffirmation can be incorporated with the ALERTER system. The handle may be equipped with a fingerprint scanner which will allow the locomotive engineer/operator continuing authentication. 

As part of this work, the FRA GP40-3 locomotive shall be equipped with an Electro-Motive FIRE™ Locomotive Cab Computer and Display (LCC&D).  FRA proposes to further utilize this locomotive to implement a prototype LSS with capabilities to use either a PIN or a fingerprint for operator authentication.

The proposed locomotive security system shall use an electronic ID card that contains the operator’s encrypted personal identification number (PIN) and fingerprint information.  The locomotive security system shall be integrated with the brake system.  The locomotive will be equipped with both an electronic ID card reader and a finger print scanner.  The FIRE™ computer shall be used to implement the LSS algorithms and for operator PIN input.  

The operator must insert his/her ID card into the electronic ID card reader and input his/her PIN, or place his/her index finger on the fingerprint scanner, before operating the locomotive.  If the operator does not enter the correct PIN, or the fingerprint authentication fails, the locomotive security system will initiate a full service penalty brake application.  During operation of the locomotive, the operator will be asked to periodically enter his/her PIN into the system or place their finger on the fingerprint scanner in order to prevent a penalty brake application from being activated by the LSS.

A task report describing the Locomotive Security System shall be prepared and delivered to FRA for review and comment. This report shall be revised and submitted for final distribution. The prototype hardware shall be delivered for installation and support provided for installation of the same.

Deliverables

Task Deliverables 

The contractor shall document and make available to FRA all applicable software developed as part of this work. The rights to use any proprietary software incorporated into the Train Network System shall be granted to the Government.  The deliverables for each task are listed with each task.
	
Final Report
The final report shall describe all work done under this project referencing individual task reports and other materials.  The final report shall be suitable for publication by the Government. An electronic version, in either MS Word or WordPerfect shall be delivered to the Government. This version shall include all figures and tables. Publication and distribution of all reports and other documents produced as a result of this effort is at the sole discretion of the U.S. Government.

Instead, locomotives are equipped with a universal removable "Reverser" handle that is mechanically interlocked with the locomotive "Throttle" handle.  The "Reverser" handle is inserted into a slot in the locomotive controller mechanism in order to operate the locomotive. Because the "Reverser" handle is designed to be interchangeable between locomotives, a lost, misplaced, stolen or duplicated "Reverser" handle could be used by an unauthorized individual to operate any standard freight or passenger locomotive in North America.  Locomotive cabs are also equipped with door locks, however they are seldom used, especially when the locomotives are being operated.  In any case, they would provide little protection against an armed terrorist determined to hijack a locomotive.

To address these security risks and prevent unauthorized operation of locomotives, FRA would like to develop and demonstrate a Locomotive Security System.  The system, as envisioned, would utilize electronic ID technology, such as SmartCards, to authenticate the identity of a certified locomotive engineer/operator.  If the operator fails to authenticate properly, a full service penalty brake would be initiated by the LSS to stop the train and prevent operation of the locomotive The contractor shall develop a prototype system for application to the FRA Advanced Concept Train Locomotive. The contractor shall provide technical support to install, test and verify operation of the LSS. 

Locomotive Security System Concept

The LSS, as envisioned, would use an electronic ID (e.g. smartcard) to prevent unauthorized operation of a locomotive.  In the basic embodiment of the system, authorized locomotive operators would be issued an electronic ID and their own unique PIN.  The PIN is encrypted so that the ID card can not be duplicated if lost or stolen.  The locomotive would be equipped with an electronic ID card reader and keypad.  The electronic ID card readerwould interface to the LSS computer.  The LSS computer would  prevent operation of the locomotive unless a valid PIN is entered by the locomotive operator. A functional discussion follows.

Each time the locomotive comes to a stop, the locomotive operator must enter his PIN before the LSS computer will allow the locomotive to be operated.  While the locomotive is moving, the locomotive operator must periodically enter his PIN.  If the locomotive operator fails to enter the correct PIN, the LSS computer will send a signal to the locomotive airbrake system to initiate a penalty brake application.  A penalty brake application will result in removal of locomotive traction power and the reduction of brake pipe pressure to zero psi at a service rate.  

An optional distress message can automatically be transmitted to alert authorities of unauthorized locomotive operation when an incorrect PIN is entered or when a special PIN is entered (e.g. backward PIN).

In another embodiment of this invention, operator biometric information (e.g. fingerprint) is stored on the electronic ID.  The locomotive is equipped with an electronic ID card reader and corresponding biometric scanner (e.g. fingerprint reader).  The operation is identical to that described above using a PIN to authenticate locomotive operation except that a biometric scan is conducted instead of a PIN being entered by the operator. Periodic reaffirmation can be incorporated with the ALERTER system. The handle may be equipped with a fingerprint scanner which will allow the locomotive engineer/operator continuing authentication. 

As part of this work, the FRA GP40-3 locomotive shall be equipped with an Electro-Motive FIRE™ Locomotive Cab Computer and Display (LCC&D).  FRA proposes to further utilize this locomotive to implement a prototype LSS with capabilities to use either a PIN or a fingerprint for operator authentication.

The proposed locomotive security system shall use an electronic ID card that contains the operator’s encrypted personal identification number (PIN) and fingerprint information.  The locomotive security system shall be integrated with the brake system.  The locomotive will be equipped with both an electronic ID card reader and a finger print scanner.  The FIRE™ computer shall be used to implement the LSS algorithms and for operator PIN input.  

The operator must insert his/her ID card into the electronic ID card reader and input his/her PIN, or place his/her index finger on the fingerprint scanner, before operating the locomotive.  If the operator does not enter the correct PIN, or the fingerprint authentication fails, the locomotive security system will initiate a full service penalty brake application.  During operation of the locomotive, the operator will be asked to periodically enter his/her PIN into the system or place their finger on the fingerprint scanner in order to prevent a penalty brake application from being activated by the LSS.

A task report describing the Locomotive Security System shall be prepared and delivered to FRA for review and comment. This report shall be revised and submitted for final distribution. The prototype hardware shall be delivered for installation and support provided for installation of the same.

Deliverables

Task Deliverables 

The contractor shall document and make available to FRA all applicable software developed as part of this work. The rights to use any proprietary software incorporated into the Train Network System shall be granted to the Government.  The deliverables for each task are listed with each task.

<DESC>Amendment 0002 is issued to change the Closing Date from 04 May 2005 to 26 April 2005.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-05-R-625615 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 721110.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain its best terms.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation is hereby amended to extend the response date to May 2, 2005 at 12:00 pm (EST), and to answer the following contractor questions:
1.)  Items 1) d) and 2) d) the accuracy is stated as 0.02 FSR. Is 0.02 2% 
or is it 0.02%?
Answer: 1.d.1)d) and 1.d.3)d) both contain typographic omissions.  They should read:
"0.02% FSR".  If the FSR is 10 amps; the measurement accuracy requirement would be (0.0002)(10A) = 0.002A = 2mA.  
 2.)  Also what do you mean by FSR? I assume it is Full 
Scale Range; however, what is Full Scale Range of a 2 A channel? Is it 2 A or 4 Amps (-2 Amps to +2 Amps)? 
Answer: "FSR" means Full Scale Range.  The FSR for a two-amp channel is two amps magnitude (absolute value), but the channel must be capable of measuring from two amps positive (+2A) to two amps negative (-2A) as with a common digital multimeter.  The digital range is two amps and polarity is indicated separately.
3.) Does the equipment need to be off the shelf or will a custom solution be acceptable?
Answer: The desired equipment is expected to be a custom combination of identifiable "off the shelf" modules that have been proven in other applications.  "Off the shelf" modules of a design that has provided reliable service in previously built equipment will have a record of performance and reliability.  The time permitted for delivery of the desired equipment is not sufficient to prove the reliability of a completely custom design.  A modular design will also better facilitate maintenance and repair.  In a modular design, if one channel requires repair, it should not force the entire piece of equipment to be idle until repairs are completed
4.) Do you have a price history for subject item?
Answer: No
5.) Has this item been manufactured before?
Answer: Yes and No.  Yes, battery test equipment which will perform all of the functions specified for the subject equipment has been manufactured before.   No, not all of the desired functions are available in one existing unit as presently known to the Government.
 
Some existing battery test equipment can perform some of the functions of the desired equipment; other existing test equipment can perform other functions.  We are not aware of any battery test equipment which performs all of the desired functions and which has been built as one unit.  For example, battery test equipment is available which can charge and measure the capacity of lead acid, nickel cadmium, and nickel metal hydride batteries, but it does not handle smart batteries and it cannot monitor the performance of an external charger.  Other battery test equipment has been built to perform tests on many different kinds (battery technologies), but a special holder for each technology (or even size --AAA, AA, D, coin, etc.) may be required and the data cannot be ported to a spread sheet program such as Excel for plotting as charging and discharging curves. 
 
The desired system is intended for testing as wide a variety of batteries as possible at a reasonable cost, for teaching FDA regulatory staff about battery technology, and for conducting research in battery, fuel cell, and super capacitor applications to medical devices.

<DESC>Questions and Answers: 1.  Will the master station be a handheld (limited resource) machine or will it be a Laptop/Desktop workstation  A:  It will be a laptop or desktop computer running a Windows OS, probably Windows 2000 (the required OS for BRCCS) but potentially XL. 2.  What kind and where would the query for reports processing take place?  On the PDA or at Master station? A:  Queries will be pulled by an administrator or manager from the master station. 3.  Will the SF44 form and the entered data need to be translated or only the Form itself? A:  The form itself. 4.  Is the demo that is to take place one week after award to be the full application or a proof of concept? A:  Proof of concept, enough to show that the offeror has the capability to complete the design. 5.  What are the validation criteria for items 1-5? A:  The user will be able to type free text in the form to store and print this information.  The application will ideally remember and store the data like an auto fill application, so proper names of people and places are easily recalled when reused.  Dat es should auto format to DDMMMYY format and currency symbols should default to US$, with options to set default to other currencies. 6.  Will the schema for the PD2 database be available to the offeror? A:  No, as the output from the SF 44 application must be in XML file, this is not seen as necessary. 7.  Will a BRCCS laptop be supplied to the offeror for integration development.  If not, what is the technology and methodology required for integrating to PD2/BRCCS and how will the offeror be able to test the integration? A:  The government will be responsible for testing the integration with PD2. 8. The requirement is for software to be used on handheld computer.  Does this refer to a PDA, tablet, mini notebook or computerized telephone, some of these or all? A:  Handheld computer such as PDA or tablet PC running COTS OS such as Windows CE. 9. Are you seeking a GOTS or COTS, or neither.  Does the quick turnaround time indicate that something off the shelf is expected? A:  Product may be GOTS or COTS but to our knowledge no one has previously developed the SF 44 for field use.  The baseline system should be readily-installable without compromising the OS. 10. Are printer specs available, or generic any mini-printer intended? A:  Intent is for generic mini-printer.  Services will choose printers to meet their needs. 11.  Given the need to fill in scope specifics, is it possible to get an extension on the submission deadline? A:  Based on feedback received thus far from potential offerors, that is not necessary. 12. What are the validation criteria for user name? A:  User can enter a text name up to 25 characters. 13. What are the validation criteria user ID #? A:  User can enter a text ID up to 10 characters. 14. What are the validation criteria for Vendor Name? A:  User can enter a text name up to 25 characters. 15.
