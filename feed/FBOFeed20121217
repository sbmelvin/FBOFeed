<p>Period of Performance: 01/07/2013 to 09/07/2013</p>
<p>The final video-based communication products, given that they will be created in both English and Navajo languages, are best developed by native speakers which creates the need for fluency in both languages. Dine College already has an established relationship with the Navajo Tribal Government which saves valuable time that would be lost by bringing in an outside vendor because the Navajo are a sovereign nation and as such would require Tribal Council approval for the project. Gaining tribal council approval can take a considerable amount of time. Relationship building and trust are already established with Tribal Colleges and Universities like Dine College, making them the most logical partner. Beyond that, it's important to remember the initial hantavirus outbreak in 1993 occurred primarily on the Navajo Reservation. Navajo students in the course, who live on the Reservation, are well-positioned to conduct interviews on sensitive topics, like loss of family members to the disease, in either Navajo or English, depending on the interviewee, which can add significantly to the public health impact of the finished videos.</p>
<p><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to Michael Harwell, Contracting Specialist, Reference 200-2013-M-54103, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, ATTN: Michael Harwell, MS: K14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government for future acquisitions. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov prior to an award of a federal contract.</p>

Description
Pursuant to U.S.C. 8127 (d), Entitled "Veterans First Program" the NCO 10 will be soliciting for a Competitive 100% Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Best Value Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) at the:
Chillicothe VA Medical Center, 17273 State Route 104, Chillicothe, OH 45601;
Cincinnati VA Medical Center, 3200 Vine Street, Cincinnati, OH 45220;
Cleveland VA Medical Center, 10701 East Boulevard, Cleveland, OH 44106; and the
Dayton VA Medical Center, 4100 W. Third Street, Dayton, OH 45428.
The type of work involved is geared towards a Multi disciplined SDVOB's general contractor.  The VA will not be awarding IDIQ contracts based upon individual disciplines; i.e. HVAC or electrical etc.   
Individual task order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and design capabilities (including design/build ranging from concept up to 100% level of effort and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction.  Typical work includes, but is not be limited to: interior and exterior renovations, heating and air-conditioning, HVAC controls, plumbing, fire suppression, interior and exterior electrical and lighting, fire and intrusion alarms, communications, limited utilities, site-work, landscaping, fencing, masonry, roofing, concrete, asphalt paving, storm drainage, limited environmental remediation, construction of new facilities, and other related work.  Work disciplines noted are geared towards general contractors (GC's).  All will be in accordance with individual task order requirements, specifications and drawings provided with each project or master specifications.

Task order limits will be $2,000 to $100,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish minor design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner.  The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $4.5M over a five-year period.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.  Prospective contractors must be able to respond within 120 minutes (2 hours) in response to emergencies via the main office or a staffed satellite office.  Note:  The 120 minutes (2 hours) emergency response means the contractor must be prepared to start addressing the emergency, with staff, tools, materials, and equipment as necessary.
Work to be performed under the MAJOCC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $33.5M. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects.  The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement/removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, and paving.  Offers are solicited only from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) business concerns that are expressly certified as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220. 

A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Veterans Administration Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) Subpart 815.3--Source Selection procedures - Best Value Trade off Process targeted specifically toward competitive SDVOSB's with a 30-day response time (offers due 30 days after issuing).  In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to three (3) IDIQ contracts, per VAMC, to those Offerors who give the Veterans Health Administration the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements for construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects.  The solicitation will include a seed project that will be used to evaluate these requirements.  The seed project magnitude is $25,000 to $100,000.00.

The Best Value is the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered, and consistent with the Government's stated importance of evaluation criteria.  This may result in award being made to a high-rated, higher-priced offeror where the Contracting Officer determines that the Past Performance and Technical capability of the higher-priced offeror outweighs the cost difference.  The three highest rated offers from the source selection, per VAMC, will receive basic contract award (up to 3).  The best value rated offer will be awarded the seed project subject to availability of funds.  All contractors receiving award will receive a not-to-exceed $1000 task order for the MATOC to satisfy the contract minimum requirement. These contracts will be issued as direct awards by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO 10), 3140 Governor's Place Blvd. - Suite 210, Kettering, OH 45409.

The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about February 2013 and close on or about April 2013. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation.

<DESC>This NRA solicits research proposals from Principal Investigators from U.S. institutions to conduct investigations in two distinct themes, Complex Fluids and Macromolecular Biophysics, aboard the International Space Station. The solicitation (NRA NNH13ZTT001N), entitled "Research Opportunities in Complex Fluids and Macromolecular Biophysics," will be available on or about December 21, 2012. The solicitation will be found by opening the NASA Research Opportunities homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/    and then linking through the menu listings "Solicitations" to "Open Solicitations." NASAs physical sciences research activities have been guided by recommendations from the National Research Council (NRC). The 2011 NRC Decadal Survey report, Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New Era, recommended a set of high priority areas in Fundamental Physics including complex fluids and soft condensed matter. In addition, the 2003 NRC report, Assessment of Directions in Microgravity and Physical Sciences Research at NASA, also recommends microgravity research in this area. To address these recommendations, this NRA solicits Complex Fluids research proposals from Principal Investigators from U.S. institutions to participate in the Advanced Colloids Experiment (ACE) test series; this is the first theme. The ACE will observe the behavior of colloidal systems using a microscope in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station. By performing soft-condensed matter experiments in a microgravity environment, scientists have been able to remove the masking effects of sedimentation, convection, and particle jamming in a timescale not available on Earth. The intent of ACE is to observe colloidal processes, to understand them, and to learn how to control them. For the second theme, this NRA solicits macromolecular biophysics research proposals from Principal Investigators from U.S. institutions to conduct experiments using the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) and any of the related hardware being developed for the ACE test series, including confocal microscopy. These LMM experiments will observe the mass transport and crystal growth behavior of biological macromolecules on the International Space Station. Removing or greatly reducing the effects of buoyancy-driven convection and sedimentation in microgravity, results in slower, diffusion-controlled molecular transport that can yield larger crystals with fewer defects. This allows for easier molecular structure determination using techniques such as X-ray diffraction. Research areas of particular interest include: transport phenomena in solutions of biological macromolecules, aggregation, nucleation, crystallization and the resultant crystal quality. One important goal of these macromolecular experiments is to determine the fundamental mechanisms governing mass transport and crystal growth. Proposals submitted in response to this NRA will use a two-step process. Proposers must show a clear connection between their proposed activities and the research emphases outlined in the NRA. Only PIs submitting Step-1 proposals determined to be relevant to the solicited research of this NRA will be invited to submit full Step-2 proposals. Step-1 proposals will be due on or around February 6, 2013, and Step-2 proposals will be due on or around April 10, 2013. Proposals must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization. Proposals must be submitted electronically. Step-1 proposers can use either NSPIRES (see URL above) or Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov     ) for proposal submission. Invited Step-2 proposals must be submitted electronically via the NSPIRES proposal data system. All categories of U.S. institutions are eligible to submit proposals in response to this NRA. Principal Investigators (PIs) may collaborate with investigators from universities, Federal Government laboratories, the private sector, state and local government laboratories and other countries. Collaborative proposals from U.S. institutions that include international participation are eligible, provided NASA policies regarding the conduct of research with non-U.S. organizations are met.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Center for Nanoscale Science &amp; Technology (CNST), intends to negotiate with Toptica Photonics Inc.; Victor, NY, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to purchase two TA PRO laser diode/tapered amplifier systems.
<p>The Electron Physics Group in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology at NIST requires laser diode systems to perform research on high brightness ion sources for focused ion beam applications based on laser cooling. This research supports the CNST's mission to develop new measurement tools that enable critical applications of nanotechnology in the Nation's economy. Diode laser systems provide a very cost effective means to produce the required laser power with the necessary continuous wave (CW) stability, narrow linewidth and tunability to both laser cool atoms and ions and also ionize cold atoms. The proposed acquisition will enable new developments in barium ion sources and cesium ion sources.</p>
<p>The laser diode systems will be used in laser cooling and ionization of cold atoms. High power is required because the laser light will be frequency-doubled in existing systems that require high power for good efficiency. NIST requires a tunable diode laser system that operates in continuous wave (CW) mode for use in laser-cooling of barium ions. In particular, NIST requires a master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) consisting of a tunable, single-frequency external cavity diode laser (ECDL) that is amplified by a tapered amplifier (TA) diode laser. The system is modular in construction and it will be necessary to exchange modules between laser systems during the course of operation. The system needs to have interchangeable parts with existing Toptica laser systems currently in use at NIST. This notice follows Sources Sought notice AMD-13-SS09, which was posted on Federal Business Opportunities on November 29, 2012. Market research has shown that Toptica Photonics Inc. is the only company that can provide laser diode systems that meet the requirements.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a Size Standard of 500 employees. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Toptica Photonics Inc. for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Eric Bubar at eric.bubar@nist.gov. All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted so that they are received at eric.bubar@nist.gov no later than December 26, 2012 at 5:00 pm.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Korea University Research for the purchase of support service to develop procedures, algorithms, and software tools for an equation of state based on the UNIFAC (universal functional activity coefficient) predictive model, for the assessment of vapor-liquid equilibria on the basis of experimental data stored in the NIST SOURCE Data Archival System and other relevant sources under other than full and open competition.
<p>NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br />(2) Only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Sole Source determination is based on the following: Prof. Jeong Won Kang is the only known source that has all the required technical knowledge, skills and abilities, specifically an expert-level familiarity with the NIST SOURCE archival system for thermophysical property data and an expert-level familiarity with NIST Standard Reference Database 103b (NIST ThermoData Engine).. As a result, Korea University Research is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>

Drawing and Specification Format:  

Intent:  The Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System shall be making all contract documents available to bidders on the web site.  By doing so it is anticipated that a wider exposure to potential project work shall result in savings for the government, and increase the efficiency of project delivery.

Requirements:  All contract drawings shall be provided to the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System in both AutoCAD (.dwg) format (release 2004 or higher) and CALS (.cal) format for all design submissions and for final construction documents.  The CALS driver is an AutoDesk raster printer driver and is a built-in feature of AutoCAD 2004. This CALS driver is used by AutoCAD to convert all vector drawings into raster images (black & white) to be used for possible electronic bidding by the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System.  This raster format can then be viewed and printed by ANY potential bidder by first downloading the free FastBid Index client viewer at www.fastbid.goe.to .  The Contractor must ensure that ALL drawing information is clearly defined in the CALS format, since solid fills with lines in the middle and layers with different percent masking are NOT printed in color and certain features are lost when printing in raster format.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor to require ALL of their consultants to follow these guidelines, to ensure ALL contract drawings are clearly legible in this new electronic bidding climate.

<DESC><p>The Department of Energy (DOE) is pursuing a sole source contract with Michael D. Holland Consulting for technical services under FAR 6.302-1, One Responsible Source. The approximate contract period of performance is January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. The estimated level of effort is 480 hours for the base year, with no option years included. The estimate of the cost for the base year is $80,000 plus DOE authorized travel expenses.</p>
<p>The work areas that the contractor is responsible to perform include translating recently identified B3019 security concerns and potential organizational and mission related vulnerabilities into actionable and corrective federal measures. Such services will include, but not be limited to, reviewing recent DOE investigations and reports related to B3019 security concerns, supporting DOE's preparation of the Corrective Action Plan (CAP), and presenting results to senior leadership within the Department. One such recent report contains classified information that requires assistance from individual(s) with appropriate need to know and security clearance(s) at the Q level. Additionally, this work requires substantial and unique understanding of DOE's roles and responsibilities, particularly as they relate to its locations and federal organizations within Oak Ridge, TN. Accordingly, DOE intends to use these services to assist in the determination of appropriate corrective measures, to assist in oversight and verification of the corrective action implementation, and otherwise advise senior DOE leadership in related matters. In establishing the minimum requirements for this effort, DOE identified the following criteria deemed essential to meet its requirements:</p>
<p>1) Immediate availability.<br />2) Experience demonstrating an understanding of SC's management structure and culture.<br />3) Experience demonstrating an understanding of the Office of Science management approach including its use of the Office of Science Management System (SCMS).<br />4) Experience demonstrating an understanding of the detailed roles, responsibilities, authorities and accountabilities of Office of Science Site Offices and Support Offices.<br />5) Experience demonstrating an understanding of project management systems with regard to organizational structure, schedules, resource requirements, and integration.<br />6) Possess a working knowledge of DOE Human Resources including incentives.<br />7) Experience in working with organizations to solve cultural issues.<br />8) Possess a working knowledge of the DOE security requirements, including and specifically those for Level 1 Safeguarded Facilities.<br />9) Experience demonstrating knowledge of DOE contracts.<br />10) Independence from any of the federal line management organizations supporting the security function for B3019 (i.e. had not previously served in a permanent position).<br />11) Possessed a DOE Q clearance within the past year.<br />12) Recent experience (no more than one year removed) managing a large SC Management and Operating Contract.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this award is 41 USC 253(c)(1), and implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Michael D. Holland Consulting has highly specialized personnel who are uniquely qualified to perform this requirement in accordance with the above stated criteria deemed necessary to accomplish this work. Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered by January 1, 2013 to: Mr. Brandon Whittier, Contract Specialist, 9800 South Cass Avenue, Argonne, Illinois 60439, or via email to brandon.whittier@ch.doe.gov. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 541611. Businesses who believe they have a superior solution to DOE's proposed award to Michael D. Holland Consulting must respond in writing to the Contract Specialist.</p>
<p>The written response must include a general technical proposal for performing services mentioned in this announcement, past performance client information for similar work within 3 years, resumes of individuals with relevant professional qualifications who would be potentially assigned to the work and a rationale as to why your solicitation would be in the Government's best interest. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><br />The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Technology Applications Contracting Office (TAKO), intends to award a contract for Data Concentrator Unit Engineering Services to SCI Technology, 13000 S Memorial Pkwy. Huntsville, AL. Inspection and acceptance is at Destination and Origin. Shipments will be FOB Destination to Fort Eustis, VA and Lexington, KY. The reference number is H92241-13-R-0002. The associated NAICS code is 334111 and small business standard is 1000 employees. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority FAR.6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). SCI Technology is the only qualified source for Data Concentrator Unit PN: 5443000-002. SCI Technology's DCU is the only component flight qualified for Army Special Operations Aircraft (ARSOA). The Government does not possess and cannot furnish the technical data required to develop engineering descriptions, technical data packages, or specifications necessary to permit full and open competition. Use of another source would entail cost that would not be recouped through competition. No request for quotes/proposals will be posted. Interested sources may identify interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government will review and consider all capabilities statements or proposals received within the closing date set in this notice. The Government retains the sole discretion on the decision whether or not to conduct a competitive competition based upon information received in response to this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The point of contact (POC) for this effort is Ms. Heather M. Linzy (heather.m.linzy.civ@mail.mil).<br />

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).    (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<CONTACT>Chris J. Anglin, Branch Chief, Aerial Networks, Phone 7812254957, Email chris.anglin@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to assist the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Space, Aerial &amp; Nuclear Networks Division (HNA), Gateways/Tactical Data Links (TDL) Branch (HNAG) in determining industry's interest and capability in satisfying the M-CWCT requirements and to improve upon the Government's Common Data Link (CDL) Waveform test capability. Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.
<p>The Government is seeking to procure portable test stations that are fully capable of reporting on a CDL terminal's compliance with CDL waveform specifications beyond those defined in Standard CDL (STD-CDL) waveforms. CDL waveforms are specifically being developed for supporting higher capacity data links and are Net-Centric Internet Protocol capable. Government test organizations require portable and modular test equipment for determining if CDL Terminals containing one or more of a family of CDL waveforms in either Unit Under Test (UUT) or in a System Under Test (SUT) configuration are compliant with CDL waveform specifications. The M-CWCT will be used to ensure CDL systems are capable of providing seamless real-time connectivity/interoperability between multiple Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) collection platforms.</p>
<p>The Government is considering a cost-effective acquisition strategy to procure portable CDL test stations. This approach would require developer of the M-CWCT to incorporate CDL waveform components provided as Government Furnished Material (GFM) into the M-CWCT design. The waveform components would be made available in the form of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Intellectual Property (IP) Cores. These GFM IP cores would be developed by a Government sponsored Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) and third party commercial IP vendors. The M-CWCT would host the GFM IP Cores using an open standard specification for common interfaces, Open Core Protocol (OCP), to communicate between waveform components and system interconnects. The GFM IP Cores would also be accompanied by comprehensive technical user documentation, system integration documents, and test guides.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement for acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.
All eligible and qualified contractors may submit capability statements for consideration. Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the quantity and availability of contractors who have the technical level of expertise, administrative, and management capabilities to perform the effort described below.  The capability statements received will also be used to determine the Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) overall procurement strategy.
Purpose 
Reclamation is looking for qualified sources with experience to perform an aquifer assessment and hydrogeological profile of a potential habitat restoration site near Blythe, CA.  
Reclamation needs to know what quantity of water can be produced from each developed borehole. In addition, the water quality must be assessed by analyzing water samples for pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature.
Background
The Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program (LCR MSCP) is a joint Federal, State (Arizona, California, and Nevada) program to assure that the water and power operations, both present and future, of Reclamation's Lower Colorado Region are in compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  The LCR MSCP partnership intends to accomplish this through the implementation of the 50-year program that shall move covered, threatened and endangered species toward recovery.  Reclamation is the implementing agency for the LCR MSCP Steering Committee.
Part of the program's goal is to establish habitat along the Lower Colorado River for the benefit of LCR MSCP covered species.  The Palo Verde South Ecological Reserve Area (PVER South) was identified for assessment of its habitat viability which includes creating ponds and planting cottonwood-willow-honey mesquite.  Understanding and quantifying the aquifers characteristics below PVER South is a critical element in the design of ponds dedicated to native fishes.  A portion of PVER South is currently under private ownership.   
Under this effort, the successful contractor shall be responsible for providing aquifer assessment and recommendations to support the planning and creation of ponds within the PVER South Area.   Specifically, groundwater wells have been identified as a viable source of "non-native fish" free water to maintain water surface elevations and exchange water to maintain the ponds within acceptable water quality parameters.  The collection of data from borings and the development of pilot holes are intended to allow us to determine the aquifers characteristics which are essential in the design, sizing, and long-term operation of the ponds in relative isolation from non-native fishes. 
Responses
Responsible sources are invited to submit a capability statement on or before 4:00 P.M., local time, Monday, December 24, 2012.  Received submittals will be reviewed and considered by Reclamation during the solicitation planning process.  Please send your capability package by email to Mr. Andre D. Desima, Contract Specialist at ADesima@usbr.gov.  Your package should include the following information:
1. Capability Statement - showing availability of performance and estimated lead time for performing the work 2. Business Name - including address, point of contact, phone number and email address 3. Business Size & Type - 8(a), HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business or Large Business. Firms should also identify whether or not they are a small business or other than small business in accordance with the size standard for (NAICS) Code 237110 (Water and Sewer Line and Related Structures Construction). The size standard is $33.5 million.  Responsive Vendors may provide recommendation for use of an alternate NAICS code.
For questions, contact Mr. Andre D. Desima, Contract Specialist at ADesima@usbr.gov, or contact Ms. Mona Jill West at MWest@usbr.gov.
Respondents are advised that Reclamation is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this Sources Sought.  Responses are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this announcement.
If it is determined that a formal solicitation will be issued, a Pre-solicitation Notice or Combined Synopsis shall be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.

<DESC><strong>Introduction.</strong> This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding <em><strong>(1)</strong></em> the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; <em><strong>(2)</strong></em> whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; <em><strong>and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)</strong></em> their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.
<p>Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Background.</strong> The National Institution of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) was deeded the South Campus location on June 26, 1967, by the Research Triangle Foundation. The NIEHS has only a proprietary interest in this land. This in effect means that although the Federal Government (NIEHS) has acquired title to this area in North Carolina, it has not obtained any measure of the State's authority over the area. This finding mandates that all contractors operating on all NIEHS property, leased or owned, in Durham County must adhere to all state and local requirements (i.e. building permits, etc.). The NIEHS is one of the National Institute of Health (NIH), principal federal agency for biomedical research on the health effects of environmental agents.</p>
<p>The NIEHS, located in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina, is one of 27 research institutes and centers that comprise the NIH, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).</p>
<p>The NIEHS traces its roots to 1966, when the U.S. Surgeon General announced the establishment of the Division of Environmental Health Sciences with the NIH. In 1969, the division was elevated to full NIH institute status. Since then, the NIEHS has evolved to its present status as a world leader in environmental health sciences. Today the NIEHS is expanding and accelerating its contributions to scientific knowledge of human health and the environment, and to the health and well-being of people everywhere.</p>
<p>The mission of the NIEHS is to reduce the burden of human illness and disability by understanding how the environment influences the development and progression of human disease. The NIEHS achieves its mission through; <em><strong>(1)</strong></em> Extramural research and training, funded by grants and contracts, to scientists, environmental health professionals, and other groups worldwide; <em><strong>(2)</strong></em> Intramural research conducted by scientist at the NIEHS facility and in partnership with scientists at universities and hospitals; <em><strong>(3)</strong></em> Toxicological testing and test validation by the National Toxicology Program (NTP); <em><strong>and (4)</strong></em> Outreach and communications programs that provide reliable health information to the public and scientific resources to researchers.</p>
<p>The Office of Communications &amp; Public Liaison (OCPL) is the first source of news and information about the NIEHS, and the institute's important biomedical research and funding programs. The communications team handles media requests, inquiries from the scientific community, as well as internal communication activities.</p>
<p>A critical component of an effective NIEHS research effort hinges on an in-depth understanding and demonstrated ability, by the multi-media contractor, for producing products that successfully communicate highly technical science and public health programs to both scientific and lay public audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives.</strong> The NIEHS, Office of Communications and Liaison (OCPL) is in need of support of graphic arts, desktop publishing, photography, and videography needs of the institute.</p>
<p>The NIEHS is exploring alternatives to providing graphic arts, desktop publishing, photography, and videography needs to the institute.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is for the contractor to provide personnel, equipment, materials, and professional expertise to plan, analyze, and create visual and audio accurate representations of highly scientific subject matters.</p>
<p>The overall objective and/or task of the Contractor will be communicating biomedical research methods, processes, and results in print, electronic, and video media, using a variety of methods from simple line art illustration to the most current digital techniques using 2-D and 3-D computer software programs.</p>
<p>Additionally, the contractor must supply personnel to staff a customer support window within the main campus of the NIEHS from 8:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., each operating day.</p>
<p>The above mentioned services must be performed within a 50-mile radius of the Research Triangle Park (RTP) area of North Carolina. If the contractor is currently outside the 50 mile radius, they must establish a local presence within 60 days of contract award.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">*******<span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY</span>.*********&nbsp; <br />*********This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal*********<br /><br /><br />The United States (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), Product Acquisition and Deployment Directorate (PADD) is seeking information on neutron radiation detectors for backpacks and handhelds that do not use Helium-3 (3He) technology. DNDO plays an essential role in developing and implementing a defensive strategy, with domestic and international programs, to protect the Nation from a nuclear or radiological terrorist attack. Because no single layer within the strategy is capable of providing one hundred percent effectiveness in detecting and interdicting radiological and nuclear (rad/nuc) materials of illicit use, DNDO is adopting a multi-layered strategy.</p>
<p>DNDO is the primary agency within the U.S. Government responsible for developing the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture (GNDA) and supporting the deployment of the domestic detection system to detect and report attempts to import or transport rad/nuc material intended for illicit use. Furthermore, DNDO is coordinating development, test, and evaluation programs to assess and improve the Nation's capabilities for detection, identification, and reporting of rad/nuc materials. Neutron radiation detectors used in mobile (e.g. automobile, sports utility vehicle, GM 2 ton delivery van), transportable (backpack worn by one person), and hand-held applications support the detection of nuclear weapons and Special Nuclear Material (SNM) at U.S. ports of entry, borders, transportation corridors, cities, and urban areas (Area of Operations).</p>
<p>It is the intent of this RFI to determine the feasibility of utilizing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf, or COTS, that will be released into the commercial sector in the near future, with alternative neutron radiation detectors for backpacks and handhelds to accurately and rapidly detect threat material. The threat material includes Nuclear Weapons, Improvised Nuclear Devices (IND), Special Nuclear Material (SNM), as well as the identification of non-threatening neutron emitting material such as moisture density gauges used in road construction. By detecting and interdicting threat material, illicit trafficking is stopped without impeding the flow of legitimate trade and commerce.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Department of Army Office of Small Business Programs or the U.S. Army ACC-Redstone, will take procurement action in this matter. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, applications, proposal abstracts or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information to assess capability levels of HBCU's for program participation. Furthermore, neither Department of Army Office of Small Business Program/ACC-Redstone nor the government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. <br>  <br> The Department of Defense (DoD) Mentor-Protege Program (MPP) was established in 1991 by P.L. 101-510 to provide incentives for Army contractors to assist eligible proteges in enhancing their capabilities to satisfy Army and other contract requirements, in order to increase the overall participation of eligible proteges in Army acquisitions. The Army objective is to help foster the relationship between the mentor and the protege to increase the industrial supplier base and enable the transition of eligible proteges from subcontractors to prime contractors. An additional intent is to increase subcontract opportunities under the Mentor's contracts, Department of Defense (DoD) contracts, other government agency contracts, and commercial contracts, and to promote the establishment of long-term business relationships between eligible proteges, the Mentor and other contractors.  <br>  <br> In addition, P.L. 111-84 provides for the utilization of HBCU/MIs in defense research programs.

All offered properties must be located within 1.5 miles from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center located at 1600 SW Archer Rd, Gainesville, FL, 32608. If an offered property is located more than 1.5 miles form the above-mentioned Clinic; then the base price per parking space, must include a shuttle service at no extra cost for the Government.

In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

Please send expressions of interest to Todd Pappas by mail or e-mail no later than 2:00 PM Dec 21, 2012 at the following:

"	Rentable parking spaces available and expected rental rate per parking space, fully serviced
"	Availability date.
"	Method of rentable space measurement
"	Building ownership information
"	List of services provided (lighting, maintenance, shuttle).

The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.

The Government is limited by law (40 USC 278a, as Amended 10-1-81) to pay no more than the appraised fair rental value for space.

1.0		Introduction:

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires an existing commercial off the shelf web based, Social Work Reference Center Product that will be made available throughout the VHA healthcare system
The required product(s) may also be referred to as bedside information tool because they have been designed to provide information at the patient's bedside or point of care.  They tend to provide information that will directly affect patient care.  They can be a good source for background information.  What distinguishes these products from sources such as electronic textbooks or bibliographic citations databases that may link to full text is this emphasis on point-of-care, patient-oriented information.  These products are distinctly different from text-based, point-of-care sources such as printed guidelines: these electronic resources are updated much more frequently than print resources and provide tools for easily searching and sharing information.
At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  

Contractors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the below stated requirements should submit a response of no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the above information.

A.	Company Name and Address
B.	Company DUNS #
C.	Company point of contact, telephone, and email address. 
D.	Socio-Economic Status - Indicate whether your company, subcontractors, teaming partners, joint ventures have a Federal Socio-Economic status, e.g., Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Disadvantaged Small Business, and Hub Zone.  If Service-Disabled or Veteran Owned Small Business, is your company and or partners registered in VA's VetBiz repository?
E.	If the company holds a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Contract, list the GSA Contract Number and relevant SINS.
F.	Capabilities / Qualifications: Provide a written description of the capabilities/qualifications/skills your company possesses to perform services described in this Sources Sought.
G.	Past Experience - Provide the following information on three similar projects completed within the last three years for which the responder was a prime or subcontractor.  

a.	The name, address, and value of each project
b.	The Prime Contract Type, Firm Fixed-Price, or Time and Material
c.	The name, telephone and address of the owner of each project
d.	A description of each project, including difficulties and successes
e.	Your company's role and services provided for each project.

Access should include perpetual data rights to the content that is made available to USDA during the performance period. </span></p>

One of its functions in that role is the acquisition of information in all aspects of agriculture and allied sciences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of this function, the NAL acquires journal publications in electronic format from publishers and makes the journals accessible to USDA employees and library patrons via the internet. In keeping with its charge to collect agricultural and related information, it seeks to maintain a collection of publications in various formats from a variety of publishers and sources.</span></p>

Access should include perpetual data rights to the content that is made available to USDA during the performance period. The contractor shall provide, on request by USDA, all subscribed-to purchased content in a mutually agreed-upon non-proprietary format. CSIRO Publishing is an autonomous business unit within Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, CSIRO. CSIRO Publishing operates as an independent science and technology publisher. CSIRO's internationally recognized publishing program covers a wide range of scientific disciplines, including agriculture, the plant and animal sciences, and environmental management. CSIRO's products are published in print and electronically, and their product range includes journals, books, magazines and CD-ROMs.&nbsp;</span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 102%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count: 2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">CSIRO, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, is Australia's national science agency. CSIRO is committed to Australia's National Research Priorities, which have to do with climate adaptation, energy transformation, food futures, future manufacturing, mining, human and animal health, water, and ocean resources. CSIRO Publishing operates as an independent science and technology publisher with a global reputation for quality products and services. It's internationally recognized publishing program covers a wide range of scientific disciplines, including agriculture, the plant and animal sciences, and environmental management. CSIRO publishes 36 journals, nearly all of which have content of interest to USDA researchers. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">NAL first acquired electronic access to CSIRO journals in 2007, in response to USDA researchers' demands for access to the journals via NAL's DigiTop service. Since that time, USDA researchers have demonstrated the importance of CSIRO journal content to their research by their heavy use of electronic journals. For example, during calendar year 2011, USDA researchers used CSIRO electronic journals 5,132 times. Besides its extremely important journal content, CSIRO has well developed mechanisms for delivering the content to subscribers. Its platform efficiently provides access to CSIRO journals. CSIRO's continual investment in its information infrastructure and its compliance with newly emerging industry standards makes its information delivery mechanisms extremely good, and allows CSIRO to produce desirable products and services such as its metadata service, as adjuncts to its journal publications.</span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 102%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 102%; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 102%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">CSIRO is the only vendor that can meet NAL's requirement for CSIRO journal access with perpetual rights to the content issued during the period of performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>CSIRO is the only copyright holder of its publications and thus is the only source of the perpetual data rights NAL seeks. No source other than CSIRO provides the perpetual data rights for CSIRO electronic journals and journal metadata. The CSIRO website does not provide the names of any other vendors. Having perpetual data rights granted by CSIRO will give USDA users access in perpetuity to the electronic journals for which NAL purchases access. If NAL does not request the perpetual data rights to subscribed material, its access to the material it has purchased will end when the term of the subscription ends. Maintaining electronic copies by obtaining the perpetual data rights from publishers fulfils NAL's mandate to preserve our nation's agricultural literature.&nbsp;</span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 102%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 102%; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 102%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A second reason for acquiring perpetual data rights to the subscribed content is that NAL plans to load the data locally at NAL, in order to give researchers seamless access to the content through a single search platform. NAL hopes to make this change within the life of this contract. To accomplish this goal, NAL would request the subscribed content in XML (or some similar format) from the publisher and load it on NAL's servers. This transaction would occur on an ongoing basis, as new content was published. NAL can only acquire this data directly from the publisher; there are no resellers who can provide this data.</span></p>

The purpose of this award is to provide electronic access&nbsp;via the internet for all USDA users for selected Food Science and Technology (FSTA) database by purchasing a weekly data feed of updated FSTA records.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -13.5pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The National Agricultural Library (NAL) is mandated (7 U.S.C. 3101) to serve as the primary agricultural information resource of the United States. One of its functions in that role is the acquisition of information in all aspects of agriculture and allied sciences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of this function, the NAL acquires databases in electronic format from publishers and makes the databases accessible to USDA employees and library patrons via the internet. In keeping with <br />its charge to collect agricultural and related information, it seeks to maintain a collection of publications in various formats from a variety of publishers and sources.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -13.5pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">FSTA is a specialist abstracts database that, since 1969, has been the essential source of information on food science, food technology and human nutrition for anyone working in the food sector at any stage of the food manufacturing cycle. A wide range of food-related topics are covered in FSTA, including the chemistry and biotechnology of food, dietary information, food safety, public health issues, packaging, engineering and economics. <span style="COLOR: black">FSTA contains more than 800,000 references; annual updates add approximately 18,000 references per year. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Some 4600 publications in more than 40 languages are scanned regularly, including journals, reviews, standards, legislation, patents, books, theses, and conference proceedings. Abstracts <br />with complete bibliographic details are produced from these original sources. Sources of all the materials abstracted are listed together with instructions<br />&nbsp;for full text document delivery. </span></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -13.5pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Starting in January 2011, NAL has acquired FSTA records directly from IFIS and provides <br />efficient database searching on its own platform, with other databases. To continue to make the FSTA database content available to its users, NAL must acquire the content directly from IFIS,<br />&nbsp;the database publisher, in a format that will lend itself to NAL's uses. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -13.5pt; mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">IFIS, the owner of the FSTA database, is the only vendor that can meet NAL's requirement for timely, ongoing delivery of FSTA database records in a format that will allow NAL to make the database records accessible on its own platform. Although the IFIS website lists the names of<br />&nbsp;other vendors who provide FSTA database access, these other vendors, all provide access<br />&nbsp;through their own proprietary <span style="COLOR: black">platforms</span>. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: -13.5pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Access to the FSTA database to be acquired through this proposed contract with IFIS is of vital importance to USDA researchers. USDA researchers have demonstrated the importance of the FSTA database to their research by their heavy past use of FSTA, made accessible through <br />NAL's DigiTop service. During calendar year 2011, USDA researchers used the FSTA database 25,296 times. NAL would like to continue to subscribe to the FSTA database and make it accessible on the best possible platform so that USDA food researchers will be able to continue <br />to benefit from using the valuable information in FSTA.</span></p>

MARKET SURVEY - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - The United States Government (USG) is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey.  The Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC Crane) is seeking information for market research purposes relative to X-Ray Baggage Scanner (XRBS) technologies.
 Request for information (RFI) is sought for current Commercially Available Off The Shelf (COTS) technologies or technologies that maybe currently in development that are capable of meeting a US Navy developed Performance Specification for a portable and environmentally hardened XRBS. The Performance Specification has been developed with input from end users regarding the need for a XRBS capability that can be operated and maintained in a marine environment free of shelter from inclement weather while still maintaining a small enough footprint to be easily stored on and maneuvered around the smallest of Naval vessels and spaces.  
System information will be reviewed for technical equivalence in how closely it can meet the Performance Specifications of the desired solution.
  Primary focus should be given to decreasing size and weight while still meeting the necessary environmental requirements for operation in a marine environment during potentially inclement weather. Also provide budgetary rough-order of magnitude (ROM) unit pricing. Systems will be compared against the current and future operational requirements of the Department of Defense.
Sources are requested to provide potential solutions based on the ability to meet the Performance Specification attachment. Specific information describing how the proposed solution meets the environmental requirements, such as operating temperature range, us requested.  If a potential solution meets some of the Performance Specifications but cannot meet others then please highlight what can be met and what cannot.
 For those Performance Specifications that cannot be met please detail the level and/or reason for the shortfall. The goal is to find out how close we can get to meeting the Performance Specification with a COTS solution. 
All interested parties should submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as white paper).  Offerors should submit the white papers electronically to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division,  Crane point of contact below NLT 02:00 PM EST 18 February 2013.

Synopsis:

The Puget Sound Healthcare System (VAPGHCS), American Lake Campus Tacoma, WA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis FAR 13.106-1(a)(2)(b)(2) with Building Control Systems Inc., 21218 66th Ave West, Suite E, Lynnwood, WA 98036-7302 as the only responsible source that can provide the upgrade to the existing security system in the pharmacy without voiding the existing equipment warranty. NAICS 561621, with a Size Standard of $12.5 million for reporting action purposes. There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement.

STATEMENT OF WORK

This procurement is for the following security upgrade.  The Building 4 Domiciliary on the American Lake Campus of the VAPSHCS includes mechanical door security hardware on five rooms (B-02, 106, 121, 161 and 162). The door hardware sets were recently designed and installed as part of the 'minor project 663-347 per the "Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Construction & Facilities Management Room Finishes, Door, & Hardware Schedule Program Guide" (PG-18-14). VA Directive and Handbook 0730/2 issued May 27, 2010 became the standard after design was completed on Building 4 and the specifications call out for security requirements that are more stringent than the installed mechanical security hardware. The Directive 0730/2 mandates are outlined in appendix B and address PACS with requirements that are in addition to the security door hardware (door hardware will work in unison with PACS). This project will provide the necessary supplies and service to make Building 4 compliant with this directive. Project construction expected duration is 20 days following Notice-to-Proceed.

The existing door security system at Building 4 is controlled by Andover Controls. Only     Building Control Systems, Inc. (BCS) is authorized to perform work on this security system, at the VAPSHCS. The existing door security system must communicate with the new security system to be installed on the five doors affected by Directive 0730/2. BCS connected the existing building controls to the Andover system and will have previous knowledge of the system. Also, a new Andover Controls network controller must be installed for this project.  The new network controller must interface to the existing network controller that was installed by BCS.

The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is 41 U.S.C. 253(c), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). This justification is where in accordance with FAR 6.001(a), acquisitions conducted under FAR 13 for SAP are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2, IAW the VHA SOP for Other Than Full And Open Competition dated 3-22-2011.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received
will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

FAR Clauses 52.212-4 & 52.212-5 will be incorporated into the resultant contract award.

<p>DFAS 52.223-9000, "ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PRODUCTS" (June 2012)</p>
<p>The Environmentally Preferable Products clause is included in this contract to articulate the Government's policies on Green Contracting. FAR 23.403 sets forth the Federal Government's policy to acquire items composed of the highest percentage of recycled-content practical, in a cost effective manner while still obtaining other contracting goals. Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which designates Bio-based products. EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials. Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed, but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.</p>
<p>Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) required federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products. Moreover, it required that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.</p>
<p>Executive Order 13514 (October 5, 2009), required federal agencies to analyze internal processes and revise reporting requirements in order to achieve such results as improvement of water use and efficiency, promoting pollution prevention and elimination of waste. But more particularly as related to procurement, an emphasis was placed on efforts to advance sustainable acquisitions to ensure that 95 percent of new contract actions including task and delivery orders, for products and services with the exception of acquisition of weapon systems, are energy-efficient (Energy Star or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designated), water-efficient, bio-based, environmentally preferable (e.g., Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) certified), non-ozone depleting, contain recycled content, or are non-toxic or less-toxic alternatives, where such products and services meet agency performance requirements.</p>
<p>&sect; 1. Mandatory Use of Paper and Other Products with Recycled Content.<br />(a) All paper utilized in the performance of this contract must be of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content.<br />(b) The contractor, by responding to this solicitation, affirmatively acknowledges that it will, to the maximum extent practicable, use sustainable environmental practices including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products in the performance of this contract that meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items, which are found at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm. In addition, by responding to this solicitation the contractor is certifying the deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items.</p>
<p>&sect; 2 Notice of Green Alternatives in Offerors' Product/Service.<br />(a) When offering a product or service that contains "Green" components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm, the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their quote or proposal. <br />(b) The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA Designated Products.</p>
<p><br />&sect; 2 Affirmative Duty of Contractors to Adhere to Green Contracting Policy. <br />(a) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for non-recyclable material in packaging.<br />(b) Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services.</p>

<p>RFP Expected Opening Date: December 17, 2012<br />Closing Date: January 22, 2013; 1:00 PM EST</p>
<p>Quantity: This is a Solicitation for 60,000 EA of NSN: 5310-01-353-1834. <br /><br />This procurement is coded "1-B - Competitive/Source Control Item", and solicitation is being issued on an "UNRESTRICTED" basis. This solicitation requests offers on a stock basis only, and will contain a Quantity Option for an additional 60,000 EA, to be exercised within 60 days before contract's expiration date, if demand warrants. Expected delivery is 200 days.</p>
<p>Trade Agreement Act, applies. <br />Small Business Sub-Contracting Plan may apply.</p>
<p>All offers shall be in the English language, and preferably in US Dollars. Offers must be provided in a unit price including two decimal places. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>This solicitation contains a 100% Quantity Option [additional 60,000 EA] to be exercised within sixty (60) days before contract's expiration date, if demand warrants. The offeror must provide a detailed delivery schedule (total quantity delivery, phased deliveries, etc.) for covering both the original, and optioned quantity.</p>
<p>NSN: 5310-01-353-1834 DOES NOT have Surge &amp; Sustainment requirements.</p>
<p>Lowest Price Technically Acceptable will be used as the source selection method for this acquisition. The Government will make an award as a result of this solicitation to the responsible offeror offering the lowest price and taking no exceptions to the terms and conditions of the referenced solicitation.</p>
<p>The process and controls for communication with industry shall follow the procurement integrity regulations in accordance with FAR 3.104. The Contract Specialist shall serve as the point of contact for all solicitation related inquiries from actual or prospective offers and ensure that procedures exist to safeguard source selection information and contractor bid or proposal information. The solicitation will be issued for a minimum of 30 days, and shall be advertised in FedBizOpps, along with amendments, if any. A hard copy of initial proposals shall be sent to the Business Opportunity Office. Formal discussion communication if negotiations are deemed necessary shall consist of authorized emails, facsimiles, and phone conversations. Final proposal revisions must be sent to the Business Opportunity Office.</p>
<p>The pricing analysis will be performed on a comparative basis. Proposals will be evaluated to determine compliance with the terms and conditions of the solicitation. The resultant contract will be based on the technically acceptable, lowest evaluated priced proposal.</p>
<p>Technical acceptability will be the non-price factor in the evaluation process and will be defined as an offeror that takes no exception to the terms and conditions in the solicitation. Proposals being evaluated against the technical acceptability requirement will receive a rating of acceptable/unacceptable:</p>
<p>Acceptable: Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated and rated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis using the following:</p>
<p>Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record relating to contracts of similar scope and complexity, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort based on the offeror's quality and delivery track record indicating no major issues, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below)</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record relating to contracts of similar scope and complexity, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort based on the offeror's quality and delivery track record indicating major issues. Any instances of major quality discrepancies that have not been promptly remedied will be deemed unacceptable.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. [FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)].</p>
<p>Evaluation of offers will be conducted in accordance with the evaluation procedures noted and required within, clause FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999); this clause states, "...the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered". Past Performance, including Technical Factors as indicated by the Offeror's Automated Best Value System (ABVS) Delivery Score and in combination with Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) as the primary factor used to evaluate an Offerors' overall proposal. All evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. As other evaluation factors become more equal, the evaluated cost or price become more important.</p>
<p>Past Performance evaluation will be applied to offerors, and sources of supply.</p>
<p>After proposals are determined technically acceptable, they will be evaluated based on price submission for inclusion in the competitive range. The Government may hold discussions with an offeror to rectify any deficiencies. If an offeror's initial proposal is technically deficient as to make the proposal technically unacceptable, the Government reserves the right to reject the offeror's proposal as unacceptable regardless of the cost or price offered.</p>
<p>After discussions occur to rectify deficient proposals, the competitive range will be determined. Offeror's not determined to be in the competitive range will not be considered for an award and they will be notified in writing via a Unsuccessful Offeror Letter.</p>
<p>The Source Selection Authority will determine which proposal was determined to be the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable. This factor, along with past performance, will be the basis for selecting the awardee.</p>
<p>A written notice of award, or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br /><br />The proposed contract is a Fixed Price Contract, and will contain a 100% Quantity Option [additional 60,000 EA] to be exercised within twelve (12) months from contract award date. Contract due date will be effective at the time the total quantity had been shipped, including the optioned quantity, if exercised. The anticipated award date is April 30, 2013.<br /><br />For additional information, please contact Pedro J. Morales-Rivera, (215) 737-5154, or email a request to Pedro.Rivera@dla.mil.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure.

The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF NEED<br />Hydrogen</p>
<p>1. Background</p>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Monterey, CA launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 4am and 4pm PDT. Each balloon requires approximately 80 cubic feet (CF) of hydrogen. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. Objective</p>
<p>The objective of the National Weather Service is to receive and keep on-hand an adequate supply of hydrogen to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. Scope</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying hydrogen to the National Weather Service Upper Air Balloon Launch facility located at 6100 Old Earhart Road, Oakland, CA. The total amount of hydrogen needed for this requirement is between 1,200 and 1,800 cubic feet per week, which extends to between 4,800 and 7,200 cubic feet per month (between 57,600 and 86,400 cubic feet annually).</p>
<p>4. Requirements</p>
<p>The Contractor shall make 1,800 CF of hydrogen available by 12:01 am on January 1, 2013 to the NWS Upper Air Balloon Launch facility in Oakland, CA.

After the initial supply, the National Weather Service will receive pickup/delivery of tanks in the same trip on a weekly basis on a day to be determined with the vendor upon contract award.</p>
<p>The hydrogen must be provided in individual cylinders. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store 12 cylinders of hydrogen at a time.</p>
<p>Upon delivery of the cylinders, the Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises. <br /><br />If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount, or the price of the contract may be reduced to reflect the reduced value received.</p>
<p>5. Safety and Security</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the (MIC) or (ASA), where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>

HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION REGULATION (HSAR) CLAUSE
HSAR 3052.209-70	Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates	(Jun 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

This work shall include repair of all related components and include replacement of missing or broken parts and the removal of any foreign matter or corrosion. 

  2.1  Corrosion.  USCG aircraft operate primarily around salt water, at low altitude, and are subject to corrosion.  Therefore, corrosion should be expected and should be factored in the firm-fixed repair price.  Should corrosion be found during initial inspection and functional testing, disassembly shall be made to the extent necessary to remove all corrosion or replace the part(s) affected.  Corroded parts shall be replaced, except in those cases where removal of corrosion from parts will not impair efficiency or safe operation.  Corrosion removal and treatment of affected areas shall be accomplished in accordance with the OEM manual or best commercial practices if not addressed by the OEM manual.

3.0  Serviceable and Replacement Parts.  Parts of a component found to be in a serviceable condition as a result of inspection and functional testing shall be re-used.  Missing parts or parts found to be defective shall be replaced with new parts that meet or exceed the OEM specifications.  Only new replacement parts with traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) are acceptable for this requirement.
  
4.0  Unusual Damage and Cannibalization.  The firm fixed repair price established in the Schedule of Supplies/Services does not include components that have been severely damaged due to abuse, misuse, mishandling, crash damage, cannibalization of repairable components/assemblies or acts of God.   Those components may be determined unusually damaged.

THE CONTRACTOR SHALL NOTIFY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN WRITING OF ANY DISCREPANCIES.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO HAVE DISCREPANT EQUIPMENT RETURNED AS IS, THEREFORE THE CONTRACTOR SHALL NOT START WORK ON DISCREPANT EQUIPMENT.  CORRECTION OF DISCREPANCIES AND/OR DISPOSITION INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE PROVIDED VIA MODIFICATION TO THE PURCHASE ORDER.  

8.0  Product Quality Deficiencies Report (PQDR).

SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES (SAP)
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

SOLICITATIONS MAY BE LIMITED TO ONE SOURCE ONLY IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT ONLY ONE SOURCE IS REASONABLY AVAILABLE.  THIS DETERMINATION MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH FULL JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE FROM THE CUSTOMER.  WHEN THE CUSTOMER DESCRIBES AN ITEM WITH A PURCHASE DESCRIPTION, WHICH LIMITS THE AVAILABILITY TO ONE SOURCE, THE JUSTIFICATION MUST EXPLAIN WHY THE ITEM IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL MEET THE GOVERNMENTS REQUIREMENT. STATEMENTS SUCH AS "ONLY KNOWN SOURCE" OR "ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN MEET THE REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE" ARE INADEQUATE TO SUPPORT A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE.  THE CUSTOMER SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: 
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER
	2. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
C-130 LRS-S	3. ESTIMATED AMOUNT (OVER $3,000 BUT NOT EXCEEDING $100,000)

4. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE.
Repair services for 3 ea 1500VA Inverters.  The 1500VA Inverter is the electrical power supply for the HC-130J Video and Mission Processor (VAMP) system.  It converts aircraft electrical power into clean, stable, regulated electrical power at the correct voltages and amperages to the VAMP system.    
5. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED.  
The 1500VA Inverter was solely designed and manufactured by Avionics Instruments Inc. (CAGE: 10933), specifically for use with the VAMP system on the Coast Guards HC-130J aircraft. No other item is available or approved for use on Coast Guard HC-130J aircraft as per Coast Guard Technical Order 1C-130J-4-93-70-00.   Use of another power supply/inverter in this application would compromise aircraft configuration, interoperability and safety of the air crew.  
 
6. REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES
As the sole designer and manufacture of the 1500VA Inverter, Avionics Instruments holds the exclusive, proprietary rights to the technical and design data, test equipment, hardware and software necessary to repair the 1500VA Inverter. Avionics Instruments has not release this data to any other repair facilities or entities (see Oct. 09, 2012 email attached).  
 
7. EXPLAIN WHY AN ADEQUATE PURCHASE DESCRIPTION OR OTHER INFORMATION SUITABLE TO SOLICIT BY FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE.
The data needed to repair the 1500VA Inverter is proprietary to Avionics Instruments; neither the government nor any other entity has purchased or otherwise obtained these data rights. Therefore, no one except Avionics Instruments has access to the needed technical repair data for the 1500VA Inverter. Purchase of these data rights, test equipment, hardware and software and training for the technical personnel to effect these repair is not cost effective to pursue.  
8. PROVIDE A STATEMENT OF ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS ARE REQUIRED.  IF THIS IS A FOLLOW-ON ACTION TO A PREVIOUSLY COMPETED ACTION, SO STATE.
The Coast Guard will maintain open communications with Avionics Instruments and will continually conduct market surveys to identify possible additional sources that may eventually receive OEM authorization to repair the 1500VA Inverter. However, granting access to technical packages associated with this Inverter is solely an Avionics Instruments business decision. Replacement of the 1500VA Inverter with another power supply/inverter on the HC-130J aircraft would be cost prohibitive.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.
It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  

Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  
Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 

The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

HSAR Clause 3052.209-70  Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates   (Jun 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.  In addition to DRM, PS, and OPS, OFDA has a Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement Team. <br /> <br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Within OFDA, the Humanitarian Policy and Global Engagement (HPGE) Team serves as the principle focal point for humanitarian policy development, engagement with UN agencies and other public international organizations, and other donor governments. The HPGE Team tracks trends and policy developments in the humanitarian assistance field; engages in policy discussion with other donors and multilateral agencies; recommends strategies for action; initiates policy and internal guidance for the organization; maintains global relationships with OFDA implementing partners and other donors; leads OFDA's communications work; and serves as the primary interlocutor with OFDA's other federal partners on global issues. The HPGE Team is directed by a Humanitarian Coordination Specialist, and supported by a Humanitarian Policy Advisor, an Operations Support Coordinator, and has staff focused on program development, policy and outreach, strategic communications, and interagency engagement. The HPGE Team also has Humanitarian Advisors located in Rome, Geneva, and New York. The Program Operations Specialist (POS) is part of the HPGE Team's program staff.</p>
<p>The POS's primary responsibility would be to manage administration of a portfolio of globally-funded OFDA programs, many of which are implemented by UN agencies and public international organizations. In this capacity, the POS would help manage the process of awarding large macro-grants to UN agencies, and serve as Agreement Officer's Representative (AOR) or Alternate AOR for a number of awards. In addition to managing the portfolio, the POS would also be expected to provide guidance on OFDA's relationship with public international organizations, as well as guidance on internal USAID regulations and policies impacting these relationships. The POS will be responsible to help develop and refine internal OFDA business processes and address a number of humanitarian policy issues, as assigned.</p>
<p>The POS will work closely with the HPGE Team's other POS, and would report to the Team's Senior POS.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To obtain the services of a POS to provide programmatic, liaison and grant management support to OFDA's HPGE Team.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: To access the secured documents on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, all vendors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) first and foremost. If you are not registered in CCR, you will need to register in SAM. The System for Award Management (SAM) is a Federal Government owned and operated free web site that consolidates the capabilities found in the old CCR/Federal Agency Registry (FedReg), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) websites.

Keep in mind that it takes 48-72 hours for the registration process in SAM to be complete. The SAM website is located at <a href="https://sam.gov/">https://sam.gov/</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>

All vendors are required to fill out and submit the DD2345 form. Instructions for submission of that form can be found in that link as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DLA Energy has been advised that it has been taking 2-3 months for JCP certification to be complete.&nbsp;</p>

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this solicitation will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>New equipment/parts only.  No remanufactured products. <BR> <BR>Quotes will be evaluated based on price and delivery.  Price is the most important factor. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>FAR 52.211-6 -- Brand Name or Equal is incorporated into this solicitation and any subsequent awards. To meet the Brand Name or Equal provision the Quoter must: (a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as ?brand name or equal,? the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government?s needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that ?equal? products must meet are specified in the solicitation. (b) To be considered for award, offers of ?equal? products, including ?equal? products of the brand name manufacturer, must? (1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; (2) Clearly identify the item by? (i) Brand name, if any; and (ii) Make or model number; (3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and (4) Clearly describe any modification the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modification. (c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate ?equal? products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an ?equal? product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price and total price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this quote will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>Procedures for commercial vehicle access to military installations are varied.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled LITHIUM-ION BATTERY CELLS NNC13459074Q which was posted on 12/3/12. You are notified that the following answers are made available: Questions and Answers for NNC13459074Q Question: Will a cylindrical geometry be selected? Answer: All cells that meet the electrical performance requirements will be considered for selection.	 Question: Is there a specific energy requirement? Answer: There is no cell-level specific energy requirement, however, we are seeking cells that are optimized for energy, not power. The goal for the mass of the assembled 120V modular battery demonstration unit, including electronics, is less than 98 kg. Question: Will the 16 cycles per day run continuously for 3500 cycles or will cells be allowed to have relaxation in between? Answer: The intention is not to cycle continuously for 3500 cycles. Since the eventual battery will be used for a ground demonstration, cells will have ample time to rest and equilibrate after undergoing relatively few cycles while different mission scenarios are being simulated. Question: Is this for internal testing? Answer: Yes, ground testing on the demonstration units that will be built from the cells will be performed internally at NASA and will be for demonstration purposes only. Question: I was reviewing the subject solicitation and saw that it is listed as a Total Small Business set-aside. My organization is not classified as a Small Business, and I wanted to confirm that a large business is not qualified for award of this procurement. Answer: This procurement is a small business set aside. All credible responses from small businesses must be evaluated first. If no small business bids or the bids do not meet the specifications, then the solicitation can be opened up to large businesses. In such a case, a modification to the solicitation will be posted with a new deadline to respond. Question: The solicitation is a small business set aside at this time. How would NASA Glenn potentially modify the solicitation if no credible responses were received and if it would be opened to a full solicitation? Answer: A modification just stating that it is then open to full solicitation. There are no technical requirements that will change based on the potential bidders. Question: Is there a cell energy density target? Answer: There is no cell-level energy density requirement, however, we are seeking cells that are optimized for energy, not power. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GRC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=22 Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ___ Are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ___ Are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>STATEMENT OF NEED<br />Helium<br /><br />1. BackgroundThe National Weather Service (NWS) is a 24 hour, 365 day operation, and is a public safety agency. The primary mission of the NWS is the protection of life and property. The NWS in Monterey, CA launches weather balloons routinely twice a day at 4am and 4pm PDT. Each balloon requires approximately 80 cubic feet (CF) of helium. Instrumentation is attached to each balloon which provides measurements of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and height. This data is transmitted worldwide and used to make weather forecasts out to 10 days.</p>
<p>2. Objective</p>
<p>The objective of the National Weather Service is to receive and keep on-hand an adequate supply of helium to perform the weather balloon launches on schedule.</p>
<p>3. Scope</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for supplying helium to the National Weather Service Upper Air Balloon Launch facility located at 6100 Old Earhart Road, Oakland, CA. The total amount of helium needed for this requirement is between 1,200 and 1,800 cubic feet per week, which extends to between 4,800 and 7,200 cubic feet per month (between 57,600 and 86,400 cubic feet annually).</p>
<p>4. Requirements</p>
<p>The Contractor shall make 1,800 CF of helium available by 12:01 am on January 1, 2013 to the NWS Upper Air Balloon Launch facility in Oakland, CA. The NWS will not begin accruing charges until January 1, 2013. The time and date of the initial delivery will be arranged through the NWS MIC, Admin Assistant, or OPL upon contract award. After the initial supply, the National Weather Service will receive pickup/delivery of tanks in the same trip on a weekly basis on a day to be determined with the vendor upon contract award.</p>
<p>The helium must be provided in individual cylinders. The Government has space at the delivery point to receive and store 12 cylinders of hydrogen at a time.</p>
<p>Upon delivery of the cylinders, the Contractor shall ensure the bottles are securely strapped to the stand at delivery and placed in an orderly/neat and clean fashion. The Contractor shall perform the deliveries in such a manner that there will be minimal interruption to or interference with the normal operation of Government business on the premises. <br /><br />If any of the deliveries do not conform to contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to bring the delivery into conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount, or the price of the contract may be reduced to reflect the reduced value received.</p>
<p>5. Safety and Security</p>
<p>All rules concerning safety, not smoking and the security of the property must be observed at all times.</p>
<p>Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided by the Contractor to the (MIC) or (ASA), where the information will be kept on file in accordance with applicable guidelines of the OSHA Hazard Communications Standard. Requirements pertaining to recordkeeping will be strictly followed, with copy(s) provided to MIC as necessary and upon request.</p>
<p>A key to the fenced in area will be provided to the Contractor. The Contractor is responsible for ensuring the gates are properly secured upon departure. The key will be returned to the National Weather Service upon completion of the contract.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

B.4 STATEMENT OF WORK
STATEMENT OF WORK 
DATED 17 DECEMBER 2012, VERSION NUMBER 2
A.1	BACKGROUND
Cypress Hills National Cemetery is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Shrine that honors Veterans with a final resting place and lasting memorials that commemorate their service to our Nation. The Cemetery receives visitors, holds ceremonies and conducts committal services.  Because of the Cemetery's special significance and attention it receives from the public, strict adherence to statement of work is essential.        
A.2	GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

A.2.1	Place of Performance: The Contractor shall furnish all supervision, labor, equipment, tools, materials and supplies necessary to provide tree pruning, removal and stump grinding services at the following VA National Cemetery:

CEMETERY	ADDRESS	ACREAGE	REQUIRED
SERVICES
Cypress Hills National Cemetery	625 Jamaica Ave. Brooklyn, NY 11208	18	Storm Cleanup To Include Tree Removal, Stump Grinding, Filling of Stump Cavities,   Deadwood Tree Pruning, Removal of Broken Branches & Hangers.

1.	This tree work is required due to severe damage suffered during the high winds of Hurricane Sandy. Several large trees that have fallen are lying amongst or on top of headstones and in some instances headstones have been completely pulled from the ground.  Extreme care and caution shall be exercised by the Contractor when removing these trees and the stumps so as not to damage headstones, surrounding gravesites or turf.  

2.	The Contractor shall work in conjunction with the cemetery staff when addressing any headstones that have been pulled from the ground as part of the trees root system.  At no time will headstones be removed by the Contractor. 

3.	To insure protection of headstones that are in close proximity to trees being pruned or removed, the Contractor shall use covers to place over the headstones while the work is being performed. These covers will be provided by the Contractor.

4.	The Cypress Hills National Cemetery falls within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA's) quarantine zone for trees that may be infested with Asian Long Horned Beetle. Because of this all USDA rules and restrictions regarding the removal, chipping and transportation of hardwood trees from the quarantine zone must be strictly followed by the Contractor.    All commercial Contractors working within New York ALB regulated areas need a compliance agreement which is issued by the New York ALB Cooperative Eradication Program.  Any Contractor that has questions about obtaining or securing this compliance agreement can contact the ALB program at 1-631-288-1751.

5.	Please note line 54 of the tree list that is included in this document. This includes a grouping of several trees in sections 15 & 16 on the hill behind the Rostrum that need to be pruned. These have not been noted individually on the list due to the fact that there are no headstones in this location to use as a correspondence for the tree's location.    

A.2.2	Tree Removal Inventory: The following  trees / stumps shall be removed and or pruned (includes thorough removal of all deadwood, broken or hanging branches, flush cutting of ripped or torn branches) in accordance with all terms, conditions, specifications and requirements provided herein:

A.3	SPECIFICATIONS 

A.3.1	Tree Removal / Stump Grinding / Deadwood Tree Pruning

(a)	Removal and pruning of all trees shall be accomplished under the direction and guidance of an ISA Certified Arborist provided by the Contractor. All trees that are scheduled to be removed shall be topped prior to falling and all limbs over 3 " in diameter must be lowered to the ground by ropes. At no time should any branches, tree limbs or sections of the trunk be dropped to the ground or on any headstones. The Contractor shall be responsible for any damage to the turf, roads or headstones caused by dropping parts of the tree.
(b)	Deadwood pruning includes the removal of any broken, hanging, dead or otherwise potentially dangerous limbs or branches from the tree and the removal of any deadwood ranging in size from two to four inches and up in diameter. The Contractor shall be sure to thoroughly remove all visible deadwood from the tree.
(c)	All stumps shall be ground to a minimum of 6" below soil level, or to the lateral roots, if reached before the specific depth.  The Contractor shall never grind the stumps to the depth that would interfere with the roots of any adjacent tree(s) that the Government intends to retain.  All grindings should then be removed from the cavity of the stump. Stump cavities shall be filled with clean suitable soil, mechanically topsoil, compacted and evenly graded. After grading has been completed the top soiled area 2-4 inches in depth will have grass seed (60% Perennial Ryegrass & 40% Kentucky Blue Grass) evenly applied and graded.  All stumps shall be marked by the Contractor with a red cone or flag after the tree removal if they will not be ground out immediately after the removal so to avoid any tripping hazards for cemetery visitors.
(d)	All wood chip particles and debris from the tree removal / pruning shall be cleaned up thoroughly and removed from the cemetery daily. The Contractor shall take every precaution to prevent any falling branches or trees from damaging any headstones, roadways, adjacent plant material or structures.
(e)	The Contractor shall be responsible for repair and or replacement to any damaged turf, headstones or other property. All work will be completed within ninety (90) days of commencement of work.

A.3.2	Utility Lines Compliance: Where pruning / stump grinding / tree removal conflicts with existing utility service lines (above or below ground), cemetery personnel and the appropriate utility company shall be notified by the Contractor. The Contractor shall obtain all necessary permits and cooperate with the utility company to avoid any damage or liability.

A.3.3	Debris & Waste Removal:  Removal of debris and waste away from the cemetery grounds shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. At the end of each day, the Contractor shall remove all pruning / trimming cuts, tree limbs, dead branches, bush / shrub / hedge clippings and other debris from the cemetery site resulting from the work. The Contractor shall ensure at all times that debris and waste generated by the Contractor is kept clear of vehicular and pedestrian traffic throughout the site. NOTE: The Government will not provide receptacle(s) for disposal of debris related to this contract.

A.3.4	Communication & Coordination of Work with Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR): The Contractor shall participate in regular meetings with Government personnel and other Contractors at the cemetery to coordinate contract work schedules and contract related issues. Communication with the COTR is strongly encouraged. Burial activities at NCA shall take precedence over contract work activities. Work activity and noise cannot disturb Burial or Visitor Services. Trucks and workers are prohibited from passing through the service area during this period.

A.3.5	Cemetery Activities: To cause the least possible interference with cemetery activities, contract personnel shall stop (cease) all work in areas where burials are taking place or where a gravesite is being visited. As a general "rule-of-thumb", work should not take place within 1,000 feet of an ongoing committal service or ceremony. The Site Manager shall re-direct work throughout the rest of the Cemetery so that productive use of labor and equipment is assured, and downtime is avoided. If the Contractor fails to re-direct employees away from an event in a timely manner, the COTR may then do so.

<DESC>Please be advised.  The announcement has been revised to edit the material in Section 5, Capability Statement, and to change the due date and cut off date for quesitons.  Please make a note of these changes.

This market survey is being reissued because of a change in the size standard for the applicable NAICS code.   For code 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, the small business size limit is now $14 million dollars of average annual revenue.  

From time to time, the Office of Airport Planning and Programming requires consultant or contract services to perform functions that are beyond the resources or capacity of in house FAA personnel.  The Office of Airport Planning and Programming establishes policies, standards and guidance in support of airport planning and environmental processing, and administers the FAA's financial assistance programsthe Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) programs.  There is a high degree of overlap and interrelationship among these three areas, as well as interaction with other parts of the Office of Airports and other parts of the FAA. 

Therefore, the FAA is considering procuring an indefinite-quantity, indefinite delivery consultant contract to support these requirements if and when they arise.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) notice pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e). No formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other type of solicitation will be issued. Written follow-up questions may be asked of responders for clarification, but this will not indicate a selection of preference. This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland is seeking qualified sources that can provide programmable fuze systems to determine the current technology and manufacturing readiness levels for integration into the warhead of Tomahawk Cruise Missile.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL, COST AND SCHEDULE INFORMATION REQUESTED:</p>
<p>Warfighting Objective:</p>
<p>The Tomahawk Weapons System Program Office (PMA-280) is exploring the potential development of a Joint Multi-Effects Warhead System (JMEWS), which will require the integration of a programmable fuze system. The JMEWS is a tandem warhead system consisting of a pre-cursor Shaped-Charge Warhead (SCW) and a penetrating Follow-Through Warhead (FTW). The system is designed to have capabilities to update target information in flight and defeat multiple target sets including "soft" and "hard" targets.<br />Information provided via this request will be used to evaluate and assess the feasibility of a fuze system concept using the existing JMEWS and Tactical Tomahawk Block IV weapon system infrastructure (i.e., weapons control systems, mission planning systems, and launcher systems).</p>
<p>Requirements and Performance of Programmable Fuze System:</p>
<p>The programmable fuze system must be a MIL-STD-1316 compliant fuze system that is capable of initiating either one independently or both warheads at predetermined distance from target. It must include multiple time delay settings that can be set after target detection and can be reprogrammed in flight. The fuze system must be capable of detonating both warheads post-impact; a secondary objective is the capability to count voids/layers with the FTW. The ability to program in a redundant time delay from impact is required. The fuze system should include a proximity sensor, an impact sensor, a SCW fuze, a FTW fuze, and all cables and connectors to the missile guidance electronics unit. An onboard data recorder for sled testing may be required as an option. Respondents to this RFI should provide:</p>
<p>&bull; A description and assessment of the fuze system - which must include all components and cables of the fuze system that could be integrated with JMEWS and interfaced with the missile.</p>
<p>&bull; A description of the technical risk areas in the sensor system development, integration, demonstration, and manufacturing program phases.</p>
<p>&bull; An assessment of the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) of the critical technologies (in the sensor system and major subsystems components).</p>
<p>&bull; An assessment of the Integration Readiness Level (IRL) of the critical technologies (in the sensor system and major subsystems components) with the Tomahawk missile and weapons system (i.e., control system and mission planning).</p>
<p>&bull; An assessment of the Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) of the fuze system.</p>
<p>&bull; A detailed description of the range resolution of the proximity sensor, including any environmental and surface affects, e.g. rain, sand, soil, grass, etc.</p>
<p>&bull; A description of the sensor technology capability to operate in a high threat environment consisting of electronic countermeasures and electronic support measures.</p>
<p>&bull; A description of the applicable component and sub-system testing relevant to the proposing fuze system.</p>
<p><br />Technical Requirements and Constraints:</p>
<p>The fuze system is expected to be integrated within the existing space available in the JMEWS with the following requirements and constraints:</p>
<p>&bull; The system must be capable of operating on existing missile power when in flight and communicating with the missile computer to accept target programming and report status.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must also be capable of being self-powered, armed, and triggered for all static and sled testing. A device, external to the fuzes, may be used to provide simulated missile power and simulated arming stimuli for these tests.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must fit into the existing fuze wells and airframe.</p>
<p>&bull; The system will need to provide data indicating the performance of the fuze system during track testing.</p>
<p>&bull; The SCW fuze must be able to communicate through a fuel tank. This fuze must accept a trigger input from a proximity sensor, a fire command from the missile computer, or trigger on delay after impact with a "soft" target. A redundant delay time after impact will be required. This fuze must report out its arm status. This fuze must be capable of initiating an existing PBXN-5 booster. <br /><br />&bull; The FTW fuze must accept trigger inputs from the proximity sensor, a fire command from the missile computer, or trigger on delay after impact with "hard" targets. A redundant time delay after impact will be required. As an objective this fuze will be capable of counting layers or voids and initiating in a predetermined void. This fuze must be capable of initiating an existing PBXN-5 booster.</p>
<p>&bull; The proximity sensor should, at a minimum, provide a trigger stimulus at the optimum stand-off distance for the SCW. As an objective, the sensor would provide a programmable stand-off distance.</p>
<p>&bull; Respondents to this RFI should provide:</p>
<p>&bull; A dimensioned drawing, schematic or other illustration of the fuze system.</p>
<p>&bull; An estimate of the overall volume displaced.</p>
<p>&bull; A description of any changes necessary to the nose structure of the missile and the vehicle's center of gravity (CG) characteristics.</p>
<p><br />Environmental Conditions:</p>
<p>Performance of a proximity fuze might be affected by environmental conditions. Existing information for a potential sensor's capability to operate reliably in these environments will aid the assessment. Respondents to this RFI should provide any applicable testing or analysis information relevant to sensor storage and operation while being subjected to the following environmental concerns:</p>
<p>&bull; Temperature extremes<br />&bull; Pressure extremes <br />&bull; Humidity<br />&bull; Rain<br />&bull; Snow<br />&bull; Sand and Dust<br />&bull; Wind<br />&bull; Salt Atmosphere<br />&bull; Salt Water Immersion<br />&bull; Acceleration <br />&bull; Transit Drop Shock<br />&bull; Transit Vibration<br />&bull; Stowage Vibration<br />&bull; Pre-launch Vibration<br />&bull; Boost and Cruise Flight Vibration<br />&bull; Pendulum Impact Shock<br />&bull; High Impact (i.e. Barge) Shock<br />&bull; Flight Acoustics<br />&bull; DC Magnetics<br />&bull; Electromagnetic Interference, Vulnerability, Compatibility (EMI/EMV/EMC)<br />&bull; Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO)<br /><br />Cost and Schedule:</p>
<p>Respondents to this RFI should provide:</p>
<p>&bull; An estimate of non-recurring engineering cost of integration and demonstration in a representative sled track environment that fully exercises the system capabilities in relevant operational environment. Provide any assumptions made regarding government furnished property, facilities or other support.</p>
<p>&bull; An estimate of the fuze system's unit cost for a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantity of 40 units, followed by a Full-Rate Production quantity varying between 200 and 400 units per year on an annual procurement basis.</p>
<p>&bull; An estimated schedule for achieving TRL Level 6 in preparation for a system Milestone B review. Describe any proof of concept and integration level testing required to achieve TRL Level 6.</p>
<p>&bull; A top level description of a program plan and schedule for achieving a mature production program of the programmable fuze system.</p>

<DESC>DHS/TSL has a continuing requirement on a limited source basis to maintain coverage under Bridge Task Order HSHQDC-12-F-00065 for two (2) months of certification readiness testing and support services for the evaluation of systems. The proposed period of performance for this action is December 16, 2012 through February 15, 2013.
<p>This proposed action will provide continued support to the DHS/Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Checked Baggage program for the testing of technologies and capabilities that will provide improved security and reduced operational cost for checked baggage screening. <br /><br />The current GSA Task Order HSHQDC-12-F-00065 was awarded to SRA in June, 2012 inclusive of Other Direct Costs (Materials) as a sole source award under DHS as an interim measure until such time as the award of a follow-on contract vehicle can be made through full and open competition procedures which are presently underway.&nbsp; The period of performance was set to expire on December 15, 2012.</p>
<p>The purpose of this action is to provide TSL with continued contract coverage while a newly competitive contract vehicle could be solicited.&nbsp;On November 23, 2012, OPO issued Request for Quotation (RFQ) HSHQDC-12-Q-00264 for research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) services that supports the TSL mission and which are presently covered under the SRA Bridge Task Order. The estimated milestone timeline for award of a new contract vehicle under the RFQ exceeds the period of performance available on the current SRA Bridge Task Order. It is critical that TSL continue to maintain contract coverage while the RFQ proposal evaluations are underway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The TSL requirement still exists for the 2 (two) months of continued critical CRT support services which will allow sufficient time for proposals to be evaluated under the new competitive solicitation.&nbsp; In accordance with the requirements of FAR 8.402(f) and competition requirements of FAR Part 6, an open market J&amp;A document will be prepared to cover the Other Direct Costs (ODC) portion of this action<br /><br /><br />The attached sole source justification documents are attached.</p>

Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice and is for market research purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION OR BID.  <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District is seeking information regarding capability and availability of potential small business contractors to perform geophysical testing.  <br>    <br>  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to determine the availability of qualified contractors to perform these services to include Certified Small Businesses, HUBZone Certified Small Business Concerns, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Women-Owned Businesses.  <br>    <br>  The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 541360. The Small Business Size Standard is $14,000,000. Offerors are requested to respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis.   <br>    <br>  Responses are requested only from: POTENTIAL SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTORS that have the knowledge, skills and capability to perform the work concerning the potential project described below.  <br>    <br>  Responses are to be sent via email to david.w.neal@usace.army.mil no later than 4:00 p.m. Central Time, 21 December 2012.  <br>    <br>  Scope of Work:  <br>    <br>  The US Army Corps of Engineers Omaha District is currently performing an erodibility study for the spillway feature of Pipestem Dam (see Figure 1). Pipestem Dam is located northwest of the city of Jamestown, North Dakota. The area currently being considered is slightly over 100 acres in size and is shown in Figure 1 by the highlighted flat area southwest of the embankment. The boundary of the geophysical investigations shall extend to a minimum of 100 feet beyond the limits of the spillway floor.   <br>    <br>  The Contractor shall perform geophysical testing in support of site characterization efforts to meet the following project objectives:  1) Define the depth to bedrock across the study area, 2) Provide gross lithologic data regarding the overburden materials, and 3) Provide detailed lithologic data of the upper 60 feet of unconsolidated materials. The depth of investigations for objectives 1 and 2 above shall be approximately 150 feet below ground surface for estimating purposes. Data density shall be sufficient to provide a 3-dimensional portrayal of the top of bedrock. These objectives may be achieved by collecting time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) data.  The total line length is 23,000 feet for estimating purposes. The Contractor may adjust this estimated footage; however, all changes must come with justification for increasing or decreasing the total footage required to meet the project objectives. The number of transects required to meet the objectives outlined above shall be proposed by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall acquire the TDEM data to map lateral and vertical variations in the ground conductivity.  Along line station spacing shall not exceed 2 meters in order to provide a continuous profile of the subsurface conductivity variability.  TDEM data should be coupled with sub-meter accuracy GPS to aid in follow-up investigations.  <br>    <br>  The geophysical system used for collecting the time-domain data must be a mobile system. In addition, since very near surface data is being collected, the geophysical receiver, when combined with the appropriate transmitter, must be capable of remote control operation, high-speed data transfer, and capable of very short turnoff times (1.5 microsecond shutoff into a 3- to 5-meter loop) in order to provide higher resolution imaging.  <br>    <br>  The Contractor shall obtain all necessary permits, licenses, and approvals from all local, state, and federal authorities as are necessary for the performance of the Contractor's services.  The Government will obtain any required access agreements with property owners, their representative, or agent, on properties not controlled by the Government.  <br>    <br>  The Contractor shall prepare all necessary planning documents to include, at a minimum, an abbreviated site-specific draft and final Work Plan and Site Safety and Health Plan.  As appropriate, the Work Plan shall include the results of any forward modeling performed to help interpret the production data or to constrain those earth models derived from the production survey data.  <br>    <br>  The Contractor shall prepare a draft and final report.  Drawings and sketches shall be prepared as required to present details and results of the investigation.  The scale and quality of the drawings shall be appropriate for the purpose intended.  <br>    <br>  Please include the following information in your response/narrative:   <br>    Company name, address, and point of contact, with (h)er/is phone number and email address  <br>    Duns number and CAGE Code for your company  <br>    Offeror's business size to include designation as Certified Small Businesses, HUBZone Certified Small Business Concerns, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses and Women Owned Small Businesses  <br>    Offeror's capability to perform, to include geographic span, logistic complexity, and project size   <br>    Details of similar projects and state whether you were the Prime or subcontractor  <br>    Project references (including owner with phone number and email address)  <br>    <br>  Comments will be shared with the Government and the project management team, but otherwise will be held in strict confidence.  <br>    <br>    <br>

<DESC>Additional Classification and NAICS Codes:  <BR>Classification Code: C -- Architect & Engineering Services<BR>NAICS Code: 541330 -- Engineering Services<BR><BR>The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) is the Department of Defense (DoD) demonstration and validation program for environmental technologies.  The ESTCP Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for innovative energy technology demonstrations that address DoD requirements as candidates for funding.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare ESTCP's intent to competitively fund demonstration projects as described in the Program Announcement on the DoD ESTCP web site.  <BR><BR>The Program Announcement which includes specific topics and complete submittal instructions are found at:<BR><BR> <BR>http://www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/ESTCP-Solicitations/Installation-Energy-Solicitation <BR><BR><BR>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  Awards will take the form of contracts.  Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  The government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan. <BR><BR>To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the Instructions on the web site, no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on Thursday, March 24, 2011.  <BR><BR>No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.  <BR><BR>Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a two-stage review process.  The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit technology demonstrations for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal.  Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by the Government, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages or does not encourage the submission of a full proposal.  Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, the Government will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal.<BR><BR>Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification.  A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award.  There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before contract award is made.  Multiple awards may be made to address a particular topic area.  It is expected that awards totaling approximately $20.0 million will result depending on availability of funds.  <BR><BR>Small Business Participation Plans (SBPP) are strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represents 5 percent of the total contract value.  SBPP should be submitted with the full proposal only.  A SBPP is in addition to a subcontracting plan and both large and small vendors need to submit a SBPP to receive maximum credit.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 and 541330 with the small business size standard of 500 employees /$4.5M respectively. In addition, contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  The HECSA Small Business Office web site at www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.  <BR><BR>The HECSA point of contact for non-technical contracting issues is Ms. Susan Hill, Susan.M.Hill@usace.army.mil or telephone at 703-428-6420 and for the subcontracting plan is Jackie Robinson-Burnette, Jackie.L.Robinson-Burnette@usace.army.mil or telephone at 202-761-8789.

As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers.

Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>
