<DESC>27 JAN 2011 Update: We've experienced some delays for a variety of reasons, but it appears the RFP package should be out for industry bidding within the next two weeks.  The RFI for this  project was posted under a seperate HERBB/FEDBIZOPS posting which is no longer active.
05 OCT 2010 UPDATE: Solicitation informational documentation added to HERBB. NOTE: RESPONSES ARE DUE BY 3:00 CENTRAL TIME, TUESDAY, 12 OCT 2010 ________________________________________________________________ Purpose This RFI supports market research by The Human Resources Systems Division of the Electronic Systems Center, to obtain industry input on the existing capability in implementing a solution utilizing a IBM FileNet P8 solution. The information will also assist in locating small business sources as well as obtaining industry feedback on the eForms draft Request for Proposal information. The goal is to clarify uncertainties and identify disconnects in the draft RFP to familiarize industry with the eForms requirement and facilitate quicker responses for the formal RFP. Summary The Enterprise Electronic Forms (eForms) effort is anticipated as a Small Business set-aside acquisition. However, small businesses will also be permitted to team with other partners as they see ! fit to provide a competitive bid for the project. eForms seeks to provide automation of personnel-related forms to minimize manually intensive processes, such as printing, hand filling and scanning Air Force forms for records storage. Solution will address "cradle-to-grave" handling of forms through Airman initiation of form, pre-population of required data fields, automated routing for appropriate approval, metrics reporting, and storage in the associated data repositories. The data from the eForms system will be available to all members of the Air Force, constrained by their specific roles via a built-in Role Based Access (RBA). Airmen and their supervisors will be able to query the status of their forms and see where they are in the process. Total Force Service Center (TFSC) help desk agents will also be able to see forms data in order to provide service to those Air Force customers needing help with their forms. The eForms solution will rely on the Military Personnel Da! ta System (MilPDS) Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) data service and Automated Records Management System (ARMS) to perform as envisioned. The appropriate documentation will be provided to the eForms vendor in the RFP to describe which data elements are needed and how to interface with the SOA service. For ARMS, the Interface Control Document (ICD)-in the Non-Functional Requirements-will be provided to show how the vendor is to configure eForms to permit a proper interface. Since there is a need to share eForms infrastructure with other applications across the AF enterprise, the interfaces will be standard and open to allow for accessibility and interoperability. The Air Force currently owns over 700,000 licenses for IBM FileNet P8 and seeks to utilize this product as the platform to implement eForms. NOTE: This is not a solicitation for proposals nor is it a request to perform work. The Government will not pay for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted in response to this notice. Responses will be used to identify potential s! ources, potential business arrangements, market conditions, and an assessment of solutions and products and their potential to satisfy the subject requirement. The Government intends to release a Request for Proposal within six (6) weeks of publication of this RFI with more specific details on the eForms requirements. Information Requested 1. Please review the attached items that are part of the draft Request for Proposal package. Please note areas of confusion or uncertainty and feel free to ask questions that might help to clarify the package. Answers will be provided to all vendors and posted on HERBB and FedBizOpps. 2. The workflow and business process documentation for the first five (5) forms will be provided in the RFP. These five forms will be representative of the difficulty of the remaining forms. Copies of the remaining forms will be provided to you, but they will not have the associated business process documentation. The Government is proposing an approach to h! ave industry bid a firm priced ordering table-which breaks down the primary cost drivers in developing an automated form. A notional sample of the table is included in the attachments. With these drivers identified, the Government feels that industry should be able to assign costs to those drivers against which the remaining forms can be ordered-once the workflows and business process documentation is provided. The defined work in first five forms should serve as the basis in creating the table, as the nature of the work for the remaining forms is similar. a. Please provide your assessment of the concept of providing a firm priced ordering table b. Please review the cost drivers identified and note, in your opinion, any missing drivers or if the ones listed are incorrect. c. Please note if the documentation provided for the first 5 forms will be sufficient for you to identify proper cost drivers and permit you to fill out the pricing table for remaining forms. 3. The timeline for availability of the SOA data services is not currently known. Th! e project responsible for exposing this information anticipates an award around the same time as eForms. The data services will be used to pre-populate forms and facilitate some aspects of automated workflow. The Government has indicated a preference to not delay the entire eForms project until those services are available. The Government would like to request a contract option available to execute when the data services are available. The SOA Guidebook-in the Non-Functional Requirements-will be provided in the RFP and will indicate how the selected eForms vendor will access the exposed SOA data. Also the fields requiring pre-population in the first five forms will be provided. The information for the remaining forms will be provided when it is available. a. Please indicate your ability to provide a firm priced option to implement connection to the SOA data services. b. With the timeline uncertainty, can you provide options to be started within 4 months, 8 months, and 12 mo! nths of contract award? 4. eForms will require a Role Based Access mechanism for users accessing the system. Please indicate your experience configuring the FileNet P8 RBA capability. 5. Please indicate if you have experience implementing solutions at the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). 6. Our office previously released an RFI on 25 Aug 10. Overall response was not as high as anticipated. Some businesses indicated they did not respond because they assumed large businesses would compete for the award. As previously stated, eForms is anticipated as a small business set-aside opportunity. The questions from the previous RFI are listed below. Those companies who already responded do not need to re-answer the questions below. 1. Please identify your experience in the following areas a. IBM FileNet P8 implementations to include design/development and automation of forms/business process workflow b. Implementing FileNet P8 with either US Government, Department of Defense, or Air Force organizations on a Government owned/operated network in! frastructure c. Implementing large-scale enterprise solutions using FileNet P8 (Large being either over 500,000 users, over 100 forms/business processes, and over 15,000 concurrent users) 2. Please provide list of projects relevant to the experience listed above, with associated customer points of contact. Please identify if you were the prime vendor or a partner in the projects listed. Also include the extent of your work on these projects such as involvement in design, interfacing, installation, and configuration. 3. In the relevant projects listed above, please identify major risks to cost, schedule, and performance that were encountered, which phase of the project they were encountered, and how they were mitigated. Based on the information provided by eForms, what would you see as potential risk areas to the eForms project? 4. Please identify your current Software Development CMMI appraised level (if applicable). 5. Please identify if you are a large or small business. ! If a small business, please specify which category (i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, SDB, etc.). 6. If a large business, what capabilities have been or are good candidates for small business subcontracting? Please provide supporting rationale. 7. At least five (5) processes/forms-of varying complexity-will be provided in the RFP. However, the majority of eForms business processes will not be fully identified at RFP release. These forms will be identified by name and a copy will be provided, however, the mapping of the business process will be done by the government and provided prior to your implementation. a. Are you able to provide a firm fixed price for automating the remaining processes that are to be documented? b. What do you view as the cost drivers in pricing the work with the complete documentation? Is it all based on form/workflow complexity? c. What information would be sufficient for you to confidently price the forms/workflows that do not yet have the business process fully documented? d. What approach is typically done/used to provide fixed p! ricing with work not fully defined at time of proposal (i.e. categorize Hard/Med/Easy, etc.)? 8. Will you be able to provide training that is sufficient for the government to assume sustainment of the application-to include introducing new forms and workflow, as well as changes to existing ones? Have you done this type of transition in your previous efforts? 9. Discuss your involvement in any on-going related Government or DoD efforts and how the Air Force could potentially leverage these efforts to reduce total program costs. How to Submit a Response . Include information regarding the following: . Company name and address . Technical and Program Management POCs . Telephone numbers, fax number, and email addresses . Submit one paper or one electronic response to this Request for Information.

<CONTACT>Scott Maitland Scott.Maitland@Hanscom.AF.Mil

<a href="mailto:Scott.Maitland@Hanscom.AF.Mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>This is not a solicitation.  This synopsis is being issued to identify a potential alternative source for the Air Force Family of Advanced Beyond-Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) Program.  The FAB-T program provides Beyond-Line-of-Sight (BLOS) satellite communications (SATCOM) terminals with an open architecture to satisfy the requirements identified in the FAB-T Capability Requirements summary.  The FAB-T Program will deliver ground and aircraft qualified terminals with the capability to move large amounts of information to and from ground installations and airborne platforms.  Depending on requirements, capabilities may include transmission and reception of voice, data, imagery, and video as well as broadcast reception over protected SATCOM systems.
FAB-T terminals will provide strategic, Anti-Jam (AJ), Low Probability of Interception (LPI), Low Probability of Detection (LPD), and nuclear survivable communications for Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF), Advanced Wideband Terminal (AWT) connectivity for the B-2, B-52, and RC-135 Force Element (FE) aircraft and upgrade the existing ground-fixed, ground-transportable, and airborne (E-4 and E-6) Command Post Terminals (CPTs) over the new AEHF, Enhanced Polar System, and  Milstar payloads.
The United States Air Force, Electronic Systems Center (ESC), ESC/HNSK, is seeking responses from potential sources who can serve as a prime contractor.  The Government is considering the release of a request for proposal for a fixed price or fixed price/incentive fee contract in the $200-$300M range which will develop and flight test a fully qualified terminal to meet the war-fighter's requirement for operational FAB-T terminals.  The Government's desire is to develop and ultimately deliver production terminals meeting all TRD requirements for installation starting no later than 1 October 2014. The Government may request demonstrations of terminal capabilities to include XDR and Presidential National Command Voice Conferencing and demonstrate experience in developing nuclear hardened terminals as a part of the proposal.  Firms may respond to this notice who believe they have a system that meets or can be modified to meet all the FAB-T requirements in the attached FAB-T Requ! irements summary and can meet the Government's constraints.  If an RFP is released for an alternative source and a development contract is issued, the Government may have a limited competition for the production effort between the successful contractor and the current contractor.  
Responses are limited to no more than 2 double-spaced, single-sided pages, the Government only requires contact information.  Firms who respond to this notice are also requested to identify prior contracts (by contract number and issuing office) and Government points of contact (preferably the Buyer or Contracting Officer) where they have provided similar types of efforts.  Interested firms should submit their written and electronic responses and requests for the FAB-T Technical Requirements Document to the contracting officer, Mr. Scott Maitland, ESC/HNSK, 5 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2100, (781) 271-5213, Scott.Maitland@hanscom.af.mil.  Responses must be received no later than fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this announcement.
An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution.  In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract.  The ESC Ombudsman can be contacted at:  ESC Ombudsman, Building 1606, 9 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731; Telephone #:  781-377-5106; Facsimile #:  781-377-4659; E-Mail:  ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil.
This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice nor will it reimburse firms for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.  In addition, the Government will not reimburse firms for costs associated with attending Industry Day and/or one-on-one sessions.
All answers to submitted questions will be posted on HERBB.  Questions and answers of a proprietary nature will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
We remind companies interested in this effort in any prime, subcontractor, or teaming arrangement capacity of their responsibility to ensure they address and take steps to avoid and/or mitigate potential Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues.  This is especially important if a company is presently supporting the Government through an Advisory and Assistance Services contract.  Guidance is found in FAR Part 9 - Contractor Qualifications, and possibly OCI clauses in other Government contracts your company may have.  Companies should contact Scott.Maitland@hanscom.af.mil with any questions you may have on this matter.

<a href="mailto:GILHAM.MICHAEL@EPAMAIL.EPA.GOV">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334517   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the onlysolicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotation (RFQ), number RFQ-DC-11-00035, is for a Calibration System that will be used locally to calibrate gamma radiation detection instruments.  This RFQ and incorporated provisions and 
clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-49.  This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside under FAR part 19.5.  The NAICS code is 334517 with a size standard of 500 employees. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:   The horizontal rail system shall include a Cesium137 (137Cs) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable certificate calibration source, a manually controlled track and instrument table, and a manually controlled height adjustment instrument table.  The calibrator source exposure shall be manually controlled with the distance required from the source to the detector to have a mechanical display. The attenuators for the calibrator shall be manually controlled.  The required specifications are as follows:
1. The exposure rate shall be less than or equal to 3mR/hr at 30 centimeters from all surfaces when the source is in the off position and for 180 degrees opposite the beam port when the source is in the IRRADIATE position; and at one meter the exposure rate shall be in the order of 0.05 mR/hr less than 1mR/hr.
2. The attenuators shall reduce exposure by a factor of 2, 4, 10 and 100. The attenuators shall be capable of being manually used - individually or in any given combination - including the use of all the attenuators at one time.
3. When the calibration instrument is in the irradiate position the horizontal beam shall be at least 20cm across at 70cm from the source. The vertical beam shall not exceed an angle of 20 degrees, so that the beam shall not intersect the floor at a distance of 5.18 meters (17ft) from the source when the source is placed at a height of 91.44cm (3ft).
4. The source shall be 137Cs and have a NIST traceable certificate. The source shall be capable of providing an exposure rate of at least 1R/hr at 70cm for 10 years, the uncertainty in the activity of the source shall be within 5% of the activity quoted on the NIST certificate.
5. The calibration system shall include a manually operated track system with a minimum of 6.10 meters (20ft).  The track system will consist of a distance measuring device and an adjustable height rolling instrument table controlled from the rear of the Calibrator.  
6. The instrument table shall be marked at 1cm (or less) intervals with adjustable stops. The instrument table shall move along the track by a chain drive or equivalent. The movement of the instrument table along the tracks shall be operated from behind the Calibrator to be positioned and locked in any location. The table height adjustment shall be made by a rack and pinion elevating system or equivalent. A viewing device for remote observation of instrument meters shall be accomplished from behind the Calibrator.
7. Low "Z" material shall be used in the development of the Gamma calibration system.The following optional items shall also be included in the quote, if available:a. Remote Video display of meter faceb. Electronic distance measurement with digital display 
DELIVERY LOCATION:  The system shall be delivered, FOB destination, to the EPA Radiation and Indoor Environments National Laboratory 4220 S Maryland Parkway, Building C, Las Vegas, Nevada  89119.
EVALUATION FACTORS:  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order to the responsible small business whose offer, conforming to the RFQ provisions, will provide the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Non-price evaluation factors are length of time for delivery, and past performance.  Price and non-price factors are of equal importance; however, as non-price factors become more equal, price becomes more important.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  52.212-1, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.219-6, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.222-50, 52.225-13, and 52.232-33.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii), with Horiba Instruments for the purchase of upgrades to existing Horiba-supplied engine emission test equipment/software and associated components to meet requirements mandated in 40 CFR Part 1065.  The US EPA requires a system upgrade to proprietary Horiba ?STARS? software which controls engine emissions tests.  Software and equipment upgrades will impact existing subsystem equipment purchased competitively in 2003 and 2004 which provide automated functionality for most of the common operator usages.  Each subsystem (dyno control, CVS, analyzers, PM sampler) is running software to carry out its specific functions.  Additionally, each subsystem can receive commands from the test cell host system (?STARS?) in order to carry out these functions as well as report data and results back to the host.  All of this automated functionality is run by software which is proprietary to Horiba.  The changes required by 40 CFR 1065 will require changing this software.    However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA?s requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 334516.  Please submit your request in writing to Annette Niedermier by e-mail to niedermier.annette@epa.gov.  No telephone requests or request by fax will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This synopsis is for the Veterans Relationship Management (VRM) Program Information Technology solutions and Supports Services (ITSS).  The VRM program is designed to satisfy several key challenges that veterans service members, and their dependents experience when seeking information and services from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The VRM Program will provide the capabilities required to achieve on-demand access to comprehensive VA services and benefits in a consistent, user-centric manner to enhance veterans, their families, and their agents' self-service experience through a multi-channel customer relationship management approach.  The goal of the VRM Program is to improve the speed, accuracy, and efficiency in which information is exchanged between veterans and VA, regardless of the communications method (phone, web, email, and social media).  The VRM Program focus will include modernization of voice telephony, unification of public contact representative desktops, development of cross-VA knowledge based system, veteran identity and access management (IAM), implementation of customer relationship management systems (CRM), and integrating self-service capabilities with multiple communication channels to empower Veterans.
The VRM Program involves seven work streams:  Voice Access Modernization (VAM), IAM, CRM, Unified Desktop (UD), Web/Self Service, Knowledge Management (KM), and Member and Integration Services.  The primary focus of the acquisition strategy is to reduce risk and increase the chances of success for the work streams via a phased implementation approach using agile development.  Although the work streams all have interdependencies and will be integrated and aligned with overall program objectives, the acquisitions for each work stream will be separate activities.  This allows each work stream to pursue the acquisition approach that is most suitable for that particular work stream's implementation and minimizes the deployment risks to end-users by not implementing with a "big bang" approach.  This approach also separates the program into more manageable pieces from a technical and contractual perspective.
To support this, multiple award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts will be put in place to obtain the technical solution for all work streams at all phases of the program lifecycle.  The intent of the VRM IDIQ is to provide a flexible contracting mechanism to the work streams; therefore, the IDIQ will support all task order types (cost reimbursable, fixed price, and time and materials).  A total of five (5) multiple award IDIQ contracts are anticipated to result from this acquisition, including a reserve for one (1) Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Business (SDVOSB) and two (2) Small Businesses (SB's).
The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541511.  The solicitation number assigned to this effort is VA118-10-RP-0122 and will be issued on or about 18 February 2011.  The draft performance work statement (PWS) is attached to this synopsis.  And draft instructions to offerors will be posted shortly.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  The Point of Contact is Kelly Driscoll, Department of Veterans Affairs Technology Acquisition Center, Phone (732) 578-5415, Email Kelly.Driscoll-Preusse@va.gov.  Alternate POC is Anne Marie Vasconcelos at (732) 578-5485, Email Anne.Vasconcelos@va.gov.

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought
Requirement:
The United States Government currently occupies warehouse storage space in a building under lease in Columbus, OH, that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 10,000 contiguous usable square feet (USF) of warehouse storage space. The lease term requirement is for 1-year firm with four 1-year options. The space must be available for occupancy by June 30, 2011. The delineated area is within the following boundaries: East of Nelson Rd, West of 1-270E, South of Agler Rd., and North of Livingston Ave. 
Other applicable requirements include:
"	Required sprinkler system
"	Warehouse docks
"	Security (i.e. lobby, loading dock access, parking, setbacks etc, where and as applicable).
"	Others.
The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC><p>This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only; it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. A contract may not be awarded as a result of this announcement. The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) is researching the market availability of firms that can potentially provide services/products that could be seamlessly incorporated into the baseline. The capability information provided in response to this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather a capabilities statement regarding the company's experience for the type of service and support as described herein. The information should describe how and why NGA would utilize your Linux solution; not only responding to the ability to meet the criteria listed, but detailed capability to ensure it is a viable solution for NGA. Do not include marketing materials or website links. Information is to be submitted by 1:00 pm CST 11 February 2011. Capability packages must not exceed 10 pages, 12 point font and must be submitted electronically.</p>
<p>The following are NGA's Linux Technical and performance requirements that must be demonstrated: <br />1. NGA requires an open source Linux operating system that is fully compatible with our existing Linux solution (Red Hat Linux) <br />2. The system must have the ability to scale deployments without increasing administrative overhead:</p>
<p>a. The system should allow for adding servers to environments without buying additional support tools necessary to provide updates/patches for servers not connected to internet.<br /><br />b. If additional software/services are required to update/patch servers not connected to the internet they must be identified to include estimated cost.</p>
<p>c. Demonstration of complete binary compatibility is required. If applicable, the vendor must identify any requirement for script or application changes to include estimated cost.<br /><br />d. The vendor must identify which specific vendor OS add-ons are incorporated into the Linux package.</p>
<p>3. The vendor must demonstrate their ability to manage the complete life cycle of a Linux infrastructure or more specifically the current NGA Linux infrastructure, to include the ability to deploy, configure, manage, update, and then re-deploy Linux systems, all from a single GUI console.</p>
<p>4. The vendor must demonstrate their ability to keep track of systems and applications from within the Network console by viewing reports that let system administrators take action before performance becomes an issue.</p>
<p>5. The system must be compatible with existing virtualization environment (VMware) - VMware is the primary virtualization solution in use at NGA today. (If additional subscription products or software are required to support VMware they must be identified). The vendor must demonstrate their capabilities to achieve compatibility with existing virtualization environment (VMware), and their experience working with VMware.</p>
<p>6. The vendor must demonstrate their ability to answer and service Support calls at locations within the CONUS with operational support 24 x 7, with a demonstrated timeline and process to incorporate any deficiencies related to maintenance or upgrades to the Linux OS or associated vendor scripts and applications. The vendor must identify any security vulnerabilities, improvement or new capability and process for delivering these findings.</p>
<p>7. The vendor must have Top Secret /SCI cleared support personnel and facility in the event NGA has to provide classified information from a machine to the vendor for analysis. This may be accomplished either by sending the data to an approved classified system or bringing a cleared contractor to an NGA facility.</p>
<p>8. The system versions must meet common criteria evaluation for EAL4 accreditation. EAL4 permits a developer to gain maximum assurance from positive security engineering based on good commercial development practices which, though rigorous, do not require substantial specialist knowledge, skills, and other resources. EAL4 is the highest level at which it is likely to be economically feasible to retrofit to an existing product line. EAL4 is therefore applicable in those circumstances where developers or users require a moderate to high level of independently assured security in conventional commodity target of evaluation (TOEs) and are prepared to incur additional security-specific engineering costs.</p>
<p>In summary, vendors are to provide detailed Capability Statements that demonstrate how they will meet the above requirements.</p>
<p>Additional information requested:</p>
<p>1) Company Name and address, point of contact name, phone number and e-mail address<br />2) Small business status information for NAICS code 511210, size standard $25 million, along with your qualification information under any other SBA program. <br />3) Experience in supporting a project entering into existing environments with a Linux solution. Please describe the magnitude of projects you've completed.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that any changes to the current operating system and baseline will require recerticification and re-accreditation. This factor maybe considered in a cost evaluation of any competition that may result from this request for information. Submit the above information via email to Donna J. Warren, Contracting Officer, at donna.j.warren@nga.mil Telephone number is 314-676-0196 and Douglas H. Verseman, douglas.h.verseman@nga.mil, 314-676-0195.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.75in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span>&bull;I.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Background:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The USAID Mission for Kosovo (USAID/Kosovo), located in Pristina, manages one of the most important and complex assistance programs in the region. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In line with USG and Kosovo priorities, USAID/Kosovo's five-year strategic plan envisages Kosovo as an effective state, with a viable economy and an inclusive democracy on the path to European integration.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The realization of this vision requires close cooperation between USAID/Kosovo, other USG entities, the international community, USAID implementing partners, and, above all, partnership with Kosovo institutions and local stakeholders. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Given the enormous and varied needs in Kosovo, USAID's programs focus on:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The private sector as the engine of growth, and on civil society as the means for enhanced government accountability. USAID assistance until recently was focused on support for the basic building blocks of an independent Kosovo. For Kosovo to move forward, it needs to establish a clear economic base for development and to consolidate democratic achievements. Consequently, USAID assistance is supporting the private sector, which is best-positioned to determine Kosovo's comparative advantages and best able to increase incomes and jobs. With basic government functions operating with a degree of effectiveness, it is important to ensure that there is a vibrant civil society that is capable of holding the government accountable and demanding rule of law. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Increased focus on assistance at the municipal level. Kosovo's central government institutions have achieved remarkable progress in a short period of time. While threats to these gains still remain, the focus now should be on building the capabilities of local government. Kosovo is implementing an ambitious decentralization program with substantial devolution of authorities and responsibilities to municipalities. Most municipalities are not prepared to deliver essential services and require strategic, cohesive assistance. It is also important to establish income and jobs base at the municipal level. These issues are even more urgent in the newly established municipalities and those with predominantly minority populations. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">At the center, focus is shifting from establishing institutions to making them functional. Central government institutions still require support to varying degrees of involvement. Over the next five years, the task will be to consolidate and build on successes at the center, and begin to scale back support to those ministries and agencies that are capable of successfully fulfilling their mandate without full-time donor assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Support for youth and education is a major new area. Youth-oriented programs play a central role in USAID's portfolio. Youth and education interventions are cross-cutting and based on a strong partnership with the GoK and other stakeholders. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The realization of this vision requires close cooperation between USAID/Kosovo, other USG entities, the international community, USAID implementing partners, and, above all, partnership with Kosovo institutions and local stakeholders. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">A key element of USAID's approach is strong synergies throughout the portfolio to maximize impact - such as the coordination between programs to improve the business environment; to institute better contract enforcement and alternative dispute resolution methods in the rule of law sector; and to offer integrated economic growth and governance support programs in municipalities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.75in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span>&bull;II.<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Basic Function of the Position:</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">S/he will have an appropriate understanding of the Kosovo's complex environment and the many groups playing a role in the assistance effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Special Advisor position requires an individual with not only sound knowledge of economic development but also one with well developed diplomatic, political and intellectual skills who is ready to hit the ground running and capable of working with a diverse group of people effectively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement for a construction project for Bulkhead Repairs, Block Island Harbor of Refuge, Rhode Island to determine interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, and Small Business concerns.  Work will begin in September 2011 and will extend over a 6 month period.  The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.<BR><BR>The work of this project consists of repairing an existing steel sheet pile bulkhead and timber wharf at the Block Island HOR (locally known as "Old Harbor"), Rhode Island.  The existing T and are both approximately 250 in lengths.  The existing steel bulkhead is to be abandoned in place and a new steel sheet pile bulkhead is to be installed behind it.  The stone revetment fronting the existing bulkhead will also be repaired, requiring new stone to supplement the material already existing in the revetment.  Also, the deck and framing of the existing timber wharf in front of the bulkhead will be removed and replaced.  Existing timber piles are in good condition and will be reused.  Due to the proximity of adjacent buildings, it is anticipated that much of the work will be performed from floating platform or jack barge.  However, land equipment will be required for excavation and movement of materials.  It should also be noted that space for staging of equipment and materials on site is extremely limited.  Transport of materials and equipment to the island via the Block Island Ferry is limited and therefore the contractor may need to make other arrangements to bring materials and equipment to the project site. <BR><BR>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) as well as demonstrating qualifications and at least 5 years of experience in performing the work requirements stated above.  Please include at least two specific examples of the firms experience with steel sheet pile bulkhead construction as well as timber wharf construction.  Proof of bonding capability is required.  Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Responses are due February 18, 2011.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  Roberta Williams.   Interested firms shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.  <BR>

<DESC>Posted Date: Jan 28, 2011<BR>Response Date: 1700 EST, Feb 14, 2011<BR>Archiving Policy:  Manual Archive<BR>Classification Code: B -- Special studies and analysis - not R&D<BR>NAICS Code: 541 -- Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services/541990 -- All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Service<BR><BR>1. Introduction/Background. The Fort Gordon Experimentation Division, Capabilities Development Integration Directorate (CDID-ED) is looking for commercial vendors to participate in an Advanced Wireless Network - Tactical (AWN-T) experimentation project. The project will leverage commercial wireless technologies to augment the Army's existing network infrastructure with a mobile situational awareness capability that can support tactical operations down to the platoon level. <BR>The AWN-T project will be executed as a series of (proof of concept) experiments, integrating Army Program of Record equipment with commercial wireless technologies to establish a tactical infrastructure that can support phase 2 objectives of the Connecting Soldiers to Digital Apps (CSDA) initiative and Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) needs.  <BR>Assessment efforts in 2010 proved that commercial wireless technologies can be integrated with the Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 1A (Inc1A) network. Further exploration is now required to identify technology options mature enough to be integrated into a secure communications network architecture that has options for spectrum agility (in the context of broadband wireless transport) and addresses the requirements for Information Assurance (IA) and operational certification to operate on the Defense Information System Network (DISN). This will be achieved through a series of garrison and field experimentation activities conducted with selected DoD organizations and commercial vendors, culminating with participation in the Joint Users Interoperability Communications Exercise (JUICE) scheduled for June 2011.

<DESC>This synopsis serves to notify the public of the following proposed contract action. Notice of intent is hereby provided to negotiate on a sole-source basis with International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation of Bethesda, Maryland, to acquire High Performance Computing (HPC) processing capability, storage, networking, software, and facility services.
<p>The Government intends to award a sole-source firm fixed price contract to acquire up to two years of services currently being leased under contract DG133W-02-CN-0013 which expires on September 30, 2011. The period of performance is October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012, plus three additional four (4) month option periods. The purpose of the bridge contract is to maintain the existing HPC services for up to two years while the Government transitions to a new longer term HPC system contract.</p>
<p>The new HPC system solicitation is currently available on www.FedBizOpps.gov as a full and open competition under reference number DG1330-11-RP-0009-FINAL.</p>
<p>The Government intends to run parallel operations of the bridge HPC system concurrently with the new HPC system to allow a smooth transition while maintaining uninterrupted services in order to meet the mission of the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service, National Center for Environmental Prediction.</p>
<p>The current IBM HPC system consists of two operational supercomputer clusters, Stratus and Cirrus, with identical configurations and a test and evaluation system, Altus. Each operational system is an IBM Power6-based system containing 156 nodes (32 processors per node), 4 GB memory/physical processor and IBM's AIX-based high performance computing parallel environment including GPFS. Each system is capable of delivering 73TF as measured by Linpack benchmark code. Each operational system employs an IBM TS3500 tape library for user data via TSM archival software and network. Each operational system supports a 320 TB disk storage subsystem providing sustained performance of not less than 9 GB/sec for write and 10 GB/s for read. The test and evaluation system is configured using components (hardware and software) identical to the operational systems and consists of a 6-node Power 6 cluster with a 6 TB disk subsystem. IBM provides 7X24X365 system administration and other system related support services via a team comprised of four system administrators servicing Gaithersburg, Maryland, one system administrator located in Fairmont, West Virginia, one system administrator/software engineer troubleshooting recalcitrant applications/application optimization and one quarter-time software engineer dealing with optimization and meteorological model design.</p>
<p>The operational systems are located in Gaithersburg, Maryland and Fairmont, West Virginia. The test and evaluation system is located in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The current IBM contract provides for a facility as part of its total solution, including all utilities, uninterruptible power supply, backup electrical generators sufficient to provide "N+1" redundancy, all associated facility infrastructure such as electrical switch gear, water-cooling and plumbing.</p>
<p>The bridge HPC system must provide a continuation of operational performance at least equivalent to Stratus and Cirrus, including support of the IBM parallel file system. It must meet the Government's strict dependability guaranteed performance of 99% operational use time, 99% on-time product generation and system switch (between Stratus and Cirrus or vice versa) of 30 minutes. The system must also provide an equivalent test and evaluation system. The HPC systems must be fully supported by system administrators and maintenance provided on a 7X24x365 basis. The HPC system must continue to support full integration with the existing R&amp;D computing and tape archival system. In addition, the HPC system must be integrated into the Government's local area network and wide area network, supported by industry standard communications hardware/software.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for proposals. A determination by the Government to sole source this requirement was based upon responses to a Request For Information posted on March 2, 2010 under reference number NCEP-OPS2010. It is the Government's belief that IBM Corporation is the only entity capable of maintaining the total HPC solution resulting in uninterruptable services during the transition period. Any potential sources with the expertise and required capabilities to deliver a total HPC solution and related engineering services may demonstrate its ability to meet the technical requirements stated above in duplicate no later than 15 calendar days from the date of the posting of this announcement. Any response must include sufficient information to allow the Government to evaluate its capability relative to the technical requirements stated herein. Submit responses to Contracting Officer, Michael Blumenfeld, at michael.blumenfeld@noaa.gov. THIS NOT A SOLICITATION.</p>

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the State of Vermont to provide continued support under the Benefits Offset Pilot Demonstration (BOPD).
The BOPD began in April 2005 with four states participating in the demonstration.  Each of the four states were to design and conduct a pilot study to test a benefit offset provision, with the goal of informing the larger, national demonstration project.  States would test an alternative method of expanding and supporting work activity in the Title II disability program.  The main interventions in this project were to provide a reduction in benefits ($1 for $2 for earnings above Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA)) after completion of the Trial Work Period and grace months, provide extensive benefits counseling, and double the extended period of eligibility from 36 to 72 months for disability insurance beneficiaries.  
The initial phase of the demonstration has since concluded.  However, the four states are continuing to provide data on beneficiary earnings so that SSA can calculate and pay benefits to these participants for the length of time promised.  A new contract is being awarded for the purpose of continuing theses services and will be for a period of 1 year with one option year.  The specific requirements encompass collecting earnings estimates and work reports as well as W-2?s and year-end reconciliations from the 97 remaining BOPD participants in the state of Vermont.  The state of Vermont will also be responsible for assisting with final work continuing disability reviews (CDRs) for the participants.  The state will provide quarterly updates on work and earnings changes for all current participants. 
This procurement is being made under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1)) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The sole source is based on the source's unique ability to provide continued services in that they have existing experience administering this unique demonstration and that they have developed the trust necessary to obtain sensitive earnings data from the beneficiaries.  This earnings data is critical since SSA relies solely on this information to administer the benefits appropriately.  
This is not a formal solicitation. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that the required capability is available from other sources and competition would be advantageous to the Government.  Specifically, potential sources must identify how they will overcome resistance from beneficiaries in providing the sensitive earnings data and work related information that is personal in nature.  If no affirmative written response is received, the procurement will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email address by February 14, 2011: brenda.monch@ssa.gov.

<p><br />The following have been modified: <br /><br />WIDE AREA WORK FLOW (WAWF) PROGRAM</p>
<p>In March 2003, the Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Supplement (DFARS) subpart 232.70 - Electronic Submission and Processing of Payment Requests was issued. In accordance with this, we are excited about the deployment of a new system, Wide Are Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA). This Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) system will benefit both you and the Air Force as we partner with each other in the implementation of this new way of conducting business. It is also important to note that in addition to this, the Department of Defense (DoD) Appropriations Act of 2001, Section 1008 - Electronic Submission and Processing of Claims for Contract Payments, requires that any claim for payment under a DoD contract shall be submitted in electronic form. The full text is found on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) web site http://www.dod.mil/dfas/legislative/ and in 10 U.S.C Chapter 131.</p>
<p>WAWF-RA is designed to automate commercial invoices and government receiving reports in a web-based, paperless environment. WAWF-RA allows vendors to create and instantaneously submit invoices and receiving reports directly to DFAS and/or government receivers from any location in the world. Once documents are submitted, vendors are afforded full viewing capability and are able to monitor document status from submission to acceptance and processing by the DFAS payment office. WAWF-RA utilizes e-mail to notify all parties involved in the payment process of the current status of each document; thus eliminating U.S. mail lag-time.</p>
<p>Since documents will now be entered and stored in a database, there is no need for multiple copies. They cannot be "lost" or "misplaced", and are viewable by all necessary parties during the entire payment process via a secure web site. Changes to rejected documents can be easily made and resubmitted on-line - - no more re-typing, resending, or re-faxing. Discounts become available on the first day of the discount period instead of being lost due to paperwork shuffling and postal delays. WAWF-RA should speed up the vendor payment process and get you your money faster.</p>
<p>McGuire AFB began using testing this new system in February 2004 and plans to fully implement it by April 2004. There are no costs involved to get you started. Registration and software are provided FREE OF CHARGE and we will be available to assist you in every step of the way. To get started, your company will need a user ID and password for accessing the WAWF-RA system. This can be obtained by visiting the WAWF-RA website at https://wawf.eb.mil/ and following the instructions under Help with registration for access to WAWF-RA. Under About WAWF - RA, you will also find links for Functional Information, Setting Up Your Machine, Accessing Web Based Training, and Frequently Asked Questions. Additionally, we have attached a Wide Area work Flow - Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions, Installation, and Registration Checklist. Should you have questions about the WAWF-RA system or the website, please don't hesitate to contact a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) customer support representative toll-free at 1-866-618-5988 or e-mail them at cscassig@ogden.disa.mil. (Please include "WAWF" in the subject line of all e-mail requests.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attachment:<br />WAWF-RA Vendor Instructions, Installation, and Registration Checklist</p>
<p><br />Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered.</p>
<p>&bull; If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />&bull; For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR).</p>
<p>&bull; All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />&bull; Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />&bull; Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC).</p>
<p>&bull; The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />&bull; To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />&bull; Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />&bull; Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />&bull; The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />&bull; Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM).</p>
<p>&bull; In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />&bull; A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />&bull; The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />&bull; The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />&bull; The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />&bull; The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address</p>
<p>&bull; All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />&bull; The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />&bull; Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />&bull; Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />&bull; Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />&bull; Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />&bull; Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />&bull; Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />&bull; Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />&bull; PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />&bull; If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />&bull; Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>
<p>8. Follow-up (if necessary).</p>
<p>&bull; If your (GAM or user) account hasn't been activated within 2 business days of self-registering contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />MEDICAL STATEMENT<br />Health Care: The medical treatment facility will provide urgent health care to contract employees (contract employee is not a Government employee but is a contractor or an employee of a contractor) for injuries occurring while on duty. Urgent health care is defined as medical care authorized to the extent necessary to save life or limb and prevent undue pain and suffering. The contract employee will be transferred to a civilian medical facility as soon as the contract employee is stabilized. The cost of such treatment will be paid for, in full, within a reasonable period of time, by the contract employee and will not be borne by the 87th Medical Treatment Facility, the United States Air Force or the Government. An AF Form 1127, Hospital Invoice/Receipt/Accounts Receivable Record, will be prepared to ensure collection and/or billing of charges. If a contract employee cannot pay for the treatment at the time of discharge, a statement of charges and a letter of indebtedness will be completed and billed to the contract employee for medical services rendered. An accounts receivable record will be established for each contract employee who receives medical care and is unable to pay at the time of discharge. Follow-up on accounts receivable will be completed in accordance with AFI 41-120, Medical Resource Operations. After an accounts receivable record is established and billing for outpatient medical services has occurred, the SF 558, Medical Record - Emergency Care and Treatment, will be annotated with the date of billing and the voucher number and forwarded to Outpatient Records to be filed in the medical record folder. The contract employee shall ensure that he/she provides timely notice to his/her medical insurance company and that if the insurance company is to make payment, the insurance company has adequate information and documentation to make payment. A contract employee treated in a natural disaster is not charged for outpatient care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />ANTI-TERRORISM<br />Antiterrorism:<br />As a prelude and during performance of any contract on Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB MDL), it is critical that the contractor be supportive of all DoD requirements to protect personnel, their families, installations, facilities, information, and other resources from terrorist acts.<br />All contractors and sub-contractors are responsible for providing their personnel information on the McGuire Antiterrorism Program. <br />During performance of work, personnel security and protection of resources is critical for the installation to maintain a safe work environment. Contractor personnel will be alert for any suspicious activity observed by their work force or any personnel working on the installation. If any situation appears to be suspicious, immediate actions must be taken to make proper notification to JB MDL Law Enforcement by calling the JB MDL Security Forces Desk at 609-562-6001. Both personnel and vehicles must be strictly controlled during performance of duty. No personnel and/or equipment will be allowed to be placed in harms way that could aid or abet anyone with bad intention to cause harm to JB MDL AFB. Any contractor doing construction work will adhere to the DoD Unified Facilities Construction Code Requirements. Contractors are encouraged to contact the JB MDL Antiterrorism Office at (609) 754-1397 or 1611 for information regarding the installation Antiterrorism Program.</p>

<p>Attachment 6 Contractor Free Zone Requirements and Procedures</p>
<p>A6.1. Free zones are temporary zones without protection level resources that are created within restricted areas when construction projects and similar activities make normal circulation controls inappropriate. <br />A6.1.1. Requests to establish free zones must be coordinated with those agencies involved in the project, including the unit commander or staff agency chief having immediate responsibility for the operational resources of the area, the 87th SFS/CC and 87th SFS/S-3ISR. <br />A6.1.2. Free zones are limited in size to the minimum necessary for the contract work to be completed. The free zone must seclude the construction area from the restricted area.<br />A6.1.3. The Integrated Defense Council (IDC) approves free zone establishment and concept of operations. Free zone approval must be in writing and is maintained by 87th SFS/S-3ISR and the organization most responsible for the project.</p>
<p>A6.2. Requests to establish free zones will be submitted by letter to the IDC voting membership after routing through the unit commander having immediate responsibility for the operational resources of the area, the restricted area OPR, and the 87th SFS/CC. <br />A6.2.1. Projects within or adjacent to flight line controlled areas must be routed through 305 OSS/OSAM and Flight Safety (87th ABW/SE) prior to submittal to the IDC. <br />A6.2.2. The 87th ABW/CV is the final approving authority.<br />A6.2.3. Written requests for free zone establishment must contain the following information:<br />A6.2.4. Estimated start and completion dates of the project.<br />A6.2.5. Physical description of the area.<br />A6.2.6. Prohibited areas.<br />A6.2.7. A map indicating the requested free zone area and access routes to or from the free zone.<br />A6.2.8. An outline of security procedures to be used to ensure restricted area integrity.</p>
<p>A6.3. If a contractor is completing the work, the installation contracting officer gives the contractor a letter signed by the installation commander or the group commander responsible for the security of the area, outlining the contractor's security responsibilities.</p>
<p>A6.4. The USAF organization or agency most directly associated with the project must watch the free zone boundary, provide escorts, and prevent unauthorized entry into the restricted area. Ensure sufficient personnel are available to provide constant surveillance for the entire free zone boundary.</p>
<p>A6.5. Entry control to restricted areas containing free zones will not be delegated to contractors.</p>
<p>A6.6. The USAF organization or agency most directly associated with the project ensures the free zone boundary is clearly marked with an elevated rope, barrier, fencing, or other suitable material, clearly delineating it from the restricted area. Normally, the provision and placement of boundary materials and markers are included in the contract as a contractor responsibility. <br />A6.6.1. Signs identifying the free zone should face away from the free zone, so that they are visible upon approaching the free zone. <br />A6.6.2. Restricted area signs will be placed every 100 feet on the inside of the free zone boundary, visible to workers inside the free zone, clearly marking the restricted area boundary where it adjoins the free zone. <br />A6.6.3. Security forces will provide technical assistance in marking and maintaining the free zone boundary. (Note: Free zones WILL NOT be granted to replace, or granted as a convenience in place of, the need for escort officials and escorts.)<br />A6.6.4. The free zone will be closed and secured at the end of working hours each day.<br />A6.6.5. BDOC will be notified by owner/user prior to opening/closing/securing the free zone.<br />A6.6.6. Security forces must conduct a sweep of the free zone area when closed for the day in areas containing PL1 and 2 resources.<br />A6.7. Free Zones for Protection Level 4 Resources (Controlled Areas). <br />A6.7.1. Free zones are established within controlled areas when construction projects and similar activities make it inappropriate/impractical to apply normal circulation controls. <br />A6.7.2. Establish a free zone corridor from some point on the controlled area boundary to the work project to aid in moving personnel and equipment.<br />A6.8. Controlled Area Free Zones. Establish free zones when construction projects or other temporary work activities make escort procedures impractical. Follow these general guidelines.<br />A6.8.1. Allow entry to the project work area at some point on the boundary of the controlled area with a free zone corridor.<br />A6.8.2. Ensure that the responsible activity maintains surveillance over the boundary of the free zone.<br />A6.8.3. Close the free zone and secure the controlled area after normal work project hours.<br />A6.8.4. If the temporary free zone inside a CA requires contractors to complete work around sensitive equipment or materials, owner/user personnel will be present any time contractors are in the area or will have the sensitive equipment or materials removed from the area.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.50 per hour or $140.00 per week or $606.67 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) APPLICABLE TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ONLY - NIGHT DIFFERENTIAL: An employee is<br />entitled to pay for all work performed between the hours of 6:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.<br />at the rate of basic pay plus a night pay differential amounting to 10 percent of<br />the rate of basic pay.</p>
<p>3) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command, Office of Command Counsel, 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401, Ft.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

At the end of that time, GSA will evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of the program.  GSA still recognizes the important role of our schedule holders who have long supported the MAS program.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a paper solicitation will not be issued.

<p>Statement of Work<br />Background: MCC is a United States government corporation providing assistance to poor countries that are committed to good governance, economic freedom and investments in people. MCC has statutory authority to award development grants (called "compacts") to eligible countries to encourage sustainable development and alleviate extreme poverty through economic growth. To date, MCC's grants have ranged from approximately $60 million to as much as $698 million.<br />In September of 2010, MCC amended its Program Procurement Guidelines (PPG) to provide that a government-owned enterprise (GOE) is not eligible to compete for MCC-funded contracts. Accordingly, a GOE (i) may not be party to any MCC-funded contract for goods, works, or services procured through an open solicitation process, limited bidding, direct contracting, or sole source selection; and (ii) may not be prequalified or shortlisted for any MCC-funded contract anticipated to be procured through these means, in each case, with certain limited exceptions described in the PPG. Under the PPG, a GOE includes entities controlled by a government as well as those owned by a government, in each case, whether directly or indirectly. A copy of the PPG is available for review on MCC's website at http://www.mcc.gov/documents/guidance/mcc-guidelines-programprocurement.pdf, along with the September 2010 amendment at http://www.mcc.gov/documents/guidance/guidance-2010001040102-ppgamendment.pdf.<br />In addition, a distinctive feature of MCC compacts is the requirement that each recipient government establish an accountable entity to manage the implementation of compact projects. As part of MCC's oversight responsibilities, MCC seeks to ensure that the staff of each accountable entity is comprised of individuals of good repute.<br />Scope: MCC seeks to acquire tools to help it perform requisite due diligence relating to its policies on GOEs and accountable entity staff, including:<br />&bull; Determining whether an entity being proposed for the award of an MCC-funded contract is a GOE; and<br />&bull; Thorough character vetting on all staff and directors of each accountable entity to ensure that individuals of good reputation are appointed.<br />Requirement: The contractor must provide on-line subscription service licenses to allow MCC staff to identify the corporate ownership structure of entities and perform background investigations on individuals in a fast and effective manner.<br />&bull; The service must include the ability to:<br />o Research entities to determine whether the entities are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by a foreign government; and<br />o Research politicians, Politically Exposed Persons (PEP), anti-money laundering (AML), Know-Your-Customer (KYC), Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD), fraud prevention, government intelligence and enforcement, and other identity authentication, background screening and risk-prevention practices.<br />&bull; The service must allow obtaining character information regarding foreign individuals on a worldwide scale.<br />&bull; The service must allow the verification of the corporate ownership of entities, including parent corporations and subsidiaries, on a worldwide scale, with the ability to accurately distinguish between entities with common company names.<br />&bull; The service must have a user-friendly interface that facilitates quick and easy searching.<br />&bull; The service must be supported by customer service representatives who can assist with performing searches, including crafting search criteria.<br />&bull; The information obtained through the service must be current, reliable, accessible via the internet, and comprehensive enough to provide MCC staff notice of alleged criminal activity, convictions, bankruptcies, regulatory violations, as well as association with criminals, terrorists, money launderers, human traffickers, and other individuals of high character risk or notoriety.<br />&bull; The service must provide for unlimited searching of relevant databases.</p>

The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only.

For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced.

 8347999 in accordance with Sensor Technology Ltd of Collingwood Ontario Canada, P/N: 532 2375 0562 500K listed on the solicitation for a minimum of 100 each, and maximum of 1,000 each.  

All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to Crane web site, FedBizOpps and NECO.

Note:  This requirement is being issued as a sole source.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate for only one part number, Sensor Technology part number 532 2375 0562 500K.

All other offerors may submit a quote that will be reviewed by the Government.  However, a determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Contractors must be properly registered in the Governments Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and in the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive the solicitation attachments.  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the internet at www.ccr.gov.  Information about the JCP is located at http://www.dlis.dla.mil.   

The solicitation attachments will be posted to FedBizOpps at the same time the solicitation is posted.  FedBizOpps may be accessed at http://www.fbo.gov.
  Interested contractors must be registered in the Governments Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and in the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to access the attachments.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-11-Q-P45X78 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 332999.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address:</p>

<p>Statement of Work<br />Background: MCC is a United States government corporation providing assistance to poor countries that are committed to good governance, economic freedom and investments in people. MCC has statutory authority to award development grants (called "compacts") to eligible countries to encourage sustainable development and alleviate extreme poverty through economic growth. To date, MCC's grants have ranged from approximately $60 million to as much as $698 million.<br />In September of 2010, MCC amended its Program Procurement Guidelines (PPG) to provide that a government-owned enterprise (GOE) is not eligible to compete for MCC-funded contracts. Accordingly, a GOE (i) may not be party to any MCC-funded contract for goods, works, or services procured through an open solicitation process, limited bidding, direct contracting, or sole source selection; and (ii) may not be prequalified or shortlisted for any MCC-funded contract anticipated to be procured through these means, in each case, with certain limited exceptions described in the PPG. Under the PPG, a GOE includes entities controlled by a government as well as those owned by a government, in each case, whether directly or indirectly. A copy of the PPG is available for review on MCC's website at http://www.mcc.gov/documents/guidance/mcc-guidelines-programprocurement.pdf, along with the September 2010 amendment at http://www.mcc.gov/documents/guidance/guidance-2010001040102-ppgamendment.pdf.<br />In addition, a distinctive feature of MCC compacts is the requirement that each recipient government establish an accountable entity to manage the implementation of compact projects. As part of MCC's oversight responsibilities, MCC seeks to ensure that the staff of each accountable entity is comprised of individuals of good repute.<br />Scope: MCC seeks to acquire tools to help it perform requisite due diligence relating to its policies on GOEs and accountable entity staff, including:<br />&bull; Determining whether an entity being proposed for the award of an MCC-funded contract is a GOE; and<br />&bull; Thorough character vetting on all staff and directors of each accountable entity to ensure that individuals of good reputation are appointed.<br />Requirement: The contractor must provide on-line subscription service licenses to allow MCC staff to identify the corporate ownership structure of entities and perform background investigations on individuals in a fast and effective manner.<br />&bull; The service must include the ability to:<br />o Research entities to determine whether the entities are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by a foreign government; and<br />o Research politicians, Politically Exposed Persons (PEP), anti-money laundering (AML), Know-Your-Customer (KYC), Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD), fraud prevention, government intelligence and enforcement, and other identity authentication, background screening and risk-prevention practices.<br />&bull; The service must allow obtaining character information regarding foreign individuals on a worldwide scale.<br />&bull; The service must allow the verification of the corporate ownership of entities, including parent corporations and subsidiaries, on a worldwide scale, with the ability to accurately distinguish between entities with common company names.<br />&bull; The service must have a user-friendly interface that facilitates quick and easy searching.<br />&bull; The service must be supported by customer service representatives who can assist with performing searches, including crafting search criteria.<br />&bull; The information obtained through the service must be current, reliable, accessible via the internet, and comprehensive enough to provide MCC staff notice of alleged criminal activity, convictions, bankruptcies, regulatory violations, as well as association with criminals, terrorists, money launderers, human traffickers, and other individuals of high character risk or notoriety.<br />&bull; The service must provide for unlimited searching of relevant databases.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in">&nbsp;The Government requires office and related space yielding a minimum of&nbsp;18,267 ANSI/BOMA office area (ABOA) square feet.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in">&nbsp;The lease term requirement is for ten (10) years. The space must be available for occupancy by 05/25/2011. The delineated area is bounded by: Lake Pontchartrain on the north; Jefferson Parish lines on the east and on the west; and the Mississippi River on the south.</p>

INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) at Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is responsible for providing comprehensive logistic support to approximately 100 foreign partners. Eligible countries own and operate over 11,000 aging aircraft of various configurations and associated support equipment of U.S. origin. This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 15.403). Contractor will be responsible for meeting requirements in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) (DOD 5105.38-M), and Air Force Manual 23-110, International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The PROS contract is a Tri-Se! rvice program designed to acquire procurement services to meet the needs of our FMS Air Force, Navy and Army partners. North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services. The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners. Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts. The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC. This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots. Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc) The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support. These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options. The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government. Capabilities Package: All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services. Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009. The PROS Program team will hold an industry day at the Hilton, Garden Inn, 3250 Pentagon Park Boulevard, Beavercreek OH 45431 on Thursday 17 Dec 2009 from 09:00 till 15:00. We will present a brief overview of the PROS III program followed by open questions. Points of Contact: The Contracting Officer for the PROS program is William T. Smith at William.smith4@wpafb.af.mil. All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted in writing to the PCO for distribution to the acquisition team. Do not provide proprietary information in your questions to the contracting officer since all questions and answers will be shared amongst all interested parties.

<DESC>The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has a requirement for the acquisition of expert public utility management support services for the Berkeley Site Office (BSO) of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science (SC), on behalf of DOE contractor-operated facilities in northern California.  Broadly stated, these services will relate to (a) utility requirements and sources, (b) acquisition of utility services, (c) management of utility assets, and (d) protection of utility rights and advancement of utility interests.  "Utility" is defined to primarily be electric power.
Collectively, the labs and DOE have formed an Electric Power Consortium (the consortium) with the primary objective of delivering reliable power to the laboratories at the lowest overall cost.  The BSO has overall responsibility for managing the consortium on behalf of DOE.  The consortium operates a power rebilling system among the Labs to allocate costs in an equitable manner.
Interested parties should have direct experience related to the all facets of utility management, including research; planning; technical, economic and market analyses; acquisition, including cost and price analyses, terms and conditions, and support for negotiation discussions; systems management, including preparation and maintenance of power requirements schedules, rebilling algorithms and procedures; and support for intervention with utility regulatory bodies and courts, including the preparation and presentation of testimony as expert witness.
This acquisition is set-aside for small business with an applicable North American Industry Classification Code (NAIC) of 541618 and a size limit standard of $7.0M.  
Questions can be submitted to the Contracting Officer by e-mail only at spencer.peterson@bso.science.doe.gov.  No  questions will be accepted after February 4 to allow time to prepare and transmit responses.  No questions will be accepted by phone or fax.

<DESC>The National Park Service ("Service") issued Prospectus CC-GRTE003-11 on February 9, 2010. On September 10, 2010 the Service issued a Modification/Amendment to the Prospectus providing another opportunity for interested parties to submit questions with a deadline of October 1, 2010. This notice serves as the Service's response to current questions received with respect to the September Modification. 1. Has the Service formally changed the Solicitation Number to CC-GRTE003-12? 
Response: No, the Prospectus is still CC-GRTE003-11, and the Service still intends to award the new Contract prior the end of the calendar year.
2. If so, is the Service's expectation that all proposal offer documents in response to the Solicitation bear the new Solicitation Number or will the original Solicitation Number be acceptable to the Service?    
Response: The reference to "CC-GRTE003-12" in the Service's response letter dated September 3, 2010 was made in error. The Service will accept proposals listing either CC-GRTE003-11 or CC-GRTE003-12.
3. Will the Service please provide-in advance of the date for submittal of offers-the complete Facilities Condition Assessment, inclusive of projected/estimated costs, which was used to develop the Schedule of Estimated Deferred Maintenance dated August 31, 2010 and released on September 30, 2010 through Errata #2?  
Response: The Service will not be providing the complete Facilities Condition Assessment.  The Service expects the concessioner to develop its own cost estimates as a demonstration of its experience in dealing with facility repair and maintenance. 
4. Will the Service please provide an up-to-date and complete Schedule of Estimated Deferred Maintenance Projects that identifies the completion date for each project as referenced in the Service's April 20, 2010 response to the applicable completion date required by the Service? 
Response: The Service will not be providing a schedule for project completion. The Service expects that the critical safety items will be cured immediately, and all remaining items will be cured within the first five years of the Contract term. It is anticipated that no additional deferred maintenance will be incurred throughout the term of the Contract. The park will prioritize the specific projects once the Contract is awarded.
5. As the Service and their consultants were fully aware of the more significant items detailed above, why did the Service not identify these items and the estimated cost to address each of these items? 
Response: The Service will not discuss the decision-making process for prospectus development.
6. The submitter provided the following list:o	Jackson Lake Barn, (Structural Integrity from the Service's 2008 Assessment  (FMSS 88917)o	Asbestos Abatement in Lodging Units (only one lodging unit is listed on the Service's Schedule)o	Guest Cabin Foundations o	Water Line Replacement in Buildingso	Sewer Lines (slip-lined) o	Asphalt (multiple areas at Signal, Leeks Marina and Lizard Creek Campground) o	Fire Protection (sprinkler systems for certain buildings, building modification to meet code requirements, and other related fire protection systems.The costs to address the seven items detailed above will be very significant.  What will be the funding source for the seven significant items detailed above: Maintenance Reserve, Concessioner Capital Expenditures, or Routine Repair & Maintenance?  
Response: The terms of the new Contract describe all funds sources necessary to meet the requirements of the Contract.
7. Has the Service taken the costs of these items into account in establishing the minimum franchise fee for the new contract and in considering the overall projected return to the concessioner under the new contract? 
Response: Yes, all expected concessioner expenditures under this Contract were taken into account when developing the franchise fee, and the projected return to the concessioner.

Question:	Regarding Evaluation Factor #7 the text says close proximity IN the Area of Responsibility and does not list Connecticut in the AOR.  Will a Connecticut firm (licensed in ME, VT, NH, MA, RI & CT) be eligible and considered of equal proximity as a New York firm? 

Answer:	A firm will not be rated ineligible solely based upon the proximity of the firm in relation to the Area of Responsibility.
  

Question:	I am the principal of a small architecture firm doing commercial, residential and institutional work.  At present, I am a sole practitioner.  Would my firm be considered an appropriate candidate for the term agreement described in the solicitation?

Answer:	The decision to submit a proposal is at the sole discretion of each firm.  Please review prior Questions and Answers posted for information relative to the Limitations on Subcontracting clause.

The duration of the project is 120 calendar days.<br /><br />Under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines 52.219-14, the concern will perform at least 15% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.<br /><br /><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br /><br />This project is to repair of levee distress caused by a high water event in December of 2005 and early January of 2006 in the Yolo Bypass left levee bank. The reconstruction will extend from Station 133+00 to Station 155+00. The intent of the embankment excavation is to remove the high plasticity clay that is prone to desiccation cracking and replacement of the existing drainage system with a horizontal blanket, chimney drain, and drain pipe at the levee toe to establish positive site drainage to a RD900 pump station. This improvement is intended to address the primary failure mechanisms by reducing the amount of desiccation cracking and saturation of the landside levee slope. The addition of the drain pipe and surrounding drain rock fill at the levee toe is intended to reduce the uplift gradient to acceptable levels. Because, the recommended embankment excavation will extend into the levee crest the crest roadway shall not be used during construction.<br /><br />CAPABILITY STATEMENT<br />The following requests are designed to apprise the US Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, of any prospective construction contractors' project execution capabilities.

<AWDNBR>SSU40010M0497
<ARCHDATE>01312011
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (OVERSEAS CONTRACTING ACTIVITIES)
<p>1. I recommend that Embassy Khartoum use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of Nissan Patrol motor vehicles. The estimated cost is $445,000 USD.</p>
<p>2. Purchase of 6 Nissan Patrol wagons for Mission Sudan local guard force.</p>
<p>3. 4 wheel drive motor vehicles, approximately 200 inches in length, accommodating driver and 7 passengers, powered by diesel engines. Vehicles need to be maintained in the country of Sudan. An adequate supply of parts in addition to available maintenance staff in both the capital Khartoum and the southern city of Juba.</p>
<p>4. 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. Nissan vehicles have a reputation in Africa for reliability and, as they are ubiquitous here, it is easy to source parts and locate reliable service providers when the need arises.</p>
<p>6. Offers were solicited from 3 international vendors of the specified product. Advertisement was not made, due to CO inexperience.</p>
<p><br />7. I, Robert C Wolf Contracting Officer, determine that the acquisition price for these items is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>8. No market survey was conducted as knowledge of like vehicles was sufficient enough to determine that, based on required specification and serviceability, only one source would be satisfactory.</p>
<p>9. Post has received new Chevrolet Suburbans recently, and 1 arrived with a dashboard electrical problem. Due to the fact that there are no authorized Chevrolet services centers in Khartoum, and post had to diagnose the problem remotely with a US dealer, the vehicle remained unavailable for more than 4 months. It took that long for the diagnosis, shipping of parts, and their installation, before the vehicle became available to motor pool. On average, problems with US made vehicles take more than twice as long to resolve, due to the lack of parts and service centers in Sudan. Finally, most US vendors are reluctant or unwilling to ship parts to Sudan, because they are concerned about violating sanctions in effect on the Government of Sudan. It often takes several emails/phone calls before vendors are convinced (and not all vendors are convinced) that it is not a violation of the sanctions to supply parts to the US Embassy in Sudan. Other non-US manufacturers were not included because it is believed that they are not as serviceable in Southern Sudan, where these vehicles will be used.</p>
<p><br />10. No requests from sources expressing interest in this acquisition were received.</p>
<p>11. The Department might wish to consider centralizing all procurement of motor vehicles for overseas missions in Washington, DC, similar to the DS armored vehicle program. A dedicated, knowledgeable office would be of great assistance to a post such as Khartoum, where the DS budget is extremely large, and the requests are many. More course time for GSOs/Contracting Officers would be a step forward.</p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />Justification for OTFAOC Number: JA11-016</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Procuring Activity Competition Advocate (PACA), hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>Agency:<br />Navy ERP Program Office<br />2551 Riva Road<br />Annapolis MD, 21401</p>
<p>Contracting Activity:<br />DISA/DITCO/PL8311<br />2300 East Drive, Bldg 3600<br />Scott AFB, IL 62225-5406</p>
<p>2. Nature/Description of Action(s): <br />The Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program is an initiative to consolidate the four existing Department of the Navy (DON) ERP pilots: Supply Maintenance Aviation Reengineering Team (SMART) Naval Supply System Command (NAVSUP), SIGMA Naval Air System Command (NAVAIR), Navy Enterprise Maintenance Automated Information System (NEMAIS) Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA), and CABRILLO Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) into a single system. This will provide standardization of DON processes, integrated enterprise solution to seamlessly support end-to-end capability, to provide accurate, consistent, timely financial information from a single source, and to manage and track costs drivers as an enterprise. Systems, Applications, and Products (SAP). Public Services' Enterprise Resource Planning software suite is the core application utilized by all four pilot programs. In order to consolidate the pilot programs, Navy ERP has purchased and implemented the mySAP business suite software and "add-on" software. Currently, Navy ERP has deployed to NAVAIR, NAVSUP and SPAWAR. Release 1.1 was deployed February 2010 followed by the deployment of release 1.0 to the General Fund operations of NAVSEA. Navy ERP will deploy Release 1.1 Material Group 3 and NAVSEA Working Capital Fund in February 2011 and October 2011.</p>
<p>This procurement is for a new follow-on contract for SAP MaxSecure support services to support Navy ERPs implementation of SAP software. The contract type will be Firm-Fixed Priced (FFP) for a period of one year with three one-year options. Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funds will be used for this procurement.</p>
<p><br />The SAP MAXSecure is expected to provide the Navy ERP program with much more rapid response times to request for support to SAP. The service will provide resources whose sole focus will be to understand the Navy ERP system and react to any issues related to the software affecting the production system. This will support the mission with respect to minimizing downtime and impacts to the user base for the Navy ERP enterprise business system. Other goals include assistance in standing up a certified Navy ERP SAP competency center and recommendations for improvements within the Navy ERP SAP system with regard to system performance.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services: This justification and approval (J&amp;A) authorizes and approves the issuance of a sole source contract for SAP MaxSecure Support Services. This will need to continue as long as Navy is deploying new releases to the DON sites. At this point in time, all releases to the Navy ERP are anticipated to be completed in 2015. Support services include:</p>
<p>&bull; SAP Government Support and Services (GSS) Secure Backoffice Infrastructure and Remote Support: With standard SAP maintenance under the Software License, customer messages may be viewed and addressed by SAP Global support, without restrictions. When connection is needed to the Licensee network in cases where login is required for problem resolution, Licensee requires that login can only be performed by cleared resources over an approved communication channel that terminates in the continental US. Under this contract, SAP GSS provides this secure channel and maintains a controlled area from which the secure connection will terminate in a GSS-provided, or if agreed a Licensee-provided, personal computer ("PC"). This PC shall contain and be prepared to run the agreed upon and Licensee-provided Client VPN software, which will enable the SAP GSS secure connection to the Licensee solution infrastructure. <br />&bull; SAP GSSOn-Site Technical Quality Manager (TQM): Includes but not limited to: Fully understands the US Navy Solution, Security, business processes and landscape to be able to address top issues proactively; central point of contact from SAP support at US Navy and interfaces into the SAP Back office; Coordinates integration and testing with US Navy ERP; Ensures access to the right resources at SAP (Expertise on Demand); Escalation path into SAPA to ensure fast issue resolution; Coordinates experts from SAP during service delivery; Manages top issues to ensure resolution and if necessary appropriate escalation paths; Monitors and reports engagement to US Navy and SAP management<br />&bull; SAP GSS Safeguarding and Subject Matter Expert Services: Analyzes and evaluates, provides findings and recommendations for further knowledge transfer, mentoring and best practices</p>
<p>The estimated base price of this procurement for the base year is $1,038,931.00. Additionally, Navy ERP requires as an optional CLIN for additional support hours as a contingency to meet emergent support needs for the February 2011 deployment of release 1.1 and for the NAVSEA Working Capital Funds release in Oct 2011. The price of the optional support is projected at $258,000.00. Option Year 1 base price is $1,038,931.00 with two optional CLINs for support projected at $258,000.00. Option Year 2 base price is $1,038,931.00 with two optional CLINs for support projected at $258,000.00. Option Year 3 base price is $1,080,488.00. The total estimated life-cycle is $4,971,281.00.</p>
<p>To date, Navy ERP has awarded the following sole source contracts to SAP for new software licenses for a total cost of $22,852,537.00: N00104-02-A-ZE77 (EH0101); W81XH-06-P-0604; N00104-02-A-ZE77 (M802); N00104-02-A-ZE77 (M804); N000421-07-F-0232; N00104-02-A-ZE77 (M805), HC1028-08-C-2004, and HC1028-09-P-2046. Navy ERP currently has a current contract (HC1028-10-P-2030) for MaxSecure support in place which expires 6 Jan 2011.</p>
<p>By utilizing SAP software, Navy ERP is providing a standardization of DON processes, integrating enterprise solutions to seamlessly support end-to-end capability, providing accurate, consistent, timely financial information from a single source, and managing and tracking cost drivers as an enterprise. Navy ERP is the financial system of record for NAVAIR, NAVSUP, SPAWAR and NAVSEA. Additionally, Navy ERP will be deploying SAP Supply Chain Management Software to all four commands which directly supports the warfighter by ensuring the efficient and timely appropriation, tracking and deployment of supplies. The specialized support provided by this contracting action ensures the deployment of SAP to the commands is managed by the highest skilled technicians. Without this level of support, the scheduled deployments to the commands could potentially be delayed. Navy ERP is scheduled to deploy the Release 1.1 Material Group 3 and NAVSEA Working Capital Fund in February 2011 and October 2011. If Navy ERP does not deploy on schedule, then NAVSEA will not have a Working Capital Fund financial system of record nor will Navy ERP be able to consolidate the Wholesale and Retail supply functions to the Navy. Release 1.1 is imperative for wholesale and retail data for Navy ERP.</p>
<p>4. Identification of Statutory Authority: <br />Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1). SAP Public Services, Inc is the manufacturer of SAP software. SAP Government Support and Services Inc. is the only company that maintains the proprietary rights to the source code, distribution rights and support services. There are no other authorized resellers of MaxSecure support for SAP software.</p>
<p>5. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications: <br />SAP is the core ERP software being utilized by Navy ERP. All four Navy ERP pilot programs were deployed using SAP software. Navy ERPs mission is to converge the four pilot programs for implementation throughout the Navy. Navy ERP has purchased and implemented the SAP software suite within its architecture and within the Development, Quality Assurance (QA), Production and Disaster Recovery Centers in order to consolidate the exiting functionality. Navy ERP has deployed the SAP ERP system to NAVAIR, NAVSUP and SPAWAR. This requirement is for additional software support services to be provided by SAP personnel who have the training, knowledge and understanding of the SAP source codes and functionality required to provide this level of support. To date, Navy ERP has awarded the following sole source contracts to SAP for new software licenses for a total cost of $22,852,537.00: N00104-02-A-ZE77 (EH0101); W81XH-06-P-0604; N00104-02-A-ZE77 (M802); N00104-02-A-ZE77 (M804); N000421-07-F-0232; N00104-02-A-ZE77 (M805), and HC1028-08-C-2004.</p>
<p>Navy ERP has awarded the following maintenance support renewal contracts for a total of $5,154,833.00: N00024-05-F-B105; N00024-06-F-B033; N00104-02-A-ZE77 (M803); HC1013-07-F-3350, N00104-02-A-ZE77 (KH01) and HC1028-08-C-2004.</p>
<p>Navy ERP awarded the previous support services on contract HC1028-08-F-2122 for a cost of $1.5M, support services on contract HC1028-09-P-2046 for a cost of 1.5M, and support services on the current contract HC1028-10-P-2030, for a cost of 1.5M.</p>
<p>Navy ERP will lack the support necessary to resolve problems which may arise with the Navy ERP financial system of record, provided by SAP. It is imperative that the Navy ERP financial system is operating at full capacity at all times. Issues could lead to reduced production system health, reduced response time, lack of user access. As an ACAT I program, down time will lead to loss of functionality, which results in massive loss of funds.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT

VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS) Contracting Office, Baltimore, Maryland intends to award a sole source fixed-price service for the acquisition of a certified and trained engineer to perform scheduled Planned Maintenance (PM) and unscheduled repairs on Agency's existing trademarked Sterrad systems. 
  
The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate sole award under authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency's requirements and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals. 

 
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
PURCHASE REQUEST:  792-11-1-129-0006

1.  Contracting Activity:  VA Capitol Health Care Network (VISN 5), Contracting Division, 10 North Greene Street, Maryland 21201.

Services:  The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Maryland Health Care System (VAMHCS), VISN 5 Contracting Office proposes to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Facilities and Engineering (138), 10 North Greene Street, Baltimore, MD 21201.

2.  Description of Action:  The Justification for the use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) is contained in FAR 6.302-1. In effect, a Sole Source Firm-Fixed Price Service Contract is being requested by Facilities and Engineering (138), Sterilization Processing Decontamination (SPD). VAMHCS Contracting intends to negotiate and award a Sole source service contract to Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP), a company currently used and also servicing agent in the Baltimore VA Medical Center (VAMC) system.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services:   This requirement is for the acquisition to acquire a trained and certified engineer to perform scheduled planned maintenance (PM) and unscheduled repairs on Agencys existing trademarked STERRAD systems. It also requires the provision of personnel, management, material, parts, equipment, supplies, labor and transportation. Equipment, parts, and maintenance/technical support servicecurrently covered under company warrant, only an authorized Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) engineer can perform required preventive maintenance and repair services on the sterilization systems and equip the STERRAD Model 100 NX and STERRAD Model 100S with proprietary parts. In addition, these systems are high-demand devices used in the processing of medical instrumentation.  

The estimated value for this FY11 requirement is $30,028.04.

4.  Authority Cited:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) Competition Requirement, as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart FAR 6.302-1 entitled Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirement.  Under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible sourceand no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for. Further, FAR Subpart 6.302-1(c) prescribes acquisitions using a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited.   

5.  Reason for Authority Cited: In accordance with (IAW) companys policy and service agreement terms and conditions, only engineers trained and certified by Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) are authorized to repair and/or service ASPs trademarked STERRAD systems and provide proprietary parts available solely from the servicing company. Therefore, compliance is required: service attempted or performed by any person or company not authorized to perform such service will constitute a breach of the agreement and will consequently void the warranty on the STERRAD systems currently in operation at Baltimore VA Medical Center.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:   NA

7.  Determination of a Fair and Reasonable Cost: The Contracting Officer will determine that the anticipated cost to the Government is fair and reasonable based on a complete analysis of all costs or a price analysis will be fully utilized prior to award of the contract. 

8.  Market Research: As noted in Question 4, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) authority Sole source awards may be used when only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and will affect the VA in meeting its organizational mission in a timely manner, thereby, precluding full-and-open-competition consideration.

9.  Any Other Supporting Facts: (See Question 5) Compliance with the specifics of the warrant and the service agreement is required: service attempted or performed by any person or company not authorized to perform such service will constitute a breach of the agreement and will consequently void the warranty on the STERRAD systems currently in operation at Baltimore VA Medical Center. This single factor precludes modification to enhance competition. Thus, acquiring a service contract with a potential contractor other than the suggested source can potentially prove too costly and injurious to the Government.

10.  Listing of Sources:  The VA Service Department will develop an acquisition strategy and pre-plan for any upcoming requirements or renewals which will provide potential Contractors with opportunities and resources for supporting the VA in the future acquisitions.

11. Action to Increase Competition: (See Question 10).
