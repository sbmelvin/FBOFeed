<DESC><br/>Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS)<br/><br/>The Army Contracting Command (ACC) - Picatinny, on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, has a requirement for manufacturing the XM153, Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS), recapitalization of the previously delivered XM153 CROWS, engineering and logistics services, and spares parts. <br/><br/>The CROWS is a multivehicle externally mounted weapon mounting and control system that allows the gunner to remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing a variety of crew served weapons.  The CROWS provides remote day and night sighting and ballistic control capability, providing first-burst engagement of targets at maximum effective weapon range while on the move. The major CROWS sub-assemblies include: Fire Control Unit, Control Grip, Main Frame Assy, Right Side Support Assy, Left Side Support Assy, Servo Sight Assy, Thermal Imaging Module, Visual Imaging Module, Soft Mount, Cocking Actuator, Laser Range Finder, Ammo Box Assy, Weapon Adaption Kits, Cables, and Cover.  This list is not intended to be all inclusive.  <br/><br/>The Government has determined that a Full and Open Competition Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contract will be utilized for the CROWS requirement.  The expected contract duration is five (5) years. Orders will be issued against the IDIQ contract(s) under three (3) separate and distinct areas of its Statement of Work (SOW).  Each area will have a different contract type associated with it.  The three (3) areas of the SOW and the three (3) planned contract types associated with each one for this requirement are as follows:<br/><br/>I. Fixed-Price, IDIQ: To support production of a maximum of 18,000 CROWS, field maintenance support, and spares.  The production rate can vary, depending on requirements and funding availability from 0 to 300 CROWS per month with the ability to surge to 500 CROWS per month for limited durations, as required.<br/><br/>II. Fixed-Price Incentive, IDIQ:  To support product improvements, integrations, and testing.  Share line will be 50/50 with 120 percent ceiling as a point of departure. <br/><br/>III.

This requirement applies equally to successful offerors and any subcontractors the successful offeror may use. <br>  <br> Government may, in its sole discretion, conduct a criminal history check on each successful offeror or subcontractor employee for the purpose of screening the potential security risk each employee may present as he/she works on the installation.  The government shall determine the risk each employee presents to the installation, and may, in its sole discretion, prevent individual employees from gaining access to this installation.

If the government determines that the employee is unacceptable, the government shall provide the offeror a written notice with the name of the employee denied access.  Offeror shall be responsible for finding a suitable replacement worker who may be granted temporary permission to work under the contract until a criminal history check has been completed.  If the successful contractor is unable to replace the employees, the government reserves the right to determine the bid as non-responsive and deny award of the contract to the offeror. <br>  <br> If, after award of the contract and during the course of performance the successful offeror now as contractor finds it necessary to substitute employees under the contract, contractor shall submit the same information of those replacement employees as stated above.

Terminate the contract for the convenience of the government at no cost to the government: or <br>  <br> 2.  Termination of the contract for Cause <br>  <br> C.7.2  Successful offeror/contractor understands that the installation access control procedures may delay the time it takes to enter or exit the installation and may prevent the contractor from working totally on certain days or periods of time due to increased threat condition levels.

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code anticipated for this effort is 238160  The Small Business Administration Size Standard for NAICS Code 238160 is $14.0 million.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD), Norfolk, VA, on behalf of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), is soliciting an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type of contract for Independent External Peer Reviews. The nature of the work to be performed primarily involves independently identifying, selecting, and compensating reviewers based on their expert qualifications and rigorous peer review standards, and providing all logistical support for each review. Expertise that may be required will be for various scientific topics related to NMFS fisheries management issues, such as:
<p>&bull; Stock assessments and population dynamic modeling of living marine resources, including fish, marine mammals, or sea turtles;<br />&bull; Socioeconomic assessments and analytical methods;<br />&bull; Oceanographic, ecological, and socioeconomic factors that affect living marine resources;<br />&bull; NMFS' mission-related science and research program reviews;<br />&bull; Biological opinions, recovery plans, and status reviews for the Endangered Species Act, and other protected species; and<br />&bull; Review of sampling design and technologies, analytical methods, and strategies of scientific programs or management strategies.</p>
<p>The contractor must have knowledge of and access to a sufficiently large pool of qualified experts to accommodate 24 - 36 desk-type or panel-type reviews per year. Deliverables in the form of final peer review reports are also independently reviewed by the contractor's qualified technical team before delivery to the NMFS. The Contractor shall be able to accommodate unexpected changes in requirements and rescheduling. Requirements for independent external peer reviews often vary in the type of review, the number of external reviewers, the number of days required from each external reviewer, and the dates of the review.

<DESC>SERVICES REQUIRED: This solicitation is for a Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) for providing Primary Care and Mental Health Services in a private hospital, office or clinic environment to Veterans primarily residing in Beaver County, PA.  The Parent Facility for this CBOC is the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (VAPHS), located 37 miles from Beaver County, the place of performance.  Unless otherwise noted, hereafter within this document, singular terms such as "CBOC," "clinic," or "Contractor's facility" shall refer to the Beaver County CBOC.  The Contractor shall provide a community-based outpatient clinic solely dedicated to Veterans.  Primary Care services will provide a continuum of care from prevention to diagnosis and treatment, to appropriate referral and follow-up.  Those patients needing specialty or follow-up care shall be referred to VAPHS.  The CBOC must have the necessary professional medical staff, diagnostic testing and treatment capability, and referral arrangements needed to ensure continuity of health care.  Primary Care services include longitudinal outpatient medical care for the purposes of prevention and detection of disease and subsequent management of medical conditions, for Veterans deemed eligible.  The care will be provided by primary care providers who may be general practitioners or general internists or their authorized designees.  The proposed CBOC, at a minimum, shall provide one standard of care that must be consistent, safe and of high quality.  Additionally, the proposed CBOC is expected to comply with all relevant VA policies and procedures, including those related to quality, patient safety, and performance.  The CBOC must be poised to respond quickly to VA policy and procedure changes.  If requested or required by either the government or the Contractor, the Contractor will work closely with the Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to modify the contract expeditiously, in order to limit the impact on the clinic's Veterans and ensure consistency with the care provided by the VA's other Primary Care Clinics. 

Scheduled initial or follow-up visits to primary care providers at the CBOC site. A complete history and physical examination which includes cervical cancer screening for women (including one of the following Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes: 99203-99205; 99213-99215; 99243-99245; 99385-99387; or 99395-99397.) must be performed on the first visit other than in exceptional circumstances.  This is a Vesting CPT Code visit.  Exceptional circumstances means the Veteran is seen for his/her first visit as an emergency for a shorter duration visit.  In this case, a complete history and physical examination must be completed within the next two (2) months or before the end of the VA Fiscal Year (September 30), whichever comes first.  The complete history and physical examination will be performed with documentation of Veteran problems via the on-line Problem List option in the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA)/Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) computer system which will be updated as needed on each subsequent visit.  The Problem List is to be updated by the third visit and all subsequent visits, and include all significant diagnoses, procedures, drug allergies, and medications.  Within twelve (12) months of the last visit, the Veteran must receive a visit which justifies any of the Vesting CPT Codes.

Offers will be considered only from offerors who are regularly established in the business called for and who, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, are financially responsible and able to show evidence of their responsibility, ability, experience, equipment, facilities, and personnel directly employed or supervised by them to render prompt and satisfactory service in the volume required for all items under this contract. By the signing of this offer, offeror is certifying that he/she shall meet all requirements of Federal, State, or local laws, codes, and/or regulations and all applicable standards in the most current version of The Joint Commission Accreditation Manual for Hospitals, or equivalent accrediting body, regarding the operation of this type of service. 

Any subcontractor utilized by Contractor for the provision of services required under this contract must meet the same qualifications specified herein for Contractor, as appropriate to the work being performed.  Contractor must obtain prior approval from the Contracting Officer for subcontractor(s) utilized.  

In an effort to achieve socioeconomic small business goals, depending on the evaluation factors included in the solicitation, VA shall evaluate offerors based on their service-disabled Veteran-owned or Veteran-owned small business status and their proposed use of eligible service-disabled Veteran-owned small businesses and Veteran-owned small businesses as subcontractors.  The offeror agrees, if awarded a contract, to use the service-disabled Veteran-owned small businesses or Veteran-owned small businesses proposed as subcontractors in accordance with 852.215-70, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors, or to substitute one or more service-disabled Veteran-owned small businesses or Veteran-owned small businesses for subcontract work of the same or similar value.

Thirty (30) days prior to the contract expiration date, Contractor will certify in writing to the Contracting Officer that all licenses and registrations of personnel employed under this contract are valid and current and will be renewed as necessary during the option period.  Failure to provide this certification may result in a determination not to exercise the VA's renewal option.  Updated copies of all licenses and registrations will be provided to the Contracting Officer annually no later than the contract anniversary date.

<a href="mailto:wilton.t.sanders@nasa.gov">Dr Wilton T. Sanders</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>Proposal Due Date: 90 days after release of AO The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is releasing this Community Announcement concerning its intention to solicit investigations for the Astrophysics Explorer Program. The Astrophysics Explorer Program conducts Principal Investigator (PI)-led space science investigations to advance NASAs strategic goals in astrophysics, which are to discover the origin, structure, evolution, and destiny of the Universe and search for Earth-like planets. Additional information concerning these areas of investigation is provided through appropriate links found on the SMD homepage at http://science.nasa.gov/	  . &lt;p&gt; The current state of planning calls for NASA SMD to release an Announcement of Opportunity (AO) in the late summer/early fall of 2014 that will solicit proposals for Small Explorer (SMEX) missions to accomplish Astrophysics Explorer Program science objectives. NASA also plans to release simultaneously a solicitation for Astrophysics Explorer Missions of Opportunity (MO) through the NASA Announcement of Opportunity NNH12ZDA006O, Second Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON-2). A draft SMEX AO and draft SALMON-2 amendment are expected to be ready for release for comment in Spring 2014. &lt;p&gt; The PI-managed mission cost cap for an Astrophysics SMEX mission is expected to be no greater than $125M in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 dollars, not including the cost of any contributions or of the NASA provided launch services, either an Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) or transportation to the International Space Station (ISS). Standard launch services to the ISS or on an ELV will be provided for SMEX missions at no charge against the mission cost cap. The standard ELV launch services offered will be similar to the ELV Launch Service Class Option B described in the Explorer Program Librarys launch services document (see http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/EX     ). There will be a charge against the mission cost cap for mission unique and special launch services beyond the standard launch services offered.  The Explorer Program Librarys launch services document will be updated for the 2014 Astrophysics SMEX AO. &lt;p&gt; The PI-managed mission cost cap for an Astrophysics Explorer MO is expected to be no greater than $65M or $35M in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 dollars. NASA expects to solicit MO science investigations that are defined in the SALMON-2 AO as Partner MOs, New Missions using Existing Spacecraft MOs, or Small Complete Mission MOs, including investigations requiring flight on the International Space Station. Suborbital-class MOs have a $35M PI-managed mission cost cap; this includes missions on ultra-long duration balloons, suborbital reusable launch vehicles (RLVs), and CubeSats. Other (not suborbital-class) MOs will have a $65M PI-managed mission cost cap. &lt;p&gt; The currently approved Astrophysics Explorer Program planning budget is sufficient to select and execute one SMEX mission and one MO. &lt;p&gt; The current planning is for the selection process to be done in two stages. In Step 1, it is anticipated that two or three SMEX missions and one to three MO missions may be selected for one-year Phase A concept studies. Each SMEX concept study would be funded up to $1M in real year dollars, and each MO concept study would be funded up to $250K in real year dollars. For Step 2, NASA will conduct a detailed review of the Phase A concept study reports. As a result of this second evaluation, NASA expects to select one SMEX mission and one MO mission to proceed into Phase B and subsequent mission phases. NASA desires to launch the SMEX mission by the end of 2020. &lt;p&gt; Proposals in response to this AO will be due 90 days after its formal release. Participation will be open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S. organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, NASA Centers, and other Government agencies. &lt;p&gt; The schedule for the solicitation is intended to be:    Release of draft AO: (target) Spring 2014 (target);    Explorer workshop: ~2 weeks after draft AO release;    Release of final AO: (target) Late summer/early fall 2014 (target);    Preproposal conference: ~3 weeks after final AO release;    Proposals due: 90 days after AO release;   Selection for competitive Phase A studies: Summer 2015 (target);    Concept study reports due: Summer 2016 (target);    Down-selection: Early 2017 (target). &lt;p&gt; The Astrophysics Explorer Program SMEX AO and SALMON-2 amendment may contain provisions that differ substantially from this preliminary notice, in which case the provisions in the AO and SALMON-2 amendment will take precedence. The Astrophysics Explorer AO will be based on the Standard PI-led Mission AO Template available at http://soma.larc.nasa.gov/standardao/sao_templates.html      . Proposers should read the Draft Astrophysics SMEX AO and SALMON-2 amendment carefully when they are released. &lt;p&gt; NASA has not approved the issuance of the Astrophysics SMEX AO or SALMON-2 amendment and this notification does not obligate NASA to issue the announcements and solicit proposals. Any costs incurred by prospective investigators in preparing submissions in response to this announcement are incurred completely at the submitter's own risk. &lt;p&gt; Further information will be posted on the Explorer Program Acquisition website at http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/APSMEX	   as that information becomes available. Questions or comments about this intention to release an Astrophysics SMEX AO may be addressed in writing or by E-mail to the Astrophysics Explorer Program Scientist: Dr. Wilton T. Sanders, Ref.: Astrophysics SMEX AO, Astrophysics Division, Mail Stop 3U23, Science Mission Directorate, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546-0001, E-mail: wilton.t.sanders@nasa.gov (subject line to read "Astrophysics SMEX AO"). Responses to all inquiries will be answered by E-mail and also posted weekly at the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) location of the Explorer Program Acquisition website; anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p><br />SCOPE OF SERVICES - NMAN8700-14-00227SRG</p>
<p>PURPOSE and HISTORY:</p>
<p>The NOAA Diving Center (NDC) conducts three Working Diver and Divemaster classes a year to meet the training demands of the NOAA Diving Program (NDP). Two of these courses are offered at the NDC in Seattle; one being in May and the other in September. To address the operational schedules of the NOAA Line Offices and ships, a third class is conducted in the winter. Unfortunately, this is at a time when the climatic and water conditions are too cold to practically and safely train new divers. Because of this, a warm weather location was needed to accommodate the schedule and demands of field.</p>
<p>Due to environmental conditions experienced in Seattle during the winter months, the NOAA Diving Center (NDC) has to look for alternate locations to conduct its training. The NDC is looking for a location suitable to conduct three consecutive weeks of training sometime from mid-January to the end of May timeframe. The NOAA Diving Center has been conducting its January Working Diver/Divemaster classes Florida. The need for a facility that had everything in one location (pool, saltwater lagoon, chambers, etc) had become apparent.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>The Working Diver class is 3 weeks long with only 1 day off. Class schedule and certification requirements only allow for a minimum of travel time between classrooms and in-water training sites. The class schedule runs from 0730 - 1730 and is based on having all amenities in one location. Adding transportation time will add additional days to the schedule and increase cost for the government.</p>
<p>General Location Requirements</p>
<p>1. Ambient air temperatures at a minimum of 60&deg;F during daylight hours.<br />2. Water temperatures at a minimum of 60&deg;F for controlled and open water diving.<br />3. Within 2 hrs of an airport with sufficient capacity and offering daily service.<br />4. Access to a dive boat capable of supporting 24 divers and 10 dive masters for offshore dive training.<br />5. Lodging, groceries, and restaurants within 30 minute of facility.<br />6. Rental cars available at the airport or within a reasonable distance from the airport. <br />7. Located within 20 min from medical facilities with urgent care or Emergency Department.<br />8. Located within 60 min of a clinical hyperbaric treatment facility capable of treating divers.<br />9. Access to water depth of 100 ft for deep dive within 1 hr</p>
<p>Facility Requirements</p>
<p>General<br />1. Classrooms and offices must be collocated, quiet secure with locking doors and windows, have good lighting and HVAC capable of maintaining room temperatures 70-75 degrees Fahrenheit. Two sets of keys will be provided to NOAA at least 2 days prior to the commencement of class. If classrooms and offices are located above the 2nd floor, an elevator must be available for use <br />2. Pool, chamber and sheltered water (min 30 ft) located within 15 mins of classroom/office spaces. <br />3. Bathrooms, showers and changing rooms (separate male and female) adequate for 25 people. <br />4. Refrigerator near the classroom/office location large enough to store lunches for 36 people.<br />5. Onsite parking (within 5 min walking distance of classroom/office facility) for all students and staff<br />6. Facility supplied area (20ft x 50ft) for our shipping container (8ft x 15ft) within 500 ft of scuba cylinder fill station.

 SOURCES SOUGHT   
THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUCEMENT ONLY. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, bids, or quotations. At this time, NO PROJECT PLANS OR SPECIFICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method. The Point Reyes Major Acquisition Buying Office in the Pacific West Region of the National Park Service is conducting market research to understand the numbers and types of contractors who have the capability and are interested in performing laboratory analysis of surface water quality samples and monthly sterilization and autoclaving of sample bottles at Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin County, California.  
The U.S. Department of Interior, National Park Service is contemplating the issuance of a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for laboratory service. This is part of a long-term monitoring program of the San Francisco Bay Area Network of the National Park Service. Laboratory tests will generate data used to inform land managers of long-term trends, evaluation of prior mitigation measures, and assist in the identification of sites in need of management actions. Ultimately, use of these data will help guide natural resource management decisions.
Capable contractors must be able to provided courier service and will need to be available Monday through Friday; field sampling may occur at a variety of times during the week, often requiring multiple pick-ups from Point Reyes National Seashore headquarters on different days and at various times of day. Additional flexibility in lab scheduling (with short notice) is needed for the unpredictable nature of seasonal storm sampling; sample drop-off may be necessary on weekends, requiring a local drop-off site within reasonable driving distance (one hour) from Point Reyes National Seashore headquarters. Stringent hold times are established in our monitoring protocol, so timely processing of samples must be guaranteed before beginning field work. The main parameters to be tested will be TKN (requiring a maximum method detection limit [MDL] of 0.25 mg/L) and nitrate as nitrogen (requiring a maximum MDL of 0.15 mg/L). Proper QA/QC procedures should be conducted by laboratory staff, and reported with each set of sample results (which should be emailed within two weeks of sampling day). Technical support and sampling guidance over the phone may be needed occasionally. There is also a need for sterilization and autoclaving of approximately 100 sample bottles per month that will need to be picked up and returned to Point Reyes National Seashore headquarters by the laboratory courier service. 
Interested contractors able to perform the type of work detailed above should PROVIDE THEIR COMPANY OR ENTITY NAME, ADDRESS, DUNS, AND CONTACT INFORMATION FOR PRIMARY POINTS OF CONTACT, AND ANY RELEVANT INFORMATION DEMONSTRATING YOUR CAPABILITY TO PERFORM THE WORK to NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, ATTN: Liset Gomez, Contract Specialist, Point Reyes National Seashore, 1 Bear Valley Road, Point Reyes Station, CA 94956, or email to Liset_Gomez@nps.gov. ALL INFORMATION MUST BE RECEIVED BY THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE NO LATER THAN CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON NOVEMBER 19, 2013.
Interested contractors must be currently registered (or be able to be registered prior to any future award) in the System for Award Management (SAM) at the official SAM website www.sam.gov (SAM registration is FREE - beware fraudulent websites posing as SAM and attempting to collect registration fee).
Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. An organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published online at the websites of Federal Business Opportunities and Fed Connect.

<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI)/<br />MRI Technologist to be located at Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay Cuba</p>
<p>Objective: Navy Medicine is seeking to locate a magnetic resonance imaging technologist at Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay Cuba. The logistics of placing an individual at the base hospital present several challenges due to the remote location and associated housing and transportation issues.</p>
<p>Notional Concept: It is the goal of Navy Medicine to place an MRI technologist at NH Guantanamo. Due to the nature of the hospital's mission and the uncertainty of injuries/illnesses, the technologist(s) would need to be available after hours for emergent care as well as normal clinic working hours. The technologist would also provide general radiologic technologist services when not performing MRI duties. Some options include but are not limited to: A rotational schedule, such as three to four week with replacement by another individual; one year terms, etc. It is anticipated that any solicitation resulting from the RFI would allow for the offeror to propose alternative staffing methodologies.</p>
<p>Quantifiable factors for consideration include the following.</p>
<p>1. This would be an unaccompanied tour.</p>
<p>2. Quarters are available, either hotel-like or assigned housing for longer stays. Navy Lodge contact information is available on line for pricing https://www.navy-lodge.com/lodge_page.html?p_lodge_number=03. Estimated pricing for housing is below.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation: T2017<br />Agency/Office: Defense Health Agency<br />Location: Contract Operations Division - Aurora (Colorado)<br />Title: TRICARE PROGRAM - MANAGED CARE SUPPORT CONTRACT Request for Information (RFI)
<p>DESCRIPTION:<br />DEFENSE HEALTH AGENCY (DHA) is contemplating the future generation of managed care contracts which includes cost reimbursable line items, fixed price line items, and requirements line items for the TRICARE Program of the Military Health System (MHS) in the United States to support active duty service members (ADSMs); active duty family members (ADFMs); retired service members and their eligible family members; survivors; Medal of Honor recipients; qualified former spouses; National Guard and Reserve members and their family members (including qualified non-active duty members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve, Retired Reserve, and certain members of the Individual Ready Reserve). TRICARE supplements the care provided in Department of Defense (DoD) Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs), as well as provides care to those eligible beneficiaries living in regions without access to MTFs. The period of performance is anticipated to be a transition-in phase of 14 months, plus five one-year options, and phase-out (if exercised).</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry's feedback on capabilities currently available to meet the later described MHS requirement. The intent of this RFI is to accomplish the following:</p>
<p>To gather information from potential offerors to be utilized by the DHA TRICARE Program as support in our continuous market research for upcoming contract requirements. The information will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research in determining the proper acquisition strategy, type of contract, and to achieve its overall objectives under the TRICARE Program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>DISCUSSION: <br />TRICARE is comprised of three health care options: Prime, Standard, and Extra. <br />TRICARE Prime is similar to a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) with a Point of Service Option and requires beneficiary enrollment. All ADSMs are TRICARE Prime enrollees, although they are required to receive all of their care either in the MTF or under special rules that apply to Active Duty health care, further explained in the TRICARE Operations Manual, Chapter 17. ADFMs may elect to enroll and are not required to pay an annual enrollment fee; other eligible beneficiaries pay an annual enrollment fee to enroll in TRICARE Prime. <br />TRICARE Extra, which requires no enrollment, is an option in which the beneficiary may choose to use a provider in a TRICARE contractor-developed network, at a reduced cost-share for a particular instance of care, but is not restricted to use of the provider network. <br />TRICARE Standard is a fee-for-service option, essentially the program formerly called the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), in which the beneficiary is free to use any authorized provider. The three options of TRICARE are described fully in 32 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 199.17 and 199.18. The MHS is organized into three TRICARE Regions within the United States and coverage extends overseas.</p>
<p>CONTRACT PURPOSE:<br />DHA is contemplating the award of a contract utilizing a full and open competition acquisition approach to provide support to MTFs in providing health care services in the United States to ADSMs; ADFMs; retired service members and their eligible family members; survivors; Medal of Honor recipients; qualified former spouses; National Guard and Reserve members and their family members (including qualified non-active duty members of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve, Retired Reserve, and certain members of the Individual Ready Reserve). The Uniformed Services include the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marine Corps, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service (PHS).</p>
<p>The anticipated future contract will supplement DoD MTFs by providing medical care provider networks and support services in required Prime Service Areas (PSAs) in the following location: the 50 United States and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>CONTRACT OBJECTIVES:<br />The following performance-based objectives are to be accomplished in an anticipated future contract:<br />&bull;Objective 1 - In partnership with the MHS, optimize the delivery of health care services in the direct care system (see the definition of Military Treatment Facility Optimization in the TRICARE Operations Manual, Appendix B) for all MHS beneficiaries (active duty personnel, MTF enrollees, civilian network enrollees, and non-enrollees).<br />&bull;Objective 2 - Beneficiary satisfaction at the highest level possible throughout the period of performance, through the delivery of world-class health care as well as customer-friendly program services. Beneficiaries must be completely satisfied with each and every service provided by the Contractor during each and every contact.<br />&bull;Objective 3 - Attain "best value health care" (See TRICARE Operations Manual, Appendix B) services in support of the MHS mission utilizing commercial practices when practical.<br />&bull;Objective 4 - Fully operational services and systems at the start of health care delivery and minimal disruption to beneficiaries and MTFs.<br />&bull;Objective 5 - Full and real-time access to Contractor maintained data to support DoD financial planning, health system planning, medical resource management, clinical management, disease management, and contract administration activities.</p>
<p>MAJOR TASKS AND SERVICES:<br />The following tasks and services are anticipated to be the major parts of the contract's scope:<br />&bull;General medical care provider networks in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia<br />&bull;Claims processing and provider reimbursement (cashless/claimless for the ADSM and ADSM beneficiaries)<br />&bull;Customer service<br />&bull;Program enrollment and processing related fees/premiums<br />&bull;Beneficiary and provider education<br />&bull;Medical management and case management for beneficiaries<br />&bull;Referral management for care which beneficiaries receive for specialty care</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: The following questions and request for information are provided for consideration during this "market research" phase of the acquisition. Please review and provide your responses to the Government for possible consideration/alternatives for satisfying mission needs of the TRICARE Program.</p>
<p>Question #1: In its next generation of Managed Care Support Services for the TRICARE Program the Government is seeking ways to achieve greater operational efficiencies and cost savings while improving healthcare services for program beneficiaries. To this purpose the Government is seeking industry input regarding the consideration of consolidating the current support provided by three regional MCSCs into a single national MCSC contract to be awarded for the TRICARE Program. <br />a.What economies of scale and other cost savings could the Government expect to achieve by consolidating the TRICARE Program's managed care support activities under one national contract?<br />b.What are reasons that the TRICARE Program's managed care support activities should not be consolidated under one national contract?<br />c.What are any additional costs which the Government may incur (that are not incurred under the present managed care support services contracts) as a result of the consolidation of the TRICARE Program's managed care support activities under one national contract?</p>
<p>Question #2: Considering solicitation characteristics such as contract type, options, multiple versus single award, performance incentives, what specific solicitation characteristics would encourage your organization to submit an offer in response to a solicitation for the managed care support services of the TRICARE Program under one national contract?</p>
<p>Question #3: What solicitation characteristics would discourage or prevent your organization from submitting an offer for the managed care support services of the TRICARE Program under one national contract?<br />Question #4: What would be the level of interest by commercial health plans in submitting an offer for a future subsequent MCSC contract once an initial single, national TRICARE Program contract for managed care support services was awarded? <br />RESPONSES REQUIRED:<br />Responses to this RFI should be no more than a total of 15pages (including cover page). Responses should be submitted to Laura.Sells@dha.mil no later than December 13,2013, 1500 MST. Please include reference data for a designated point of contact (name, title, address, phone/fax, email).</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAR SHARING CUSTOMER AGENCY MEETING</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; GSA is pursuing an array of car sharing initiatives to help federal agencies reduce costs, improve service and optimize their use of vehicles. GSA issued a Request for Information (RFI) in search of car sharing best practices and innovations that will allow agencies to focus on their core missions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the coming months, GSA will launch a car sharing pilot program in Washington DC, New York City, Boston, and Chicago to immediately begin exploring how car sharing can work across multi-federal agencies in large metropolitan cities. The goal is to drive agency cost savings while simultaneously allowing the agency to focus resources on their mission instead of ancillary services that GSA can provide more efficiently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; GSA's goal is to help all agencies explore if car sharing is effective and under what circumstances can an agency achieve success. GSA is hosting a <strong>Customer Agency Meeting on November 21, 2013 from 1 - 4:00pm EST.</strong> The meeting will be held at our offices 1800 F St NW, Washington, DC. Agencies will also have the option of attending via WebEx. If you are interested, please <strong>RSVP to Iman Freeman at iman.freeman@gsa.gov by Monday, November 18, 2013. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A link to RFI can be found here: https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=core&amp;id=f42554e0b4780fabafc9fa7881bc0720</p>

This announcement and any modifications to this announcement will be open through 12 November 2014 in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps). White Papers (WP) and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. WPs (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by a panel of government experts using the following criteria: Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered; and potential contributions to the Navy Propulsion, Power and Energy objectives to include (1) relevance to the stated technology areas of interest; (2) anticipated operational military (or commercial, if applicable) utility; (3) ability of proposed system/study to be rapidly ready for transition; (4) suitability for transition to Navy systems; and (5) projected affordability of transitioning the technology to the fleet Other evaluation criteria, of lesser importance but equal to each other are; The offeror's capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives and the realism and reasonableness of cost, including proposed cost sharing. No further criteria will be used in the evaluation. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds. Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated. Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Specific reporting requirements cited on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) shall be specified within each contract award. At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report. Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals or White Papers (WP) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate. BRIEFNESS IS DESIRABLE - WPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM. Cost estimates in WPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged. Offerors of those WPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal. One original, and later, if invited, of each formal cost and technical proposal are to be submitted. WPs and Proposals shall be submitted to: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Highway 547, Bldg 120-180, Code 2.5.2.3.2, Attn: Jillian Kohler, jillian.kohler@navy.mil , Contract Specialist, Lakehurst, NJ 08733.

<DESC>The objective for ANSWER is to research, design, test, and transition resilient, adaptive spectrum warfare technologies and techniques to enable mission assured warfighting capabilities in contested and denied environments consistent with A2/AD scenarios. With an ever changing environment between red and blue forces, the ability to control the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is a key requirement to achieving success in warfighter operations. This is a daunting task under benign conditions and becomes even more of a challenge as adversaries are able to employ various denial capabilities.
<p>The most challenging denial scenario is normally referred to as the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) scenario. If one can successfully conduct EMS operations under A2/AD conditions, then successful operations in other less challenging environments should be achievable as well. To accomplish this, the warfighter needs to be able to control adversary use of EMS, ensure friendly access to/use of EMS, protect sensor/avionics end nodes, establish/maintain secure communications/data links in dense EMS environments; and assure the availability of accurate position, navigation, and timing (PNT) information. The ANSWER program is designed to address these challenges.</p>

<DESC>i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) The solicitation number associated with this requirement is BATF111213. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP)</p>
<p>(iii) This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-70.</p>
<p>(iv) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 721110 and the business size standard is $30.0 Million (Offerors must have soliciting NAICS Code listed in the System for Award Management (SAM) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at the time of proposal submission. If not, proposal will not be considered). This requirement is a small business set-aside. The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program is not applicable.<br /><br />(v) See Attachment A - Supplies or Services and Prices/Rates for CLIN structure.</p>
<p>(vi) The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has a requirement for hotel accommodations in Huntsville, AL. (as described in the Statement of Work (SOW at Attachment B).</p>
<p>(vii) ATF intends to award a Firm Fixed price Purchase Order. The period of performance will consist four (4) Months.</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jul 2013) applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>Parties responding to this solicitation who believe they can provide the required hotel accommodations described herein may submit their proposal in accordance with their standard commercial practices (e.g., on company letterhead, formal quote form, etc.) and must include the following information: 1) company's complete mailing and remittance addresses; 2) discounts for prompt payment if applicable; 3) Dun &amp; Bradstreet number; 4) copy of System for Award Management (SAM) Registration (which may be accessed at https://www.unitedstatesbusinessregistration.us); 5) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code and; 6) pricing in accordance with the CLIN specified herein (see Attachment A- Supplies or Services and Prices/Rates) and; 7) technical response addressing capability to provide hotel accommodation in accordance with the requirements herein inclusive of past performance information with no less than three (3) references.</p>
<p>To aid in the evaluation process, proposals shall be clearly and concisely written, indexed/cross indexed, and logically assembled. Format requirements and page limitations are established to facilitate the ease of evaluation and to assist in determining whether Offerors are able to concisely communicate a clear understanding of the requirement in their proposed approach and capabilities. Prospective Offerors are asked to bear in mind that all material submitted should be directly pertinent to the requirements of this solicitation and that extraneous promotional material or brochures shall not be submitted nor evaluated. All pages of each volume shall be appropriately numbered (i.e., "Page 1 of 5," etc.), and identified with the name of the Offeror, the date, and the solicitation number. Offerors shall furnish the proposal in two separate volumes as follows:</p>
<p>VOLUME 1 - TECHNICAL:</p>
<p>The Offeror's technical submission should demonstrate the firm's capability to provide the requirements outlined in the RFP. Additionally, all offerors must submit copies of their Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Certification and State Fire Marshall's Safety Inspection along with proposal. If not, proposal will not be considered or evaluated. Offerors shall provide a technical proposal that addresses the following evaluation factors:</p>
<p>1) Lodging Accommodations/Amenities -The offeror must demonstrate the capability to successfully meet the required specifics and amenities as described in the SOW.</p>
<p>2) Site Visit - The offeror must be available to allow ATF Representatives entry into one or more rooms of the accommodations being proposed to fulfill the requirement.</p>
<p>3) Past Performance - Past performance may cite federal, state, local government, commercial sources, or not for profit sources, and should highlight the company's key role in the past performance being documented. This information shall consist of a one (1) page introductory matrix listing the offerors' past performance references. The offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) references. The offeror should include rationale supporting the assertion of relevance for each reference. These references should also be from different contracts. To be considered, past performance data may not be older than three (3) years (normally 3, but could vary based on the industry) from the date of the proposal, and may include active contracts; if over one year old. Further, offerors should include a list of all relevant ATF on-going contracts or contracts completed for the specified period.</p>
<p>Past performance references must be as having provided hotel accommodations as a prime contractor on previous or current contracts that are similar in size, scope, and complexity as identified in the SOW.</p>
<p>Offerors shall forward the Past and Present Performance Survey (Attachment C), to offeror's references. The references shall forward their completed surveys to the Contracting Officer, NOT BACK TO THE OFFEROR. The surveys shall be delivered via email directly from the offeror's references to james.huff@atf.gov.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to use publicly available reports and data from the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) found on the web at http://www.ppirs. The Government may also use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by offerors. For each reference, provide:</p>
<p>a. Reference Name (Company or Entity)<br />b. Program Title<br />c. Contracting Agency/Private Company<br />d. Contract Number/Task Order Number (if applicable)<br />e. Brief description of the contract effort, including results and successes<br />f. Type of Contract<br />g. Period of Performance<br />h. Original contract dollar value and current or actual dollar value<br />i. Actual completion date<br />j. Contact names, addresses, telephone numbers, Fax numbers and e-mail addresses of current, or last (if contract completed) Program Director/Manager and/or Contract Manager.</p>
<p>Page Limitation: The technical proposal submission shall be limited to five (5) one-sided pages, excluding certification documents, state fire marshall's safety inspection, past performance reference information and any cover letter/title pages. OFFERORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL ONLY EVALUATE THE FIRST FIVE (5) PAGES OF ANY TECHNICAL PROPOSAL THAT EXCEEDS THE PAGE LIMITATION. Please do not include additional information as an attached appendix.</p>
<p>In order for the technical proposal to be evaluated strictly on the merit of the material submitted, NO PRICE/RATE INFORMATION IS TO BE INCLUDED IN VOLUME I.</p>
<p>The evaluation and award procedures in FAR 15.305 will be applied to this acquisition.</p>
<p>VOLUME II - COST/PRICE/RATES (non-rated)</p>
<p>ATF is seeking hotel accommodations for students and instructors attending explosives training for courses on Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, AL. The proposed rates must be at or below GSA's established per diem rates throughout the base and option periods of the contract.</p>
<p>(ix) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors (listed in descending order or relative importance) shall be used to evaluate proposals:</p>
<p>A. Lodging Accommodations/Amenities<br />B. Site Visit<br />C. Past Performance<br />D. Price/Rates</p>
<p>Factor A through C are referred to as the technical factors. Factors A through D are in order of relative importance. Factor A through C (when combined) are approximately equal to price. As the technical proposals approach equality, price will become more important in making the award determination.</p>
<p>In awarding the proposed contract, ATF will select a contractor who presents the overall best value to the Government, considering the technical merit of the contractor's proposal. In the event that two or more proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the offeror submitting the lowest proposed prices/rates. It should be noted that award may also be made to other than the lowest proposed prices/rates if the Government determines that a price/rate premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated proposal, if the Government determines that a price/rate premium is not warranted.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to make an award on the basis of initial proposals without discussions (although the right to conduct discussions, if necessary, is reserved). Offerors are therefore cautioned that each initial proposal should contain the offeror's best at or below GSA per diem prices/rates.</p>
<p>Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Technical proposals submitted in response to this RFP will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>1) Lodging Accommodations/Amenities - The degree to which offeror demonstrated the<br />capability to successfully provide lodging accommodations and amenities as described in <br />the SOW.</p>
<p>2) Site Visit - The degree to which a physical visit to the proposed facility meets the needs of the Government.</p>
<p>3) Past Performance - The extent to which the Offeror's past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successfully providing the described accommodations. The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the PPIRS. The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts or references identified by offeror. The information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination. An offeror without a record of past performance for whom information on relevant past performance is not available will be evaluated as "neutral".</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price/rates for all options to the total price/rates for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices/rates are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(x) 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2013). Offerors shall provide representations and certifications (FAR 52.212-3) electronically via website at https://www.unitedstatesbusinessregistration.us. A copy of the on-line representations and certifications submission shall be included in the offeror's response.</p>
<p>(xi) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Sept 2013), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xii) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Sept 2013), applies to this acquisition. In addition, the following clauses are also incorporated by reference to implement provisions of law or executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />&nbsp;<br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br /><br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br /><br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br /><br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br /><br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br /><br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<SUBJECT>Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1)
<SOLNBR>DARPA-BAA-14-01
<RESPDATE>011614
<ARCHDATE>05122014
<CONTACT>Chris Glista, Email DARPA-BAA-14-01@darpa.mil
<DESC>The objective of the Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program is to demonstrate a reusable first stage launch vehicle capable of carrying and deploying an upper stage that inserts 3,000 to 5,000 lb. payloads into Low Earth Orbit (LEO), designed for less than $5M per launch for an operational system. Technologies derived from the XS-1 program will enable routine space launch capabilities with aircraft like cost, operability and reliability.  The long-term intent is for XS-1 technologies to be transitioned to support not only next-generation launch for Government and commercial customers, but also global reach hypersonic and space access aircraft.
<p>Current space launch vehicles are very expensive, have no surge capability and must be contracted years in advance (i.e., long call up times).  For example, the U.S. Air Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) and Minotaur IV launch vehicles have dramatically increased in cost since the inception of the programs.  In an era of declining budgets and proliferating foreign threats to U.S. air and space assets the need for responsive, affordable access to space is increasingly critical.  XS-1 will directly address the need for small payloads launched using low cost and operationally efficient concepts of employment (CONEMPs) based on a "clean pad" approach.  Moreover, it will provide a foundation to build upon for larger launch systems in the future.</p>
<p>It is also envisioned that the XS-1 program will mature many of the key technologies and operational processes needed to enable future hypersonic aircraft and space access vehicles.  Missions performed by such follow-on vehicles could include hypersonic technology maturation and routine global reach intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) as well as other military applications.  The potential to transition XS-1 designs, technology and corresponding operating concepts to future aircraft is an important opportunity for the program.</p>

QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />All CLINs 200 - 1,000 Bundles Three (3) business days<br />All CLINs 1,001 - 2,000 Bundles Five (5) business days<br />If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:<br /><br />REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br />[Contracting Officer insert specific details]<br />ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br />All CLINs 200 - 1,000 Bundles Five (5) business days<br />All CLINs 1,001 - 2,000 Bundles Seven (7) business days<br />Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.

The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<DESC>Solicitation N00421-14-T-0036 is issued as a synopsis/solicitation. The Government intends to purchase on a Firm Fixed-Price basis and to solicit/negotiate the proposed purchase order on Sole Source basis with Santos Human Inc. under the authority of FAR Part 12, FAR Part 13, and 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business set-a-side. Santos Human Inc. is the developer of highly realistic, biomechanical human model that predicts static posture, dynamic motion, joint strength, joint angles, and development of fatigue. Santos Human Inc is the manufacturer and holds the proprietary rights of their human modeling program. NAVAIR currently uses Santos Human modeling program and desires to upgrade its functionality. The upgrade will improve the in-house capability to perform anthropometric studies and evaluations and develop models that utilize virtual aircraft cockpits. This will further develop capabilities to reduce the time and cost associated with using actual Naval Aircraft, pilots, and maintainers in the attainment of Anthropometric Restriction Code (ARC) data. The Santos Human model is already fielded in NAVAIR &lsquo;S Human Systems Department and utilizing a source other than Santos Human Inc. would require conducting new certifications, testing, trainining at a significant cost to the government. It is imperative that the original source be used to interface and configured to the current system. Requirement is for Exact Match Only (MFR/Part Number, Model Number, etc...); ONLY New Equipment, NO Remanufactured, and all items must be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. Similar or Substitute products will not be accepted.
<p>Please see attached RFQ.</p>

<p>Notice Type: Solicitation This acquisition is being solicited using full and open competition. <br />NACIS CODE: 221330<br />Synopsis: A Firm-Fixed-Price Contract combined with a single-award IDIQ component will be utilized for this acquisition. This will provide a lower level of risk to the Government as described in FAR 16.202-1, place maximum risk upon the contractor, and be an incentive for the contractor to perform effectively and efficiently. The contract includes one base year and four (4) option years to be exercised at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. This method is more appropriate than a multiyear order as the maintenance is to be performed annually. The Government anticipates making award without discussions.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br> Technical Factors - Standard - - Acceptable - - Unacceptable <br>  1. Provide all materials and professional services needed to perform required technical survey testing, professional continuing education training, and the evaluation of submitted test results for the continued accreditation of the Department of Pathology and Area Laboratory Services (DPALS) <br> 2. Provide all analytical survey materials, to include: samples, electronic online surveys, result reporting forms or electronic reporting capability, and graded/evaluated survey results. <br>  3. Delivery schedule for contracted test kits and online test surveys shall conform to the shipping dates established by the contractor for the calendar year. <br>  4. The contractor shall grade/evaluate the submitted results and provide copies of the evaluation reports to the laboratory no later than 45 days after the suspense date for result submission <br> 5.  Evaluation reports shall include the values reported by the laboratory, identification of the method against which the results evaluation is based, and a graded comparison to the established target reference values for each tested analyte. <br> The Government will use the following standards to evaluate Technical:  <br> (1) Acceptable - Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. <br> (2)  Unacceptable - Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. <br> The Government intends to make an award without conducting discussions.  After the initial evaluation of proposals is completed, if one or more proposals are rated Acceptable for both Technical and Past Performance, the initial evaluation will become the final evaluation of proposals and award will be made without discussions to the lowest priced offeror.  If any technical subfactor is rated Unacceptable after the initial evaluation, the technical factor will be rated Unacceptable and the proposal will no longer be considered for award.  If all proposals submitted result in an unacceptable technical evaluation then clarifications may be necessary.  The Government evaluation team will evaluate the offeror's response to the Government exchanges with offerors. .   <br> (3)FACTOR : PRICE. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness based on anticipated adequate price competition.  Once the technical and past performance factors are rated as acceptable, contract award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror with the lowest price. <br> Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br> A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.   <br>  <br> 52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (AUG 2013) ALTERNATE I (APR 2011) <br>  <br>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>(6) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award. The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(7) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p><br />(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on a Contractor Proposal Form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p><br />(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>(8) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p><br />(9) METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each contract line item/CLIN as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule of Supplies/Services as follows:</p>
<p>An item/CLIN may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that item/CLIN have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each item/CLIN may be waived by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar items/CLINS.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.212-4 will be returned.</p>
<p>(a) Each invoice shall contain the following information:<br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor<br />(2) Contract or Delivery/Task Order Number/Modification No.<br />(3) Vessel name<br />(4) Name of the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer<br />(5) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price<br />(6) Percentage of completion for each CLIN identified <br />(7) Shipping and Payment Terms<br />(8) Invoice Routing Code (IRC) assigned by the Coast Guard <br />(9) Annotate on the invoice indicating that the contractor represents a small business for accelerated payment purposes.<br />(10) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number</p>

Therefore, to facilitate payment, the DUNS number shall be recorded on every invoice submitted to the US Coast Guard.</p>
<p>All payments for partial performance rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend progress payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subsequent agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified by the designated billing office and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) as accurate and complete.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration.</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: "THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER (To be assigned upon contract award).</p>

Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This is an amendment to solicitation W91ZLK-14-T-0006. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions regarding the solicitation. <br>  <br> PLEASE NOTE: Building 501 has been amended to Building 370. Building 501 will not have water delivered. The Performance Work Statement has been uploaded to reflect this change.  <br>  <br>  <br> Q. We only produce purified water, but the bid calls for spring water. Would we be able to deliver purified water? <br>  <br> A. YES, purified water may be supplied as well as spring water. <br>  <br>  <br> Q. For the three locations that indicate racks, will there be forklifts available to unload the racks? <br>  <br> A. Forklifts are available for use at all but one location (Building 370) that involves racks.  <br>  <br>  <br> Q. For the three locations that require racks (501, Superpond, and TW1 B-269B), the amount of racks requested would be 800 bottles a month which is more than the 700 bottle per month estimated quantity. Will those three locations be getting extra water delivered initially, but typically we will replace less racks than indicated in the proposal?  <br>  <br> A. The racks will not be completely replaced for each delivery. For each delivery location with racks, the contractor shall replace any empty bottles on the rack with full bottles. <br>  <br>  <br> Q. Do you have an estimate on how many racks/crates we would need to furnish as a part of the bid? <br>  <br> A. There is an estimated seven racks needed total for this requirement. <br>  <br>  <br> Q. Do we reserve the right to charge for any bottles, racks, and crates that are not returned to us at the end of the service? <br>  <br> A. This is left to the discretion of the contractor's proposal.  <br>  <br>  <br> Q. There do not appear to be any requirements for the water to comply with source certified and approved facilities (MIL-STD 3006C)? <br>  <br> A. There are no requirements for MIL-STD 3006C. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

Use of this exception applies when competition will be restricted to sources that can supply the brand name requirement. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR COMMERCIAL LITHIUM ION CELL LOTS AND ACCEPTANCE TESTING .  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. &lt;p&gt; The purpose of this amendment is to add 52.212-2 EvaluationCommercial Items. &lt;p&gt; EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) &lt;p&gt; (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: - Provide information on no more than 3 relevant past contracts with the Government; including past work with similar quality requirements -Technical information shall not exceed 25 pages, not including the Requirement Compliance Matrix, which shall be submitted with the offerors proposal. -Discuss the cell test approach. The offerors justification shall demonstrate ability to execute the proposed battery test approach which satisfies the EP-WI-031 Specification for Acceptance Testing of Commercial Lithium ion Cell Lots. -Submit a compliance matrix found in Section 8 of the Statement of Work, which specifies whether each applicable requirement of the end item specification shall be met or taken exception to. -Address product nonconformance, material certification, and process change control considerations. Specifically, the offerors proposal must provide a discussion of how cell non-conformances will be addressed, whether cell manufacturer certification of conformance will be provided, and how cell test process changes will be managed. -Identify any required tests which pose significant risk to accomplishing the acquisition and test requirements per the required schedule.  Cost impacts associated with such risk must be identified and submitted with the offerors proposal.  The offeror may want to include risk mitigation discussion. -Describe the qualifications and experience of the personnel to be assigned to the project. Additionally, descriptions of the offerors resources, facilities, and equipment (i.e., including manufacturing, test, computational, analytical, experimental, etc.) proposed for use during the program, including the availability and commitment of the facilities and equipment. The proposal shall also address the same from any subcontractors or outside organizations along with the role of each. - Provide price information for delivery of each of the two required cell lots Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. &lt;p&gt; The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. &lt;p&gt; Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on November 1, 2013. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5 and 36.209, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Scott AFB may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br />Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO).

Product improvements, integrations, and testing.   <br/><br/>III.    Training, overhaul, depot-level, field maintenance support, recapitalization/reset of CROWS, and general engineering support, as required.<br/><br/>The CROWS will be built to a detail specification.  The detail specification includes the performance requirements and technical drawings.  The detail specification states the design requirements, how the requirements are to be achieved and how the components are to be fabricated or constructed.  The detail specification does not include technical drawings and assembly procedures for some sub-assemblies, which are to be made by qualified directed sources at least until the First Article Testing phase.  This approach will ensure a very high level of commonality between the new CROWS producer and commonality/interchangeability with existing CROWS systems.  The U.S. Government will provide the aforementioned data on a Digital Video Disc (DVD).  Most data will be in a Portable Data Format (pdf) format but some data may be provided in other formats. <br/><br/>Below is a list of items that are planned to be provided as part of the formal solicitation: <br/> <br/> - Detail Specification<br/> - Performance requirements<br/> - Technical Drawings<br/> - Specifications and Interface Control Documents for those components for which detailed technical drawings are not provided.<br/> - Solid models for castings including machining drawings<br/> - Gerber formatted printed circuit board layouts with pick and place data<br/> - Assembly procedures<br/> - List of approved sources for sub-assemblies at various levels of production build <br/> - Quality requirements <br/> - Test requirements<br/> - Executable software files<br/><br/>The software code and associated documentation will not be released nor will prospective contractors have access to it at any time. Only the executable software files will be provided. The software code will be managed by the U.S. Government. Any software changes required in the execution of the contract will be addressed through a software change process between the U.S. Government and the prospective Contractor. <br/><br/>The design/production data described above will be provided upon request after the Request for Proposals release provided that all prerequisite paper work (described below) is properly completed, submitted, and approved.  <br/><br/>For U.S. & Canadian Companies:  In order to process a request for the data, each requester (U.S. & Canada) must complete and submit the following forms:<br/><br/> - DD2345 Military Critical Technical Data Agreement<br/> - AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire<br/> - Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement<br/> - Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Agreement<br/><br/>The agreement will include requirements for limiting distribution of data and the destruction of data provided or reproduced. <br/><br/>For Other Foreign Companies:  All other foreign companies shall be compliant with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) requirements.  The countries of Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Norway are exempt from ITAR restrictions in accordance with 22 CFR 125.4(c) for the Pre-Solicitation Conference and solicitation; however these countries shall be ITAR compliant before a contract award.

<a href="mailto:jeffrey.pacuska@us.army.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (SPS)</a>
<DESC>The U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Command (NSRDEC), Natick, MA is conducting a market investigation to identify domestic products, suppliers, and manufacturers of retroreflective materials with advanced interface and adhesion technologies that are capable of meeting military requirements for retroreflection, launderability and abrasion resistance of the near infrared patch on the uniform as described by purchase description Patch and Brassard, Identification, Infrared Retroreflective (CO/PD-05-06A, attached).  <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army is interested in identifying firms with products, technologies and capabilities to provide a more durable, launderable and abrasion resistant IR patch. The IR patch shall be permanently affixed to the garment and must meet the launderability and abrasion resistance requirements as described in the attached purchase description.  <br>    <br>  Currently the IR patches are suffering layer delamination and in turn a decrease in operational effectiveness as a result of laundering and abrasive field conditions. The abrasive field conditions are also causing the gloss finish of the patches to become scratched and matte, which hinders their retroreflective response. The U.S. Army is interested in identifying potential solutions to this layer delamination and surface marring so that an improved more durable IR patch can be issued to the solider.  <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army is specifically interested in information pertaining to one or more of the following and will consider all potential solutions for the incorporation of one or more solutions:  <br>    <br>  1)	Alternate means of adhering the layers of the IR tape material together.   <br>    <br>  The current IR tape material is used, but an alternate means of adhering the layers together is suggested.  The modified IR tape shall be affixed to the uniform with the current sewing procedure and shall be capable of passing AATCC Test Method 150: Dimensional Changes of Garments after Home Laundering for launderability and the After Abrasion test method as described in section 4.6.2 of the attached purchase description for abrasion resistance.  <br>    <br>  2)	Alternative permanent affixation methods to sewing on the current IR patch.   <br>    <br>  The current IR tape material is used, but the proposed method of affixing it to the uniform is one that does not puncture the film.  This affixation method shall be capable of passing AATCC Test Method 150: Dimensional Changes of Garments after Home Laundering for launderability and the After Abrasion test method as described in section 4.6.2 of the attached purchase description for abrasion resistance. Affixation methods may include, but are not limited to:  <br>    <br>  Removable backing: IR patches peel and stick to uniform for easy replacement if/when needed.  <br>    <br>  Hot air sealing  <br>    <br>  Glue line bonding  <br>    <br>  Any other affixation technique that will not destructively puncture the thin film.  <br>    <br>  3)	Total replacement of the current IR patch.  <br>    <br>  New development of an IR tape material that meets the technical requirements as stated in CO/PD-05-06A, is permanently affixed by means that do not facilitate layer delamination, and shows improved abrasion resistance over the current material. The newly developed material must pass AATCC Test Method 150: Dimensional Changes of Garments after Home Laundering for launderability and the After Abrasion test method as described in section 4.6.2 of the attached PD for abrasion resistance. The tape thickness must not exceed 0.014-0.015 inches and must weigh between 230 and 270 grams, it shall be scratch proof, non-marring and shall not crack, melt, or lose color or infrared retroreflective properties. The retroreflectivity of the IR material shall be tested at three orientations in accordance with ASTM E810 and as described in section 4.6.1 both before and after laundering and abrasion tests. The finished end item shall not present a health hazard to the user.  <br>    <br>  The findings from this Market Research effort may impact future solicitations related to this requirement. This Market Research is not a solicitation as defined by FAR 2.101, and the Government is not requesting offers for proposals at this time. This is a Request for Information and does not constitute a solicitation or request for proposal. This is a market survey for planning purposes. If a solicitation is issued, the Government does not guarantee that it will be issued to RFI respondents. The Government is also requesting that restrictive or proprietary markings not be used in response to the RFI. The information received under this announcement may be used for developing acquisition strategy and refining operational requirements. Capability Statements, including attachments, are limited to ten (10) pages. Any Capability Statements, including attachments, that are not submitted in MS WORD and/or MS EXCEL or PDF format will be rejected and considered nonresponsive.  Interested sources shall include information regarding a firm's experience, personnel, and facilities.  Information should include product cost, technical information (i.e., technical literature, data and illustrations, photographs, patents), relevant company background/experience, and a sample (optional).  Firms responding shall indicate whether or not they are a small business.  Any information/samples submitted will not be returned.  If a firm chooses to submit samples, no payment will be made by the Government for such samples.  <br>    <br>  No telephonic submissions will be honored. All product information shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. Interested parties should respond by December 8th, 2013.   <br>  Address any questions about this request for information to Megan Hoey via e-mail at:  <br>    <br>  Megan.L.Hoey.civ@mail.mil  <br>    <br>  Or the following address:  <br>    <br>  Megan Hoey  <br>  Natick Soldier RD&E Center  <br>  15 Kansas St  <br>  Natick, MA 01760  <br>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Acquisition Operations (OAO), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, New Jersey 07724, issued a sole source award to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) under the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5), "when a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made through another agency or from a specified source", as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5.  For this action, 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), known as the Veterans First Contracting Program, provides the authority to directly contract with a SDVOSB.  Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract VA118-14-D-0002, was awarded to Tridec Technologies, LLC., 6990 Drywood Place, Huber Heights, Ohio 45424, for the execution of new requirements to include integration of the Virtual Office of Acquisition (VOA) with the Office of Information Technology (OIT) Budget Tracking Tool (BTT), enhancements to the existing Acquisition Task Order Management System (ATOMS), and other necessary enhancements to VOA.  VOA is currently in the process of integrating with various VA acquisition systems to streamline the process of capturing and tracking acquisition data, reducing data entry duplication in multiple systems, and ensuring data is accurate and consistent among systems.  These requirements are due to the evolving requirements of the contracting offices that reside within the OAO organization.  The ordering period of the IDIQ is 12 months with an established ordering ceiling of $2,560,070.82.
