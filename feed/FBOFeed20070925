<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement to extend by four months the services provided under contract NNM04AA02C, “Unified NASA Information Technology Services (UNITeS)”.  Under this contract, the contractor is responsible for providing all effort necessary to support MSFC Information Services, Integrated Enterprise Management Program (IEMP) Integration Services, and Agencywide Information Services. NASA/MSFC intends to negotiate only with the incumbent contractor, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) of San Diego, California, for the four month extension. NASA/MSFC plans to acquire follow-on services that will commence on May 1, 2009, through full and open competition under separate procurement(s). The four month extension to the existing UNITeS contract with SAIC is necessary based on the following:      1.  In conjunction with the Agency Chief Information Officer’s (CIO) requirement to define the strategic role of Information Technology (IT) for NASA, an Agency IT Strategic Plan is being prepared that will encompass IT governance, enterprise architecture, knowledge management, and security of Agency information assets and knowledge.	It is anticipated that this plan will serve to formulate an Agency-wide policy regarding these areas and could significantly impact pending IT acquisition requirements, particularly those including Agency-wide and Integrated Enterprise Program responsibilities.       2.	As part of the development of an Agency-wide IT strategic plan, decisions regarding certain elements of the current UNITeS Performance Work Statement (PWS) will be required related specifically to whether or not these elements will be a part of the recompetition or will be included in other Agency-wide contract vehicles.       3.	Based on the requirement for key decisions to be made that will impact the recompetition schedule, it is necessary to extend the current UNITeS contract by four months through April 30, 2009.	This extension will serve to allow sufficient time for assessment of the impact of these decisions on the recompetition, including preparation of initial acquisition documentation and other necessary actions required to complete the recompetition.	Development and release of competitive acquisition documentation, prior to key scope decisions, could require duplication of significant resources on the part of both the Government and industry once the decisions have been made.  Therefore, extension of the current contract by four months to allow for incorporation of these key scope decisions into the development of the recompetition strategy represents the only practical alternative. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the four month extension effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 9, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this four month extension procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this four month extension procurement on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "22".

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) is upgrading the NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) for improved operations.  The existing wind profilers are vertical looking radars, the deployment of which commenced in approximately 1990.  The existing wind profilers operate continuously and provide upper air wind data which the NWS uses in a variety of ways.  In upgrading the NPN, the NWS expects to improve the resolution of wind phenomena in time and space (horizontal and vertical) and accuracy; enhance end-to-end observing system availability, access, archive, quality assurance, and timeliness monitoring; and to make use of the real-time wind profiles as an integrating sensor for a seamless system of systems.  Solicitation DG133W-07-RP-0005 will be issued on or about November 3, 2006 and will close on or about February 2, 2007.  This solicitation will encompass a development phase culminating in the delivery, installation, and testing of a first article wind profiler, followed by a production phase involving delivery and installation of up to 54 wind profilers.  [It is expected that all installations will take place within the United States.]  Additionally, the production phase will provide for initial sparing and initial maintenance of the wind profilers (until the wind profilers are transitioned to Government maintenance).  Both the development and production phases will include provisions for associated services, such as training, and associated supplies, including documentation.  The solicitation will allow for either the upgrade of the existing wind profilers or the replacement of the existing wind profilers.  The solicitation will be structured to allow for up to two awards for the development phase, with a down-select to one contractor for the production phase; however, the Government will not be obliged to make two awards for the development phase.  The Government expects that completion of the work called for by the solicitation will take place within five years after award.  All responsible sources may respond to Solicitation DG133W-07-RP-0005 by submitting a proposal which shall be considered by NOAA.  See Notes 12 and 26.

<DESC>Expression of Interest for Nuclear Reactors to Irradiate MOX Fuel

Shaw AREVA MOX Services, LLC (MOX Services) operating under a Department of Energy Contract is the prime contractor for the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) Project under construction at the Savannah River Site outside Aiken, South Carolina.  Under the terms and conditions of our prime contract, MOX Services is responsible for the procurement of the services of commercial light water reactors to irradiate MOX fuel in support of the MOX Project.  

MOX Services is seeking an expression of interest from US utilities to identify additional domestic commercial reactors to irradiate the MOX fuel produced by the MFFF from weapons grade plutonium.  The MFFF started construction August 1, 2007 and is expected to produce batch quantities of MOX fuel beginning in the fall of 2018. Duke Energy?s McGuire Nuclear Station and Catawba Nuclear Station are under contract to irradiate the MOX fuel.  It is expected that an additional forty fuel assemblies per year will be available above what those four reactors can utilize.  MOX Services is seeking additional reactor(s) to use that fuel.  The fuel supply contract would be for approximately fifteen years.

Four MOX Lead Test Assemblies are currently in Catawba Unit 1 in their second cycle of irradiation.  An extensive post irradiation program is planned at the end of each fuel cycle and removal of fuel rods and hot cell destructive examinations are planned after both the second and third cycles of irradiation.  These fuel assemblies are essentially identical to the AREVA Advanced Mark-BW 17x17 fuel operating in several pressurized water reactors except for the MOX fuel pellets and a slight increase in fuel rod length.  MOX Services is most interested in nuclear reactors that can use this fuel design; however, other commercial domestic reactors may be proposed and considered.
Additional information and background is provided in the enclosed Statement of Work.

We emphasize that the Statement of Work is provided for information only, to help your company determine its level of interest.   We are requesting your company provide a response of your level of interest with regard to this program. If you are interested in the program please request a copy of the Draft Request for Proposal from Mr. Rick Salem at rasalem@moxproject.com. 

We desire to have your expression of interest by October 12, 2007. 

This expression of interest does not establish any commitment or obligation on the part of MOX Services to acquire services from your company nor does it obligate your company either to provide services or to submit a proposal.

We extend our appreciation for any interest you may have with this very important project.  If you have any questions regarding letter, please contact me on 803-819-5057.

NOTE: (1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard. (2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee’s clearance status may suffice depending on the employee’s status within the JPAS database. (3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued.

Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that person’s citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery). Material Shipments: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to the Material Division (phone: 757-396-3141 and fax: 757-396-1029).

The additional documentation can be a birth certificate, passport or other official military documentation of United States citizenship. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated. If the person for whom the vendor/contractor is requesting a badge is a naturalized United States citizen, that person SHALL BRING THEIR ORIGINAL NATURALIZATION papers with them to the pass office in addition to the aforementioned company letter. Once presented, it will be entered in the database and be available for future use so this step will not be required to be repeated.

<DESC>The Surveillance Research Program within the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, plans to negotiate with the CHEROKEE NATION, Tahlequah, Oklahoma, for a contract, for a two-year period plus three one-year options, to continue capacity building for a cancer registry for the American Indians residing in the 14-county Cherokee Nation Tribal Jurisdictional Service Area (TJSA) who are eligible for health care through Tribal or Indian Health Service (IHS)-operated health care facilities.  Currently the number of eligible users is approximately 100,000. The ultimate goal of the project is the establishment of a population-based cancer registry, to be called the Cherokee Nation Cancer Registry, that will meet the standards of the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program in case finding, patient follow-up, data processing, data reporting, and quality assurance by July 31, 2012.  At that time the contract may be extended to maintain the registry at SEER standards.  The information to be collected will assist in measuring the burden of cancer among American Indian populations of the United States.  With the data, NCI anticipates improving its estimates for cancer rates among this group.  It is expected that the Cherokee Nation shall share costs for the establishment of the registry and assist in the development of agreements with the hospitals, clinics, pathology laboratories and other entities where data on American Indian cancer cases can be obtained.  The statutory authority for the noncompetitive acquisition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Numbered Note 22 is included and reads as follows:   The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of  FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<CONTACT>Colleen Martin colleen.martin@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>This is a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for the award of a sole source contract to the L-3 Communications Corporation.   The Electronic Systems Center of the Air Force Material Command (AFMC) intends to contract for Time and Materials efforts using the Ground Multi-band Terminal (GMT) Contract (FA8726-06-D-0001) awarded to the L-3 Communications Corporation, Hauppauge, NY under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  In this case, the USAF may deem products and/or services to be available only from the original sources in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized products or services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (see 10 U.S.C. 2304 (d)(1)(B)).  The contractor's knowledge of the GMT must include a thorough understanding of the terminal's a!  rchitecture, as a system (hardware, software and firmware), and each Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) individually.  The contractor's knowledge must also include the testing required for the terminal, how the users intend to operate the terminal, and have an established relationship with each of the GMT subcontractors and vendors.  The Air Force anticipates the issuance of this modification to the GMT contract by ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬end of 1st Quarter of FY08 to address potential future architecture and operational changes, provide additional test and certification support as well as ad hoc meetings as needed.    This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should this notice be construed as a commitment.  Any US commercial company who firmly believes that they are capable of meeting the above stated Government objectives and timeframes within this NOCA may identify their interest to the Government.  Interested firms are requested to submit a statement of qualifications, along with supporting documentation to: 653 ELSG/KCK, Attn: Ms Kathleen A. Munroe, Contracting Officer in writing or by electronic transmission to: Kathleen.munroe@hanscom.af.mil, or Ms Colleen Martin, Contract Specialist, colleen.martin@hanscom.af.mil.  Responses must be received no later than 15 days after the date of this publication and should not exceed ten (10) pages on 8½ x 11 inch paper with type no smaller than 10 pitch.  An Ombudsman, Col Russell Blaine, Director, Commander's Staff, (781) 377-5106, has been appointed !  to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal and proposal development phases of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the Contracting Officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman should be contacted only with issues or problems that have previously been brought to the attention of the program manager and/or Contractor Officer and could not be satisfactorily resolved at that level.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<b><u>Philippines Oil Spill Response Project</u></b>
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a corporate emergency response plan for major oil spills.

Petron Corporation, the Philippines's largest oil refining company, supplies one-third of the country's oil requirements and moves products mainly by sea from its refinery to 32 depots and terminals across the archipelago.  Petron is responsible for all oil and chemical spill incidents resulting from its operating sites and shipping activities both in domestic and international waters.  In an effort to strengthen and consolidate its corporate emergency response plans, Petron has requested USTDA funding support for technical assistance to develop a plan for prevention and response to oil spill emergencies at Petron's operations and in Philippine national waters.  The technical assistance will include a review of existing regulations and emergency response limitations as well as a detailed assessment of Petron's operations and facilities.  The final report will recommend how Petron can adopt corporate policies and procedures to prevent and mitigate oil and chemical spills at its operating sites and during transshipment.  The recommendations will include a master implementation schedule, details of technologies, equipment, human resource needs, training, operations and logistics requirements.    

The U.S. firm selected to provide the technical assistance will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $255,646 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.

Customs Transit Control System Project, Guatemala.  The Grantee, Superintendencia de Administraci?n Tributaria (SAT), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to Guatemala's SAT to improve its capacity to undertake customs modernization efforts.

The overall objective of the recommended Technical Assistance is to support SAT in its desire to implement improved customs transit processes and the supporting ICT systems consistent with the core elements of the World Customs Organization (WCO) Framework of Standards. 

SAT is the organization responsible for administering Guatemala's customs authority, including the customs provisions of treaties and international agreements to which Guatemala is a party.  Guatemala's customs facilities process a large volume of commercial traffic that either originates within or is directed from other Central American countries.   Additionally, Guatemala processes a significant volume of customs warehouse transfers and cargo inspections for partial or final distribution goods and value-added processes.  SAT has primary jurisdiction of the customs procedures for these transfers.  The current system has reported significant increases in the rate of international transits and returns that have not arrived at their Guatemalan or other Central American destinations.  SAT has requested this Technical Assistance to develop a more efficient and secure system that allows SAT to closely monitor this commercial activity, capture all commercial transactions, and reduce losses.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $387,500 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

Thorough knowledge of emergency procedures at this station is essential.  Errors in judgment cannot be tolerated as the welfare and livelihood of the patient may be in danger.  Must be very familiar with Chief of Staff / Ambulatory Care Disaster Plan. Security/Privacy Statement:  In the performance of official duties, the employee has regular access to printed and electronic files containing sensitive data which must be protected under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and other applicable laws, Federal Regulations, VA Statutes, policies and VHS &amp; RO policy.  The employee is responsible for protecting that data from unauthorized release, or from loss, alteration or unauthorized deletion and following applicable regulations and instructions regarding access to computerized files, or release of access codes as set forth by the Computer Access Agreement which the employee signs. Factor II:  Supervisory Controls:  The specialist is under the general supervision of the AA to the ACOS/AC; top supervision level is the ACOS/AC.  The administrative support of the FIRM is the hub of its operations.  Each member directly impacts on the other's effectiveness.  Thus each incumbent will need to be flexible to fill in an assigned area either to help alleviate a backlog or cover an absence.  Each specialist is expected to exercise judgment and shift priorities independently to accomplish the task.      Due to the unique interrelationship between 'FIRMS'/Nursing/MAS, training and/or guidance on some administrative procedures will be provider by MAS or Nursing. Factor III:  Guidelines:  The employee receives verbal and written instructions on medical administrative procedures to be initiated, researched, or changed in the necessary areas.  Some guidelines are specific, however, the employee must frequently use good judgment in dealing with unusual situations which require immediate attention.  The exercise of good judgment and management skill is important when circumstances arise for which guidelines do not exist. Guidelines exist in Title 38 U.S.C., VA Regulations, VA manuals, circulars, bulletins and Station policies.  These policies are continually changing and updates.  The employee must use proper judgment in interpreting and applying them appropriately.  Dictionaries and medical dictionaries are also available.

The employee must be able to evaluate several complex factors and adjust workload during the workday and adapt to the various situations which change priorities.  Incumbent executes technical and complex responsibility based on limited reference materials.  Must be able to make sound judgments independently.  These judgments will contribute to the success of the Information Management Program of their services and of the facility.  Incumbent is expected to utilize original problem solving techniques to address problems which may affect patient care at this Medical Center.  The area of responsibility is a complex, highly diversified area that is impacted by many disparate pressures. Flexibility is imperative depending upon administrative needs, medical needs of presenting patients, patient flow, provider needs, etc.  The employee is also required to identify and evaluate the changing requirements of the health care delivery system and make suggestions regarding the refining of methods and developing the techniques, concepts or procedures in addressing these changes. Must exercise care that all pertinent factors are considered in determining eligibility and priority for treatment, as employees decision may determine the acceptance of the applicant for care. Factor V:  Scope and Effect:  The PSA plans a vital role that affects the entire Ambulatory Care operation.  Must provide timely and coordinated appointments for patients, assist with travel arrangements, secure charts, keep clinic loads within reasonable limits, assist patients, and process clinician orders.  If the work of this position is not performed satisfactorily, the timely delivery of quality care to veteran patients is seriously affected.   Lack of skill can result in delays and disruption in patient care and a deterioration of confidence in the VA health system. The facility's resource allocation for its Ambulatory Care workload is completely dependent upon the thorough, accurate and timely input and documentation of the Ambulatory Care encounters and special services performed. The impact of the employees work contributes heavily toward the good working relationship with the clinical staff and other medical Center employees and the general public and therefore, is critical in the overall perception of the entire Medical Center and Department of Veterans Affairs. Factor VI:  Personal Contacts:  As an intricate part of the Ambulatory Care Section, the individual has contact with a wide variety of individuals such as veterans, Medical Center Management, physicians, students, other professional staff, government and VA representatives including inspection teams.  This position is the first point of contact for patients presenting for medical care.  Therefore, this position requires a poised, mature and outgoing individual with thorough and comprehensive knowledge of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Must have the ability to display the utmost tact, diplomacy and discretion.  The ability to communicate with individuals at all levels of the organization is essential. Page 4 Factor VII:  Purpose of Contacts:  Contacts are for the purpose of the coordination of patient care and supporting the Ambulatory Care clinical staff.  The proper completion of duties affects the quality and timeliness of care provided.  The purpose of contact with veterans is to assist, direct, prepare and process records, explain policies and procedures.  Employee soothes anxious veterans, patients in pain, again veterans as well as the mentally deficient patient.   Employee is in daily contact with persons who may not be cooperative, receptive and can at time be hostile and abusive.  At this point of initial contact, veterans form lasting and sometimes irreversible perceptions of what the VA is and what is can do. The scope of DHCP applications encompasses the entire Medical Center with most services relying heavily on Ambulatory Care input.  Proper and complete training of DHCP users is critical to the reliability and accuracy of the data that is input into the system. Factor VIII:  Physical Demands:  Work is partly sedimentary with a fair amount of walking, standing, bending, filing and carrying supplies and medical records, wheelchairs and wagons may be pushed and assistance may be given to patients.  Substantial use of keyboard is required. Factor IX:  Work Environment:  The work is performed in Ambulatory Care clinic settings and any of these areas are diverse and sometimes intense activity.  Employee works in close proximity of patients and may therefore, be exposed to communicable disease, and at time confronted by upset or irrational patients.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This notice serves to inform rotational molded plastic custom molders and mold makers of the intention of Rock Island Arsenal to procure molds, prototype parts and subsequent production of two major plastic parts serving to form the major parts of a trailer mounted mobile hydraulic system service and repair shop.  The lower pedestal part which mounts on a bare trailer chassis, contains tool boxes and a slideout work table with numerous mounted tools.  The second part is the enclosure top half which is  designed symmetrically so that identical parts can be joined to make a complete enclosure.  The top contains shelf areas for storing containerized supplies and equipment and mounts additional tools ready to use.  	We are seeking rotational molders and moldmakers interested in one or both of these parts. Both parts will be produced from tan colored Crosslinked High Density Polyethylene.  It is expected 1,400 half tops and 700 pedestals will be required over three ye ars.  	 	The half top is 96 long x 43.5 wide by 28 high.  The overall width of the molded double walls is 2 plus a 2 deg. internal taper. An estimated 275 inserts will join the two halves, secure the unit to pedestal and secure brackets for stowed items.  The half top double walls will have an estimated .10 to .12 inch thickness outer skin backed by an integral layer of polyethylene foam such as produced by Chroma Corp. Forma Spheres tm.      This pedestal will be molded as a single wall hollow part with portions to be cut away for three doors, and for lightening, access and clearance.  The pedestol is 96 long x 86 wide by 28 high. Wall stiffness will be enhanced by backing up the outer  shell with a layer of integral polyethylene foam such as Chroma Corporations FOAMA SPHERES tm.   Wall thickness is .25 solid plus .75 of low density foam for a total of 1.  Molding the pedestal in two parts would be considered if more economical for t ooling or production.    Estimated issue date is 28 September 2007.  NAICS Code is 326199.  This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.502 and 5.102, therefore, hard copies will not be provided.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   HUBZone Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Central Issue Warehouses (CIW) in the Northeast Region (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV) The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be David Deleranko, 817-886-1087; or by e-mail at david.m.deleranko@usace.army.mil. FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.   SCOPE OF WORK:   Central Issue Warehouse (CIW) or other similar facilities:  The primary mission of the CIWs is to provide a single point for receipt, storage, issue, exchange, and return of all authorized organizational clothing and individual equipment items at the spec ified United States Army Installation.  CIW facilities provide storage capabilities combined with office space, used in the administration of issuing soldiers equipment as needed.  The facilities support open storage for deployment functions as necessary by the Army Unit occupying the building.  The functional and operational requirements of the CIW require that the design be based on the characteristics of the material being handled and stored, the volume and flow pattern through the facility, and the inv entory pattern.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a resu lt of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   HUBZone Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for General Purpose Warehouses (GPW) in the Southeast Region (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Shelley Calderon, 817-886-1090; or by e-mail at shelley.a.calderon@usace.army.mil. FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.   SCOPE OF WORK:   General Purpose Warehouse (GPW) or other similar facilities:  GPWs will provide a building capable of meeting the Department of the Armys general purpose warehousing requirements.  The facility will be capable of supporting the storage of various equipme nt and materials, up to a Moderate-hazard level.  GPW facilities may have substantially differing design and operational requirements in order to meet the Armys needs on a worldwide basis.  The facility type will provide an acceptable relationship between  actual equipment dimensions, performance characteristics and the building dimensions.  GPWs are intended to be similar both functionally and technically to private sector industrial warehouses.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Reques t for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonst rating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performanc e capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.   In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criter ia described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Gover nment, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Govern ment will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.   The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Appr oach   Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional and Aesthetics; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Sustainability Requirements.  Volume II:  Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Past Performance on Utilization of Sm all Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.   Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 10/10/2007under solicitation number W9126G-07-R-0130.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 11/9/2007.  (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  If the Government elects to conduct a Pre-Proposal Conference, details regarding the Conference will be provided in the solicitation.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for procurement of Precise Biometrics' Biometric and Smart Card Readers on a brand name only basis. Precise Biometric 200MC Biometric and Smart Card Readers for continued use in support of the Department's PKl program.The State Department PKl program uses Precise Biometrics' Precise 200 MC hardware (smartcard and biometrics fingerprint readers). Precise certified biometric readers are part of a PKI system, which consists of Entrust software suite, SafeNet smart cards, SafeNet Cryptographic Interface Provider (CIP) middleware, and Precise readers. Interoperability of the components is essential to a functional system; components not certified by Precise may prove non-functional in this configuration. As such, there is no guarantee that other readers will support the PKIlBLADE configuration.IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires Precise 100MCreaders to be procured on a brand name only basis. Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority.Precise will only provide support for products purchased from Precise authorized resellers. If there are support issues on products not purchased through these resellers, they will defer to the supplier of the product. Safenet packages the correct, certified drivers as part of the standard CIP middleware. This is a product that the US Department of State currently has installed. Installation of different software versions may have the following issues:1. Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configurations 2. The Precise 200 MC has multiple versions firmware and thus multiple drivers. Interoperability cannot be guaranteed, nor will a single supplier support it. 3. Support for functional enhancements made to the system, as part of BLADE or future modifications cannot be guaranteed to be supported.Since Precise is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch, and replace defective readers with identical technical specification to those currently installed, Precise Biometrics is the sole source.<BR><BR>

This includes Internet Explorer 7 configured to operate on Windows XP and Vista (in Protected Mode on Vista). For the Windows XP settings, see http://csrc.nist.gov/itsec/guidance_WinXP.html and for the Windows Vista settings, see: http://csrc.nist.gov/itsec/guidance_vista.html. (b) The standard installation, operation, maintenance, update, and/or patching of software shall not alter the configuration settings from the approved FDCC configuration. The information technology should also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default ¿program files¿ directory and should be able to silently install and uninstall. (c) Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges. (d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>A) The offeror shall provide the government, with its offer submission, written verification from the GSA schedule holder that an agreement exists that validates the offeror's right to offer the GSA schedule items on behalf of the GSA schedule holder, if other than the offeror; and,  B) By proactively complying with this offer term, sellers accept that the government will make award to the GSA schedule holder only, as the sole awardee.  Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (LMIAQM), Department of State, is processing this acquisition at the request ofthe Systems Integrity Division. This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for procurement of Precise Biometrics' Biometric and Smart Card Readers on a brand name only basis. Precise Biometric 200MC Biometric and Smart Card Readers for continued use in support of the Department's PKl program.The State Department PKl program uses Precise Biometrics' Precise 200 MC hardware (smartcard and biometrics fingerprint readers). Precise certified biometric readers are part of a PKI system, which consists of Entrust software suite, SafeNet smart cards, SafeNet Cryptographic Interface Provider (CIP) middleware, and Precise readers. Interoperability of the components is essential to a functional system; components not certified by Precise may prove non-functional in this configuration. As such, there is no guarantee that other readers will support the PKIlBLADE configuration.IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires Precise 100MCreaders to be procured on a brand name only basis. Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority.Precise will only provide support for products purchased from Precise authorized resellers. If there are support issues on products not purchased through these resellers, they will defer to the supplier of the product. Safenet packages the correct, certified drivers as part of the standard CIP middleware. This is a product that the US Department of State currently has installed. Installation of different software versions may have the following issues:1. Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configurations 2. The Precise 200 MC has multiple versions firmware and thus multiple drivers. Interoperability cannot be guaranteed, nor will a single supplier support it. 3. Support for functional enhancements made to the system, as part of BLADE or future modifications cannot be guaranteed to be supported.Since Precise is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch, and replace defective readers with identical technical specification to those currently installed, Precise Biometrics is the sole source.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Modification 02: This modification is being issued to incorporate Attachment 3 to this announcement. (End of Modification) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) is upgrading the NOAA Profiler Network (NPN) for improved operations.  The existing wind profilers are vertical looking radars, the deployment of which commenced in approximately 1990.  The existing wind profilers operate continuously and provide upper air wind data which the NWS uses in a variety of ways.  In upgrading the NPN, the NWS expects to improve the resolution of wind phenomena in time and space (horizontal and vertical) and accuracy; enhance end-to-end observing system availability, access, archive, quality assurance, and timeliness monitoring; and to make use of the real-time wind profiles as an integrating sensor for a seamless system of systems.  Solicitation DG133W-07-RP-0005 will be issued on or about November 3, 2006 and will close on or about February 2, 2007.  This solicitation will encompass a development phase culminating in the delivery, installation, and testing of a first article wind profiler, followed by a production phase involving delivery and installation of up to 54 wind profilers.  [It is expected that all installations will take place within the United States.]  Additionally, the production phase will provide for initial sparing and initial maintenance of the wind profilers (until the wind profilers are transitioned to Government maintenance).  Both the development and production phases will include provisions for associated services, such as training, and associated supplies, including documentation.  The solicitation will allow for either the upgrade of the existing wind profilers or the replacement of the existing wind profilers.  The solicitation will be structured to allow for up to two awards for the development phase, with a down-select to one contractor for the production phase; however, the Government will not be obliged to make two awards for the development phase.  The Government expects that completion of the work called for by the solicitation will take place within five years after award.  All responsible sources may respond to Solicitation DG133W-07-RP-0005 by submitting a proposal which shall be considered by NOAA.  See Notes 12 and 26.

<DESC>Questions

There is a note on 3A-403, which states ?Install one new sign @ all existing doors on corridors?.

Does the government intend for the contractor to install new signs at the pair of stairwell doors and/or South Wing corridor? If so, will signs go on both sides of the door according to the detail? 

 

 See addendum #2

 

In the renovation notes: No. 23 states to ?Install new hardware after refinishing door, see specs?. With all the existing doors to be refinished on the West Wing, 1st floor the hardware specs only identify men?s (104) and women?s (108) bathrooms to install Hardware Set 6. 

Does the government intend for the contractor to replace any other hardware sets after doors are refinished on any other floor on the east and west wings? 

 

 See addendum #2

 

The hardware schedule identifies hardware sets to be installed on the following doors: 1. HW Set 2-Door 100b, 2. HW Set 6 ? Door 110 & 110a. Doors and frames at 110a and 110b is for Comm Room 110a. Should Hardware Set 2 be installed on Door 110a and 110b? 

 

 See addendum #2
. On floor plans 101, 102, and 103 (not on 104) there is plan symbol "E" at the "pair opening" leading to existing stair "work not in contract".  Are these required?  If so, additional hardware must be indicated since all other "E" symbol doors will receive a new lockset only and these pairs need fire exit devices due to their location. 

 

See addendum #2 

 

b.  Section 08710 - Finish hardware has many hardware sets with many doors numbered therein.  For the new openings at alcove and communications these doors are listed under SET 6 which is for a single opening.  The pair openings at communication require additional items and should be listed under SET 11 most likely.  All new door nos. on the plans were not found listed in the hardware sets. 

 

 See addendum #2 

 

c.  Section 10800 - Toilet accessories has many items listed, named, etc.  But the plans indicate only new toilet tissue dispensers, grab bars, and mirrors to be installed.  Are these other items required? 

 

Only the items listed above.

<DESC>The government provided Addendum No. 2 which referenced ?sheet FP 101 ? Auditorium 139C.  Remove the four pairs of exterior doors on the east and west sides. Replace with new aluminum doors ? Pair 3'-0" x 7'-0".  Match new door from 139C phase 2 (Full glass) cleaning the existing glazing, store front (inside & out) and aluminum flashing. The government has also provided specifications in the Addendum 2 for the contractor to meet these requirements.

Our subcontractor (Best Glass) has made a site visit in which he has discovered that the specifications call for a concealed closure and the Amendment 2 requires the contractor to match the existing closure units in the building. This does not meet the new Section 08120 specifications.

Please advise.
The intent is to have concealed closers.Replace the storefront / sidelight , frame along with the w/ 1" insulated glazing and the doors. 
On 3A ? 101, Enlarge Alcove Plan for ?Comm. 110a? has a conflict between the detail on 3A ? 101 and 3MH ? 401.  Please review the conflict.

	2. Room size 3A ? 101, 4'-0" x 13'-10" Vs 3MH ? 401, 4'-0" x 9'-10".

Please verify as to what detail that the contractor will construct ?Comm. 110a? by?

Please advise.

The layout on 3A-101is how the area shall be constructed.On 3MH - 402 add note to coordinate mech.w this layout and to clear stair.

<DESC>UPDATE: The RFP for this acquisition has been updated.  A summation of the amendments has been posted on the bidder's library under Bidders-OCX at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access.  

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the OCX RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

               (a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
               (b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html).  

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee.

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the OCX RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

	(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
	(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. 

A pre-proposal conference will be conducted at the ARINC conference facility-Kilroy Airport Center 2250 E. Imperial Highway, El Segundo CA 90245-with check-in starting at 8:00 a.m. and the conference beginning at 8:30 a.m. on 8 Mar 07 for the purpose of answering questions regarding this solicitation.  Offerors should refer to clause 5352.215-9001 NOTICE OF PRE-BID/PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE contained in Section L of the model contract for further guidance.

OCX, in conjunction with the modernization of the GPS Block II and the introduction of GPS Block III assures reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position and timing signals to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity, and time.  GPS is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  GPS must comply with 10 United State Code (USC)  2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensures the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes; and 42 USC  14712, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. This acquisition executes those statutory mandates.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541710 and the size standard used is 1,000 employees.

<DESC>UPDATE #4: The RFP for this acquisition has been updated.  A summation of the amendments has been posted on the bidder's library under Bidders-OCX at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access.  

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the OCX RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

               (a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
               (b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html).  

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee.

Services will require the ability to coordinate various disciplines and the differing aspects of phasing of construction involving occupied/unoccupied facilities for the purpose of providing construction documentation.  Services will require the preparation of supporting engineering documentation, including but not limited to field investigations reports, calculations, cost estimates, energy and economic analyses.  Services may include incidental architectural, mechanical, civil, fire protection, and structural work.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to state the Government?s intent to increase personnel on the bridge requirement to support an increase in annual training quotas.  The increase in number of personnel will also be incorporated into the competitive solicitation, number H92239-07-R-0006.  All other terms and conditions in the bridge contract will remain unchanged.  Inquiries shall be directed to Ms. Umetria Thomas, Contract Specialist at thomasu@soc.mil or 910-432-6145.  Due to the potential for non-receipt of e-mail responses, it is the contractor's responsibility to ensure e-mail requests have been received. END AMENDMENT INFORMATION.

This is a notice of intent to negotiate a firm fixed price six month bridge contract with Global Services Corp, 245 Westlake Road, Fayetteville, NC 28314.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Global Services Corp under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?.  The US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) currently has a contract for the provision of Medical Instructors and Support Services for Special Operations Forces (SOF) Medical Courses offered by the Joint Special Operations Medical Training Center (JSOMTC), US Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School under contract number USZA92-02-C-0004.  The contract is due to expire on August 31, 2007.  However, due to delays in the acquisition process, a six month bridge contract will be awarded to allow time to conduct a competitive acquisition and a new contract can be awarded.  The anticipated release date for the competitive solicitation is 17 September 2007.  The period of performance for the bridge contract is 01 September 2007 through 29 February 2008 and the primary place of performance is Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  

The requirement is for medical instructors, as well as a wide variety of services to support the classroom instruction and facility.  Examples of the instructor support include advanced medical instructors, paramedic instructors, and veterinarians.  The support services include logistics, engineering (IT/AV), and personnel/administrative functions.  Examples of the support required in the administrative and logistical areas are: development/implementation of training, development of training aids, and the life-cycle support of the military training systems including the installed audio-visual, communications, and information technology systems as well as their supporting electrical, electronic, and electro-mechanical equipment.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed effort on a full and open competition basis is solely the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for consideration under the upcoming competitive procurement.  On March 21, 2007, the contracting office issued a sources sought notice to determine interest in the new solicitation (announcement number SSUT0702-JSOMTC).  Based on the responses to the sources sought notice, the Government made the determination to proceed with the new requirement on a competitive basis as a small business set-aside.  Please see pre-solicitation announcement number H92239-07-R-0006, issued on June 18, 2007, for additional information.  Inquiries shall be directed to Ms. Umetria Thomas, Contract Specialist at thomasu@soc.mil or 910-432-6145.  Due to the potential for non-receipt of e-mail responses, it is the contractor's responsibility to ensure e-mail requests have been received.

Response - When a task is awarded, the proposed candidate must have the ability to obtain a Secret Clearance if required for that particular task. Question 11.  (1)  Does the Government envision all SOW tasks being implemented immediately upon contract award, or on an as required basis during the period of performance? Response - On an as required basis. 		(2)  Can the Government identify those tasks that must be staffed immediately upon contract award? Response â€“ No, see above. Question 12.   Other than the sample task, must the offeror identify specific persons to perform each SOW task? Response -  No, however the offeror needs to identify a specific person for each of the labor categories identified in paragraph M.3.1.1. Question 13.    RFP paragraph 3.1.4. requires conference and show support, and states "These shows require an on-site representative who will plan . . . etc." Does "on-site" refer to a full-time person on-site at Picatinny? Response -  No, the person will be expected to be on-site at the location of the conference/show. Question 14.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) in the Southwest Region (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX) The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Jan Slick, 817-886-1050; or by e-mail at errette.j.slick@usace.army.mil. FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presenc e Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to sup port ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardi zation (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has be en assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.   SCOPE OF WORK:   Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.

Additional facility and functional support amenities shall be provided as outlined in the project Scope of Work.  The varying components for t his facility will be: building occupancy requirements, regional soils and climatic conditions, facility structural considerations, HVAC systems, and the exterior architectural features.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary a s required to meet project specific requirements.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task order s at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.

<DESC>EXPRESSION OF INTEREST â€“ TO MANAGE AND OPERATE THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST NATIONAL LABORATORY The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Oak Ridge Office (ORO) is seeking an Expression of Interest from prospective contractors, who may be interested in competing on a full and open basis, to manage and operate the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).  PNNL is a DOE Office of Science multi-program Laboratory whose mission is to deliver science-based solutions for the nationâ€™s energy, environmental, and security needs. This Request for Information is not a Request for Proposals.  This announcement is part of market research and anticipated responses are sought to identify sources that have the comprehensive knowledge, skills, and capability to meet the overall requirements to provide the intellectual leadership and management expertise necessary and appropriate to manage, operate, and staff the Laboratory; to accomplish the research mission and roles assigned by DOE to the Laboratory; and to perform the work described in the Statement of Work (to be issued in a draft Request for Proposals).  The DOE is currently preparing its draft solicitation (Draft Request for Proposals). The PNNL contract is anticipated to be a performance-based, cost-plus-award-fee, management and operating (M&O) contract type.  The PNNL will continue to be a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  The majority of the work effort is currently being performed in the Richland/Tri-Cities area of the State of Washington, and DOE anticipates that it will continue to be performed there.  The current contract with the incumbent expires on September 30, 2007; however, DOE has announced that it will extend the current contract, for up to two years, to allow for the competition process. The PNNL mission focuses on biological, chemical, computational, environmental and materials sciences; technologies to detect and mitigate weapons of mass destruction and counter acts of terrorism; and technologies for energy and environmental security.  The Laboratory has six core competencies: 1. Microbial and cellular biology and applied proteomics; 2. Environmental sciences in biogeochemistry; physics and atmospheric sciences; climate, and subsurface science; and integrated assessment of energy and environmental impacts; 3.

<DESC>Background:  The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California, is seeking to identify sources for continuing Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) support for the MCSW Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT) program. TSAT is a protected global network communications system which includes a geostationary satellite constellation, management of overall system and network operations, and wideband connectivity to the Defense Information System Network (DISN) core in coordination with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA).  The TSAT system includes the Space Segment, the TSAT mission operations system (TMOS) Segment and the Terminals Segment. 
 
MCSW has an incumbent SE&I contractor to assist the TSAT Program Office in the integration of the diverse system activities which ends in September 2008.  This Sources Sought inquiry pertains to the follow-on to this effort.  Work under the follow-on contract will commence in 2008 and continue for approximately 10 years of the TSAT program through Initial Operational Capability (IOC), transition, and sustainment.  Launch of the first TSAT satellite is planned for FY2016; IOC is planned for FY2018.  

Program Objectives:  SE&I tasks are shared by the Government Program Office, FFRDCs, the SE&I Contractor, and the Segment Contractors.  SE&I tasks includes leading the coordination, guidance and execution of end-to-end systems engineering and integration activities at the systems level across all inter-Segment and external interfaces for system test and verification, system deployment, operations, and sustainment. It also includes oversight and insight of systems engineering and integration within system Segments as required to ensure system performance is met.  It is expected that the SE&I contractor must be capable of working intimately with Space, TMOS, and terminal segments, as well as external stakeholders? (DISA, NSA) government and contractor teams.  However, the SE&I contractor must also have the capability to act independently and objectively for the benefit of maintaining TSAT cost, schedule and performance.   As a point of departure, this SE&I effort will be based upon the TSAT?s control and reference documents already developed as part of the incumbent SE&I contract.

Responsibilities:
Government SPO, FFRDCs and Segments.  The TSAT Government Program Office is the final decision authority for all program matters and exclusively provides direction to contractors.  The Government Program Office chairs key program boards and working groups which bring together the participating contractors and stakeholder agencies for program coordination and execution.  The Aerospace Corporation and MITRE Corporation serve as the Trusted Agent of the Government Program Office and provides ongoing oversight of all systems engineering and integration processes and activities

SE&I Contractor.   The SE&I Contractor shall establish, maintain, and control the authoritative and authenticated technical and programmatic baselines including inputs from the Segments and external agencies. They shall establish, manage and lead the systems integration and testing effort, to include identifying and resolving system level issues with government cognizance.  They shall administer major program-level control boards such as the Engineering Review Board (ERB), the Risk Management Board (RMB), and the Configuration Control Board (CCB).  They shall operate and maintain the authoritative control and reference documentation and program-unique data information system, data bases and libraries.

It addresses the functional areas of Detect, Assess, an d Defend for the 2012-2024 timeframe and spans across many threat types, to include surface to air missiles; directed energy; indirect fires; direct fires; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) agents; and electronic / information threats.   The objective of the FSA is to identify possible material and non-material solutions to solve or mitigate the identified protection shortfalls.  These shortfalls are grouped into 16 categories listed below.  1. Limited capability to sense, detect and track explosives (including concealed explosive materiel and human carried IEDs). 2. Limited capability to detect, then predict enemy actions / hostile intent prior to hostile actions. 3. Limited capability for mobile forces to detect and determine destination of indirect fires, ballistic missiles, and aircraft. 4. Limited capability to detect and track through the entire flight path all indirect fires from fixed and semi-fixed locations. 5. Limited capability to detect and track CBRN agents at least 2 km from sensor. 6. Limited capability to automatically integrate and interpret relevant information to provide timely situational understanding. 7. Limited capability to defeat indirect fires, ballistic missiles, and aircraft through accurate and precise active measures. 8. Limited capability to defend against directed energy weapons. 9. Limited capability to detect and track submerged and subterranean activity down to 100 feet below the surface. 10. No ability to detect or defeat surface to air missiles with ground-based resources. 11. Limited capability to detect and track direct fire at least 2 km from a static location. 12. Limited capability to detect and no capability to defend against laser and RF energy sources. 13. Limited capability to manage and assess defensive resources (resource management tools). 14. Limited capability for active / passive defense measures to withstand multiple, simultaneous hostile fire attacks or changes in the operational environment. 15. Limited capability to detect electronic warfare and information threats. 16. Limited capability to reconfigure sensor capabilities, reposition sensors remotely, or connect sensors to another family of sensors to meet changes in the operational environment for: 	a. fixed / semi-fixed sites 	b. mobile forces c. SCOPE.  The IUBIP FSA is an attempt to provide a protection capability that will produce 360° hemispherical, as well as subsurface, protection against hostile threats.  The study focuses on the Joint Force and its applications in a Joint environment.  T he study uses Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) compliant scenarios and vignettes to provide the operational setting for the analysis of the submitted approaches.  Some of the analysis may be required at the Secret level. 3. SUPPORTING DATA.  All IUBIP documents are classified FOUO and not available for posting on the web.  However, the points of contact listed in paragraph 7 will answer questions at any time from industry. (Please send questions via email.) 4. INSTRUCTIONS.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Federal Investigative Services Division (FISD) intends to renew a sole source agreement to obtain education record information throughout the nation with National Student Clearinghouse (NSC).  When OPM field agents are unable to obtain education record information at the actual college/university, they are referred to the NSC to obtain the records.  NSC is the nation's consolidated source for student degree, diploma, and enrollment verification.  They maintain an electronic registry containing more than 75 million student records; more than 2,800 colleges enrolling 91% of U.S. college students currently partner with NSC.  OPM deems it appropriate to award a fixed-price agreement on other than a full and open competitive basis to NSC.  NSC is the available responsible source and no other source will satisfy the needs of the Agency.  The North American Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 611710 - Educational Support Services.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  FURTHERMORE, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  This is not a solicitation for offers, but rather a notice of OPM's intent to negotiate a sole source award to NSC.  This notice is for information only, and may represent the only official notice.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Bankruptcy Record Checks
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Federal Investigative Services Division (FISD) intends to renew a sole source agreement to obtain bankruptcy record information with Pacer Service Center.  Pacer is a service of the United States Judiciary, run by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and is available days, nights, and weekends.  Pacer provides electronic access via the web for case and docket information from the Federal Appellate, District and Bankruptcy courts, and from the U.S. Party/Case Index.  Almost 19 million cases are available, linked by most all courts in the U.S., and are updated daily.  In addition to bankruptcy information, searches can be conducted to determine whether or not a person/party is involved in federal litigation.  Pacer bankruptcy searches provide a listing of all parties and participants including judges, attorneys, and trustees; a compilation of case-related information such as cause of action, nature of suit and dollar demand; a chronology of case events entered in the case record; appellate court opinions; judgments or case status; and types of documents filed (ex. schedule of creditors).  Pacer has been verified and approved within OPM for use in investigative products.  Pacer is being considered because other commercial vendors only provide a portion of the bankruptcy file.  Most vendors do not provide a copy of the Schedule, listing all creditors.  Sending Special Agents to each individual court across the country to conduct record reviews is not practical or a good business practice.  This service is also an integral part in supporting the goals of the National Intelligence Directive (NID) with regard to the Personnel Security Investigative mission.  OPM deems it appropriate to award a fixed-price agreement on other than a full and open competitive basis to Pacer Service Center.  Pacer Service Center is the available responsible source and no other source will satisfy the needs of the Agency.  The North American Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for action is 922110 - Courts.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of the Government's Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement
<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award to DataAspects Corporation, 143 Orchard Oak Circle, Campbell, CA on a sole source basis, for the design and development of software applications for the maintenance, storage, and ret rieval of chemical and biological information from a complex, multi-tiered systems invented (Patent No. 6,654,736) and operated by the Department of Chemical Information at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.  The system is large and sophisticated,  containing integrated information on over 500,000 chemical compounds and their testing results in numerous in-vitro and in-vivo biological assays.  Many skills are required of those engaged in the creation and maintenance of this system including chemistr y, parasitology, biological testing, chemical inventory management, and information technology.  Two to three years are required to attain a proficiency in these areas sufficient to contribute independently to the systems growth.  The contractor is a trai ned parasitologist with over twenty years experience in biological testing.  The contractor was instrumental in the conversion of this very system from index-sequential to relational-  and thesaurus- oriented databases.  The contractor was the principal in vestigator for five years of the systems development from 1990 through 1994.  The contractor has the requisite skills to begin working immediately with no loss of time in learning the divers functions of the system and their interactions.  Any other contr actor would take at least a year of intensive training to reach the current contractors level of proficiency.  This is for the continuation of a current ongoing research project.  Competing this requirement and awarding to any other source would result in  substantial delays and disruption of a project already in progress and would also increase the overall cost to the Government.  There is no solicitation number, for reference use PR Number W74MYF7243N021-024.  This procurement shall be under other than fu ll and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for a competitive quote.  Any response to this notice must be su bmitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Governments requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government.  If no written responses ar e received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  See Note 22.  The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is:  craig.e.anderson@amedd.army.mil.

C.) Evaluation Factors

M.1   General
a. The Government is conducting this source selection in accordance with the competitive negotiation source selection procedures contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), part 15.

b. In accordance with FAR 52.215 1 (f), the Government intends to award contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals represent the best value.  Per FAR Part 2, best value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The Government will conduct the best value analysis using the factors listed in Section M.3.  In performing its best value analysis, the Government will compare any relevant differences among the evaluated proposals to determine which proposal offers the overall best value.  This effort will include comparing the strengths, weaknesses and risks associated with each offer.  

c. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contracts without discussions with offerors except clarifications if necessary as described in FAR 15.306(a) and will evaluate each offer on the basis of the offeror's initial proposal. Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors' best terms from a technical and price standpoint.

d. When conducting the evaluation, the Government may use data included by offerors in their proposals, as well as data obtained from other sources.  Each offeror is responsible for ensuring that the information provided is thorough, accurate, and complete.  

M.2   Basis for Award
The Government will make an award to the offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the best overall value based on the pass/fail criterion and evaluation factors listed in M.3.

FSA has established a Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) to evaluate proposals submitted for this acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated by the TEB members in accordance with the procedures contained in FAR part 15, and the Evaluation Factors hereinafter described.

Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each offeror?s proposal in accordance with the pass/fail criterion and evaluation factors listed in M.3.  In determining the best value to the government after all Pass/Fail criterion are passed, the Cost and Privacy& Security are significantly more important than the Solution & Past Performance.  The price evaluation will not be point scored.  If all Pass/Fail criterion are passed then the proposal will be then considered, scored and evaluated against the evaluation factors in M.3.   
M.3   52.212-2 Evaluation ? Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

a.)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government, pass/fail criterion and other factors considered. 

All of the Pass/Fail Criterion must be passed in order to be considered for further evaluation and consideration. 

The following factors will be used to evaluate offers in accordance with the following rating schedules after all Pass/Fail Criterion have been met.

i. Privacy and Security (400 pts) - The Government will evaluate the offeror?s privacy and security capabilities which will ensure 100% Government confidentiality for electronic, printed and distributed documents.  The Government will evaluate the offeror?s network security and all security measures that are available in order to ensure information is not taken out of the facility. 

The Offeror who successfully describes and addresses all areas of security and privacy which meets the Government?s requirements that are realistic, relevant and complete, will receive a higher score than offerors who fail to do so.  

ii. Solution and Past Performance (200 pts) - The Government will evaluate the quality 
control plan which should address how, in partnership with the government, the offeror will manage and mitigate project risk and project scope.  The Government will evaluate the efficiency of the process which will be most efficient to completing the required turn around times for both the Form 1099 and Disbursement Transaction Statements.  

The Government will evaluate the ease of use and content of the activity tracker and reporting systems that will be utilized to display pertinent information requested by the Government.  

The Government will evaluate past performance based on phone calls to past customers which demonstrates their capability and capacity to deliver high quality service and solutions.  The past performance evaluation will examine the Offeror?s actual performance on at least two (2) efforts.  This review will focus on the size, scope and complexity of the efforts, relevance and outcome.

The assessment of the Offeror?s past performance will be used as one means of evaluating the credibility of the Offeror?s proposal and the relative capability of the Offeror.  A record of marginal or unacceptable past performance may be considered an indication that the ability of the Offeror to perform the contract as proposed may be questionable.  An Offeror with an exceptional record of past performance will receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is only acceptable.
iii. Price ? The Government will evaluate price from lowest to highest.  The lowest price will have a more favorable evaluation then a higher price. 
*Technical and past performance,when combined, are more important than price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION

DFAS has invested a considerable amount of time and money into the design, and subsequent purchase of the listed equipment in order to meet the storage requirements necessary to stay in compliance with DoD directives.  NETTAPP, ADIC Storage system with VERITAS software were first installed at DFAS in 2005.  Total acquisition costs for these storage systems since 2005 is over $9,000,000.00.  The Governments requirement is for technical support of storage products, as required to comply with warranty provisions of the hardware and software. Maintenance representatives must be authorized by NETTAPP in order to service the equipment currently under warranty without violating the terms of the warranty.

Consequently, this acquisition is for the renewal of software/hardware maintenance previously purchased, implemented, and currently being used by all DFAS users, is considered to be a logical follow-on in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)2 (ii).

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-9131), 1900 Half Street S.W. JR11-0203, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 372-3692 Fax: (202) 475-3904.

Evaluation of Quality:

By quality, the Government means how well the offeror conformed to specifications and to standards of good workmanship. Evaluation of quality will be a subjective assessment. It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable quality.  This is a matter of judgment.  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address especially unfavorable reports of quality, and the offeror??s response, or lack thereof, will be taken into consideration.

Quality will be rated on an adjectival scale.  The Government??s conclusions about the overall quality will be a factor in determining the relative merits of the offeror??s proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered the most advantageous to the Government. The Government wants displays that look professional and make an impression.

Evaluation of Delivery Timeframe:

The total amount of time for completion of this contract will be evaluated, with a shorter timeframe preferred. Timeframes will not be ranked, but will be used in conjunction with the other factors to determine the proposal which represents the best value to the Government.

Evaluation of Price:

The offered price will be used in conjunction with the other factors to determine the proposal which represents the best value to the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Statement of Work Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers DCIP Area Development Plan Training Class  INTRODUCTION The Office of the Chief of Engineers through the Commander, U.S. Army Cor ps of Engineers has the responsibility for providing master planning support to Army installations to the include the development and management of installation Real Property Master Plans (RPMP).  These responsibilities also include providing assistance to  the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) and the Installation Management Activity (IMA), which includes its Headquarters Staff, Regions, and Installations. Further, as per DoD 3020. ff, the Army Corps of Engineers is the DoD Critic al Infrastructure Protection (DCIP) lead for the Public Works Sector.  The DCIP role involves imbedding a Infrastructure assurance planning process throughout DoD (including the Army)    One of the prime responsibilities is sustaining/ establishing both DC IP Public Works and the Armys Master Planning Curriculum and Course of Instruction. To facilitate the successful accomplishment of this task, the Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires that a new course be established to provide instructions on how to complete an Area Development Plan that considers Infrastructure Assurance considerations into the planning process.  BACKGROUND Army Installation Commanders are responsible for the short and long range planning of their installations, including real  property, in support of current and future missions.   Installation Real Property Master Plans satisfy a multitude of requirements.  To assist Installation Commanders, Headquarters, Department of the Army developed policy guidance for development of insta llation master planning.  Army Regulation 210-20 requires each installation to develop a Real Property Master Plan.  The RPMP is the Installation Commanders plan for the management and development of the real property assets of the installation, including  land, facilities, and infrastructure.  Additionally, the RPMP documents the real property planning process.  The RPMP is comprised of the following components: Real Property Master Planning Digest (RPMPD); Long-Range Component (LRC); Installation Design G uide (IDG); Capital Investment Strategy (CIS); and the Short Range Component (SRC). The Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for developing and maintaining the Master Planning Curriculum and Course of Instruction and teaching master plann ing techniques to Army installations.  This forum includes teaching master planning state of the art training to installation planning professionals at such venues as the Installation Management Institute, and sponsoring 40 hour training classes related to  master planning.  IAW with updated 210-20, Critical Infrastructure Assurance considerations and Mixed Used Development factors are now required to be included in the comprehensive development of installations, however, and many installation planners are n ot trained to consider these constraints.  Further, the installation Planning components have not been updated to address these factors.   An Area Development Plan is a focused succinct planning product that allows for a concise planning analysis that is comprehensive but allows the minimum planning needed to make adequate planning decisions.  ADPs are used extensively by cities and towns to  master plan neighborhoods as well as consider special initiatives (i.e. historical preservation, bicycle use, etc.).   It is the intent for Army installations to use ADPs as a means immediately evaluate DCIP and mixed used development impacts on installa tion planning decisi ons.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK  Develop and conduct ADP training awareness that will provide instructions to planner on how to complete an Area Development Plan, This awareness would include development of awareness material.  TASKS  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will contract for the procurement of a complete Area Development Plan awareness package.

The use of brand name description is esential to the Government's requireemtns, for Departmenet of State infrastructure connectivity requireemtns, tehreby precluding consideration fo teh products of anotehr company. Use of such software which has not been tested by teh Deparmtne nore been proven in field use may result in software compatibility conficts, increase teh complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of IT consolidation requirements. IRM has identified the software listed as a key component of teh Department's IT consolidation. Software listed above is required to provide teh automation and integration of Information Technology Infrastructure Libraray (ITIL) best practice processes for IT service management. The software listed is designed with hightly integrated modules to support each of teh ITIL Processes and Functions. THe integration provides a substantial increased capability for operational efficiency and significant decrease in maintenance erquirements due to common core functions and reuse of common code in related modultes. Department of State already own licenses for the Core Module and two Supporting Modules. BMC is te sole provider for modules that integrate into the existing BMC Remedy system that the Departmetn of State is currently using. Use of other software which has not been tested byt the department for compatibility with the existing BMC Remedy system will cuase unacceptable delays to the IT consolidation.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contratctors unique qualifications are cited as teh basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be teh only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key componenet of the Department's IT consolidation.  Additionaly, the use of a brand name description is essential to the Governement's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.<BR><BR>

C.) Evaluation Factors

M.1   General
a. The Government is conducting this source selection in accordance with the competitive negotiation source selection procedures contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), part 15.

b. In accordance with FAR 52.215 1 (f), the Government intends to award contracts to the responsible offerors whose proposals represent the best value.  Per FAR Part 2, best value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The Government will conduct the best value analysis using the factors listed in Section M.3.  In performing its best value analysis, the Government will compare any relevant differences among the evaluated proposals to determine which proposal offers the overall best value.  This effort will include comparing the strengths, weaknesses and risks associated with each offer.  

c. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contracts without discussions with offerors except clarifications if necessary as described in FAR 15.306(a) and will evaluate each offer on the basis of the offeror's initial proposal. Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors' best terms from a technical and price standpoint.

d. When conducting the evaluation, the Government may use data included by offerors in their proposals, as well as data obtained from other sources.  Each offeror is responsible for ensuring that the information provided is thorough, accurate, and complete.  

M.2   Basis for Award
The Government will make an award to the offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the best overall value based on the pass/fail criterion and evaluation factors listed in M.3.

FSA has established a Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) to evaluate proposals submitted for this acquisition.  Proposals will be evaluated by the TEB members in accordance with the procedures contained in FAR part 15, and the Evaluation Factors hereinafter described.

Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each offeror?s proposal in accordance with the pass/fail criterion and evaluation factors listed in M.3.  In determining the best value to the government after all Pass/Fail criterion are passed, the Cost and Privacy& Security are significantly more important than the Solution & Past Performance.  The price evaluation will not be point scored.  If all Pass/Fail criterion are passed then the proposal will be then considered, scored and evaluated against the evaluation factors in M.3.   
M.3   52.212-2 Evaluation ? Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

a.)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government, pass/fail criterion and other factors considered. 

All of the Pass/Fail Criterion must be passed in order to be considered for further evaluation and consideration. 

The following factors will be used to evaluate offers in accordance with the following rating schedules after all Pass/Fail Criterion have been met.

i. Privacy and Security (400 pts) - The Government will evaluate the offeror?s privacy and security capabilities which will ensure 100% Government confidentiality for electronic, printed and distributed documents.  The Government will evaluate the offeror?s network security and all security measures that are available in order to ensure information is not taken out of the facility. 

The Offeror who successfully describes and addresses all areas of security and privacy which meets the Government?s requirements that are realistic, relevant and complete, will receive a higher score than offerors who fail to do so.  

ii. Solution and Past Performance (200 pts) - The Government will evaluate the quality 
control plan which should address how, in partnership with the government, the offeror will manage and mitigate project risk and project scope.  The Government will evaluate the efficiency of the process which will be most efficient to completing the required turn around times for both the Form 1099 and Disbursement Transaction Statements.  

The Government will evaluate the ease of use and content of the activity tracker and reporting systems that will be utilized to display pertinent information requested by the Government.  

The Government will evaluate past performance based on phone calls to past customers which demonstrates their capability and capacity to deliver high quality service and solutions.  The past performance evaluation will examine the Offeror?s actual performance on at least two (2) efforts.  This review will focus on the size, scope and complexity of the efforts, relevance and outcome.

The assessment of the Offeror?s past performance will be used as one means of evaluating the credibility of the Offeror?s proposal and the relative capability of the Offeror.  A record of marginal or unacceptable past performance may be considered an indication that the ability of the Offeror to perform the contract as proposed may be questionable.  An Offeror with an exceptional record of past performance will receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is only acceptable.
iii. Price ? The Government will evaluate price from lowest to highest.  The lowest price will have a more favorable evaluation then a higher price. 
*Technical and past performance,when combined, are more important than price.

Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
M.4 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990)

Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

 A.5 HSAR 3052.209-70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006)
 
   (a) Prohibitions.
 
     Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
 
   (b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
 
     Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
 
     Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
 
     Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)--
 
     (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
 
     (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held--
 
        (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
 
        (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
 
     (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
 
       Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
 
   (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
 
     (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
 
        (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
 
        (ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
 
     (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4- year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
 
     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
 
   (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

<DESC>NLRB01-07-R-0004	VIDEO SERVICE

Amended to post Vendor questions(s) and Agency answer(s)as related to the solicitation.

Question  1.  How Do I look up your special clauses, rules and regs pertaining to the request for video services.


Answer: The clauses and provisions can be retrieved at www.acquisition.gov.  Click on Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) under Quicklinks located on the far right side of the page.  That will take you to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  Select either the HTML Format button, or the PDF Format button to open up the document.  I recommend using the HTML.  When the page opens, it will be the General Structure and Subparts page.  Scroll down to the end of the page and there you will see Subchapter H ? Clauses and Forms.  Click on Part 52 ? Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses and you will be able to view the clauses associated with the notice.

 

Question 2.  Is the NLRB currently doing video services between your different field offices and if so, are you only looking for an offeror to provide the transport (IP, T1, etc) and bridge to connect all the field units simultaneously.

Answer: Yes, we currently do I/P video calls between different Polycom video units. We need that capability (to call from point A to point B without going through a bridge), plus the capability to do bridged calls (with 3 or more parties on one call).

 
Question 3.  What are the allowable charges under the RFP.  For example, space, utilities, labor costs, etc.

Answer: We are only looking for MONTHLY costs to transport video calls, and to do video bridging.

 
Question 4.  Do you want the offeror to be centrally located to your field offices or can the offeror be located anywhere in the US

Answer: Anywhere in the US.

 
Question 5.  Is there a ceiling to the costs of the video services you are requesting.

Answer: The Agency cannot provide you with cost factors pertaining to the notice.  This is information that you should provide to the Government for consideration during evaluation of the proposal.

 
Question 6.  Your notice asks for a technical plan and a cost plan.  Are these two documents to be combined into one package and sent via email.
 

Answer: Yes, the proposal should consist of a Technical Proposal and a Cost Proposal.  If sending the document via e-mail is a problem, it can be send via express mail, as long as it is received by the proposal due date and time cited in the notice.

 
Question 7.  Can I call you back directly if I need further clarification.  

 
Answer: It is preferred that you address all of your concerns/questions via e-mail so that your question(s) can be properly addressed.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the original solicitation number PR128881. This purpose of this amendment to amend the original solicitation by: 1) providing changes to Items B and C; 2) providing responses to questions asked by potential offerors; and 3) to extend the due date and time of the solicitation. All other original information remains unchanged. Item B shall now read: B) MFR/Part# Nortel 5510-48T Switch at 1 each. Item C shall now read: C) RESERVED. The following are questions submitted by potential offerors along with the Government's responses: --- Start Questions and Responses --- Question 1: "(We) need more info on the AMX System. Can we get type of complete system configuration i.e. Equipment ID, Model No., etc., and what is it controlling, i.e. other devices?" Response 1: The AMX panel connects to an AMX Axcent2 controller, which is connected to a 4YDM Autopatch switcher. There are extron interface boxes that connect each workstation into the switcher, but they don't have anything to do with the AMX. There is also an AMX amplifier in the system to control the volume for the overhead speakers. Upgrade to the system should support: Six (6) CFE 40? LCD wall mounted displays. The matrix switcher requires upgrade of three (3) output cards for RGB and two (2) cards for horizontal and vertical sync, four (4) inputs to expand existing 28x4 matrix switcher to 32x8. The video system should be capable of displaying the following sources: (24) Computer Interfaces (Graphics), (4) CFE Camera Feeds (Composite Video), (1) CFE VHS VCR (Composite Video), (2) Cable TV Tuners (Composite Video), (1) Quad Video Processor (Graphics Signal Fed from 4 Video Inputs). New four (4) in-ceiling speakers. One (1) wired touch panel with a upgraded 10" color screen and should provide control for all displays and inputs All equipment should be rack mountable. Question 2: "Issue: The configuration information does not specify a processor speed. Question: Does the government have a requirement for the processor speed or will you accept the lowest speed of - Dual Core Intel Xeon Processor 5110 (1.60GHz, 4MB L2,1066)?" Also, "The description [of the processor of the Dell Workstations-690] is incomplete and does not indicate one." Response 2: The minimum processor speed acceptable is 5130 (2.00Ghz 4MB L2, 1333). Question 3: "Issue: The requirement for "Intel Hyper-Threading: Hyper-Threading feature preset to ON. Can be disabled/enabled in BIOS. HYPER - [460-7163]" creates a compatibility issue within the Dell configuration tool. The Intel Hyper-Threading NOTE states: Hyper-Threading is available with the 5000 Sequence processors only and may increase the performance of some applications. This feature is ONLY supported in Windows XP and can be enabled or disabled in the system BIOS at any time. We have sent the question to Dell to determine that since we have selected a 5110 series processor and the compatibility error remains on the screen; does this in fact create a compatibility issue or is there an error in the configuration tool. Question: If we do not hear back from Dell in a timely fashion: since this configuration can be enabled or disabled in the system BIOS at any time and there is no cost associated with this setting; Will the government consider a proposal without this setting enabled?" Response 3: This is not an issue if it capable of being enabled or disabled at anytime. Question 4: "Will you accept a Price Quote for part of this solicitation? In particular a Price Quote for: B) MFR/Part# Nortel AL2001E15 Network Business Policy Switch 2000 at 1 each; and C) MFR/Part# Nortel AL2033005 450 SX1-port 1000 Base-SX Single PHY MDA at 1 each." Response 4: Acceptable offers must provide all the requested products and services. The Government will only issue one award from this solicitation. Offerors should note that they should not submit a price for Item C because it is now RESERVED. --- End Questions and Responses --- Responses to this solicitation are now due by no later than Thursday, 27 September 2007 at 1000 hours Eastern Daylight Savings Time. Offerors shall state in their proposal that they acknowledge receipt of Amendment 1.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:     
30,000 Disknet Pro Licenses, including Encryption Policy Manager, Annual Support and Maintenance.
This acquisition is a brand name only requirement based upon the excerpt from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and Approval.

Reflex Disknet Pro software was installed on the USSOCOM enterprise in January 2007, and provides USSOCOM Headquarters enterprise and local visibility of compliance with established network security policy. This requirement is to continue the maintenance and support of the system.  As the system is currently less than a year into service the costs associated with the purchase as outlined below would not be fully recouped if any competitor's software were able to be integrated as a replacement.   
Reflex Disknet Pro reveals how security policy is actually applied on the operational network. By highlighting systems and users that do not comply, command attention and resources may then be focused on strengthening the network security posture through better policy enforcement. Reflex Disknet Pro also provides information that will identify issues that are inadequately addressed by existing policy. This information enables USSOCOM to continually develop and refine its computer network security policy. Finally, due to its ability to monitor removable media at a highly granular level, Reflex Disknet Pro is a useful tool to mitigate the risk necessitated by operational requirements. The software is the only CJCSI 6510.01D approved software which allows USSOCOM to meet the following requirements:
	Provide an  enterprise-wide solution with a policy driven mechanism of securing information
	Provide an automated capability to ensure data integrity across the enterprise
	Provide a  central control of access to removable media, as well as user access to floppy disk, CD/DVD ROM, Zip/Jazz drives, memory sticks, PDA and flash memory allowing all removable media/IO devices to be authorized before use is granted and for authorization to be centrally managed or authorized with Active Directory group management
	Provide a profile based file management capability to prevent users from creating defined file types on local workstation and or network drives
	Provide device management through administrative control of user access to all PC ports.
	Provide ability to control USB, IrDA, Com, Firewire and LPT ports 
	Provide detailed auditing capability. All events are centrally logged in an SQL database with the ability to create structured queries and detailed reports. All file operations on all removable storage devices including CDs/DVDs, thumb drives and PDAs, can be audited. 
	Provide tracking of user behavior and system security
	Automatically detects and integrate with compatible anti-virus scanners
	Ensure data can only be accessed by authorized personnel, on authorized systems
	Provide enterprise and local visibility of compliance with established network security policy (show how security policy is actually applied on the operational network) 
	Provide the automated capability to identify issues not captured by existing policy
	Provide capability to mitigate the risk necessitated by operational requirements
	Provide an automated application verification and  audit analysis capability 
	Provide visibility into enterprise operations and potential security threats
	Quantifies the status of enterprise security providing the necessary information for continuous improvements
	Provide a capability to build security analysis into existing policy and automate event response
	Provide capability to identify and prioritize potential network vulnerabilities
	Provide a common policy definition for network operation among enterprise stakeholders  
	Ensure only approved file types can be accessed on removable drives.
	Ensure only authorized digitally tagged disk can be used when using floppy disk, or during removable media authorization; enforcing a complete virus check of all removable media.

United States Special Operations Command requires this brand name only support as award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The approximate cost of the duplication effort would be $899,497.00, as outlined in the table below.  These costs are based on expenditures under the current contract that have been incurred to gain a level of operational acceptance by the government for contractors and government employees.  

The cost that would not be recovered through open competition involves resources for testing and operational readiness (certification and accreditation, operational compatibility and continuity) with the current network architecture and the risk associated to downtime and lack of coverage during a replacement phase of new technology.   

Award will be made to the quotation which offers the best value to the government.  The Government also reserves the right to make no award at all.

ECP SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFB:  
The desired outcome of this system is to provide 24hr surveillance to the North and West Entry Control Points (ECPs).  The system must monitor incoming/outgoing traffic utilizing high resolution cameras with motion sensors to identify make, model, color, and license plate identification of approaching vehicles.  System must be capable of being controlled from a central location. Both ECPs must have a minimum of one pan/tilt/zoom camera.  There are two points at each gate where surveillance needs to occur; the guard shacks and at the fence-lines where the gate is located.

Proposals should reflect the appropriate amount of equipment to provide for the following capabilities.

THE NORTH ENTRY CONTROL POINT (ECP):
At the fence-line, the ECP needs appropriate surveillance equipment to identify license plates, makes, and models of approaching vehicles day or night.  The guard shack needs to have equipment capable of monitoring inbound and outbound traffic.  Specifically, individual drivers need to be identified for two lanes of inbound traffic.

Limitations:
The fence-line where the gate is located is approximately 150 yards from the guard shack.  A power source is available at the gate, but the closest conduit is approximately 50 feet from the fence-line.  Fiber optic cable and conduit will need to be run to the existing conduit where the fiber optic cable can then be fed to Building 15, Pass and ID, for connection to the base data network for the camera feeds.

Options:
Any digging and installation of conduits for running fiber optic cable from the cameras to the existing conduit should be quoted separately as an option.

THE WEST ENTRY CONTROL POINT (ECP):
The guard shack needs to have a system capable of monitoring inbound and outbound traffic.  Specifically, individual drivers need to be identified for one lane of inbound traffic and for the commercial vehicle entrapment area located 100 feet south of the guard shack.

Limitations:
Fiber optic cable and conduit will need to be run to the existing conduit where the fiber optic cable can then fed from the conduit approximately 700 yards to Building 780, SALF, for connection to the base data network.

Options:
The surveillance equipment to identify license plates, makes, and models of approaching vehicles day or night at the fence-line where the gate is located needs to be quoted separately as an option.  This needs to include running the fiber optic cable from the cameras to the conduit and providing power to the cameras from the closest power source 40 feet from the fence-line.  The closest conduit is approximately 400 yards from the gate.   The fence-line where the gate is located is approximately 400 yards from the guard shack.  

SYSTEM MONITORING:
Once connected to the base data network at Building 15, Pass and ID, and Building 780, SALF, the camera feeds should be fed to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) located in the Secondary Alarm Monitor (SAM) site in Building 300.  The SAM will be the primary monitoring location for the entire required surveillance system and provide security controllers the capability to change viewing direction of Pan/Tilt/Zoom (PTZ) cameras at each ECP.  Host equipment located in the SAM needs to be stand-alone and incorporate information from the DVR that is fed information over the base data network.  DVRs must have motion sensing recording features with looping capabilities and accompanying equipment able to capture and print images.

FUNDS ARE NOT PRESENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURCHASE ORDER.  The Government?s obligation under any contract as a result of this synopsis/solicitation is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>Contractor Questions and Answers Round 1:

Question 1: I see no reference to the FAR 'Buy American' requirement.  Is this out?

Answer 1: Please consult the FAR references mentioned in the solicitation, which discuss (in FAR Part 25), the origin issue.  The Buy American Act does not apply to this acquisition; instead the Trade Agreements apply.  The FAR may be found on the Internet at:
http://acquisition.gov/far/index.html

Question 2: On all items where Air Conditioning is optional, do you want the unit quoted without A/C as the base, and then have the optional A/C listed as an extra cost?

Answer 2: This is acceptable.  You can show the cost without A/C, and then indicate how much extra it would cost to include A/C.

Question 3: If we are right you need some kind of vehicles and you need that they include taxes that we have here in our country?  Also, you need that we provide you warranties?

Answer 3: Generally, for vehicles imported into Ecuador (as oppose to locally purchased vehicles), the Embassy is not able to obtain either a waiver or reimbursement from the Ecuadorian government for local Value Added Taxes (VAT) and Customs Duties.  Currently, VAT is 12% and the Customs Duty for imported vehicles is 10%.  It is up to each company participating in this procurement to research what taxes and/or duties are applicable for the vehicles proposed by the company, and any applicable taxes or duties must be included in the quotation.

Question 4: In solicitation Section 2.0 (Pricing), it states the following: "The Contractor shall provide the vehicles listed below at firm-fixed price(s).  Provide quotation showing unit price and total maximum price, including all features listed below, priced in U.S. dollars.  The above price(s) is in terms of "Cost, Insurance and Freight" (CIF), with final delivery to be made in Quito, Ecuador.  The vehicles shall be insured by the Contractor until such time as the vehicles are received by NAS in Quito.  The Embassy will clear and title the vehicles."

In addition to the request CIF destination, it is our understanding that we would also need to provide proper insurance coverage in country (Ecuador) until such time as the vehicles or motorcycles are actually physically delivered to NAS in Quito? 

Answer 4: The vehicles and motorcycles must be delivered to customs in Ecuador.  The Embassy will go to customs to clear the vehicles/motorcycles.  Clearing the vehicles/motorcycles at customs will constitute acceptance, and the Embassy will then be responsible for taking the items from customs to their final destination.

Question 5: In solicitation Section 3.0 (Payment), it states the following: "The Contractor may invoice after completion of delivery (partial deliveries allowed)."

Is it possible to respond offering alternative payment terms?  That is, which may be considered as an alternative to proposed payment terms following actual delivery as outlined herein?

Answer 5: Payment will be made only after delivery.  In the case of a partial delivery, you may only invoice for the number of vehicles or motorcycles delivered.

Question 6: In Solicitation Section 6.0 (Evaluation of Quotations), it states that the Government may make one award or multiple awards, whichever is most advantageous to the Government.

With specific regard to motorcycles only, is it our understanding that more than one dealer may be awarded this same bid/contract?

Answer 6: Due to the number of different items required, it is understood that some companies may only be able to quote on one or a limited number of the different line items.  For this reason, multiple awards may be necessary.  However, it is unlikely that any single line item (such as the motorcycles) will be split in to multiple awards, unless multiple awards are necessary to obtain the desired quantity.

Questions 7: The NAICS code for Line Item 0007 is 336991; size standard 500 employees.  Is it correct that this NAICS code relates to supplier businesses which employ <500 employees?

Answer 7: Some NAICS codes are based on company revenue, while others are based on the number of employees.  For the NAICS code you referenced, a company operating under that NAICS code would be considered a small business if the company has 500 or fewer employees.  Keep in mind, though, that this acquisition is not set aside for only small businesses.  This acquisition is unrestricted, which means that both small and large businesses may participate.

Question 8: Regarding the seating capacity for the bus, it says: "25 to 30 passengers capacity (including or not driver)."  Does this mean "not including driver"?

Answer 8: You are correct.  The capacity should be 25 to 30 passengers, not including the driver.

Question 9: As a former General Manager at an automobile dealership I have negotiated fleet purchases and arranged shipping to foreign countries.  This type of negotiation would be similar with the addition of the arrangements for warranty.  That being said, must there also be a dealership for the brands of each vehicle type, and must they have a service department?

Answer 9: One of the requirements in solicitation Section 1.0 is that the vehicle(s) quoted must be capable of being maintained commercially in Ecuador and must be covered by the manufacturer's warranties.  In Section 6.0 (Evaluation of Quotations), there are several items listed under Factor 2 that the quoted vehicle(s) are required to meet, and each quoter must submit appropriate technical documentation and other relevant documentation to show that the quoted vehicle(s) meet these requirements.  Two of the requirements under Factor 2 are that the vehicle is capable of being maintained commercially in Ecuador, and that the vehicle is cost-effective to operate and maintain.  It is up to each quoter to determine how to show that the vehicle(s) quoted meet these requirements.

Question 10: My next question is country of origin for the manufacturers.  I assume you would prefer an American branded product for the automobiles and light trucks.  However, for the larger trucks this may be more difficult.  As for the motorcycles, Harley Davidson is the only American contractor for motor cycles I am aware of and Harleys are considerably more expensive than a comparable Japanese brand.  I suppose the key question would be; is buy American more important than the bottom line price?

Answer 10: Due to the unique requirement for the vehicles and motorcycles, which is to support anti-narcotics missions and surveillance, what is more important is that the vehicles quoted are consistent with those commonly seen on the roads in Ecuador.  This, as well as the points explained in #9 above, will be important factors in determining whether the quoted vehicles will meet the mission needs.  (Also, see question #1 above.)

Question 11: Regarding the Cargo Truck (Item 4.4):

a.  For Tires (4.4.13), what is meant by "Ring 15 to Ring 18"?

b.  For Cargo Area (4.4.14): What body configuration is desired?  Flatbed, with or without removable stake sides/ends, or removable solid sides?  Steel front bulkhead, with or without mesh screen window opening?  Tarp?  Van Body?  Dump Body?  etc?

Answer 11:

a.  Tires: from ring 15 to ring 18.  That?s the size of the tire.  For example, in a truck that has this specification:  7.5-16-14PR or 235/70R16.  This means a ring 16 inches inside diameter tire.

b.  Cargo area and body configuration:

In Ecuador it is called ?chasis cabinado? ? that means chassis and cabin.  They usually sell this kind of body configuration and then we will construct a wagon to be mounted on the chassis.

Question 12: For the Mid-Size Bus (Item 4.5), do you really want (auxiliary) floor mats and locks on all doors (reference 4.5.19)?

Answer 12:

Floor mats are not necessary.

Locks on all doors: driver?s door ? yes, right door ? the mechanism usually locks the door.

In Ecuador, a mid-size bus normally has 2 doors, 1 for the driver on the left side, and 1 for the passengers on the right side.  A key lock on the drivers door usually comes as a standard feature, and for the right door, there are usually 2 kinds of mechanisms to open and close the door, a manual with tie rods, and a pneumatic.  Either manual or pneumatic work, and normally the door is locked by the mechanism.

Q1.  You are requesting solid core cushion tires but have provided sizes for pneumatic tires can you clarify what you are looking for?

A1.  The pneumatic numbers are currently on the vehicles and need to be replaced with solid core cushion tires.  We are requesting solid core cushion tires with rims which we define as a solid rubber tire with no air in it.  We don't want solid hard rubber tires.  The cushion tires must give some semblance of a decent ride over hard ground.  

Q2.  Confirm that the Government requires solid core tires for the Polaris Ranger and CAT 924.G?

A2.  We need solid core cushion tires as reflected in answer 1 above.

No other changes are authorized.

The closing date remains unchanged.
