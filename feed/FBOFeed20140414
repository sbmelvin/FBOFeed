<DESC><strong>Introduction <br /><br /></strong>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation has been charged by the DHHS with developing products for the mitigation and/or treatment of radiation injuries resulting from a nuclear and radiological attacks to the stage where products are eligible for advanced product development by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) or acquisition under the Project BioShield Act of 2004. <br /><strong><br />Description <br /></strong><br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to solicit proposals for contracts entitled "Development of Medical Countermeasures to Mitigate and/or Treat Radiation-Induced Lung Injury after a Radiological/Nuclear Incident " to advance the development of candidate medical countermeasures (MCMs) to reduce mortality and/or major morbidities (e.g. pneumonitis, fibrosis) associated with exposure of the lungs to radiation from a radiological or nuclear incident. NIAID anticipates that research and development studies supported by this BAA will advance candidate MCMs toward eventual FDA approval or licensure to mitigate/treat radiation-induced pulmonary injury and thereby improve survival. For this Broad Agency Announcement, it is anticipated that candidate MCMs will enter the evaluation and development pathway at various stages, from early research to post marketing (for drugs or biologics that are already licensed or approved for other indications), so the offeror is expected to provide a Statement of Work based on the stage of the candidate and the work that needs to be performed to advance the MCM. <br /><br />The proposals will be evaluated on the extant, underlying data supporting the amelioration of radiation-induced lung damage and reduction of mortality and/or major morbidities (e.g. pneumonitis, fibrosis) by the compound proposed for study, and the comprehensiveness, soundness, adequacy and suitability of the proposed scientific approach and methodology used to support the advancement of the candidate MCM for the mitigation or treatment of the Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure (DEARE) towards FDA approval or licensure under the FDA Animal Rule. The evaluation will also be based on the adequacy of the scientific and technical personnel, facilities, equipment, (Good Laboratory Practice [GLP], etc.) and project management. Approaches proposed for study should already have positive efficacy data in an animal model, which demonstrates improved survival or a reduction in major morbidity when the compound is administered 24 hours or later after radiation exposure. Proposals will be evaluated based on the following technical evaluation criteria: (1) Technical Plan, (2) Scientific and Technical Personnel, (3) Project Management, and (4) Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources.<br /><br />It is anticipated that 2-4 cost reimbursement; completion type contracts will be awarded for a 3-year period of performance beginning on or about 06/01/2015. <br /><br />The NIAID estimates that the annual total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) will be $1-2 million per contract award per year; however, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s). The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. The period of performance proposed by an offeror should not exceed 3 years. <br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the Agency. This BAA will be available electronically on/about 04/29/2014, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.<br /><br />For this solicitation, the NIAID requires proposals to be submitted via two methods:<br />(1) Disc (CD or DVD) and (2) Online via the NIAID electronic Contract Proposal Submission (eCPS) website. The content of the disc and online proposals must be identical. Submission of proposals by facsimile or e-mail is not acceptable. <br /><br />For directions on using eCPS, go to the website https://ecps.niaid.nih.gov and then click on "How to Submit."

The anticipated delivery order will define the Government's requirement for Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) which is necessary for transitioning and redesigning the gimbal into TSS production. <br /><br />As the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the TSS, Lockheed Martin, is the only source that currently possesses sufficient requisite knowledge, engineering expertise, aircraft integration information, and technical data required to perform these efforts. No other source has the technical qualification and necessary resources to perform the work described herein, nor will any other supplies or services satisfy the Government's requirements.<br /><br />This synopsis is published for informative purposes (THIS NOTICE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS). Interested parties may identify their interest and capability by responding to this notice. The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the

  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The College of Distance Education (CDE), Naval War College, has a requirement to conduct two (2) nonresident evening courses in Theater Security Decision Making as part of the Fleet Seminar Program in the following areas:  Annapolis, MD and Washington, DC.

The courses are essentially the same as taught in residence at Newport, with the CDE resident faculty preparing the course syllabus, procuring teaching materials, and funding administrative expenses.
Because the site of the courses is removed from the Naval War College (NWC) it is necessary to contract individuals who reside in these areas to serve as an instructor and local administrator for the courses.
 The qualifications for this position are unique in that they require a combination of professional education, naval warfare operational experience, a familiarity with Naval War College missions and functions, and competence in teaching at the graduate level, using the NWC methodology.

The following Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities specific to each course apply:

Ph.D. in International Relations; National Security Affairs 
Joint Professional Military Education Phase 1 
Prior military experience at rank of 05 or above 
Graduate of a Senior Service College

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 01 August 2014 - 12 June 2015

PROCEDURES FOR SOLICITATION/AWARD

A written Request for Quotation (RFQ) #N00124-14-T-0291 (Form SF 1449) will be issued in 1-5 business days after this Notice posting.
 Interested parties may obtain a copy of this SF 1449 from the FedBizOpps or NECO website or by contacting Ginny Reedenauer at ginny.reedenauer@usnwc.edu.

The award date is estimated to be no later than May 30, 2014

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a solicitation set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) for Invitation for Bid (IFB) for Barnes Building Roof Repairs in Boston, MA. The NAICS code for this procurement is 238160. The estimated construction cost is between $100,000 and $500,000.00. The project is planned to be issued on or about April 2014.   <br>  <br> The building is a 58,000 square foot, 10-story office building in a dense urban area exposed to coastal storms and high winds. The existing roofing system is a fully adhered Ethylene-Propylene-Diene-Monomer (EPDM) system which has been damaged during recent storm events, including Hurricane Sandy. Damages include partial separation of the EPDM from insulation substrates, partial separation of the EPDM from the perimeter parapet wall, water penetration below the EPDM into insulation layers, and other damages and general age deterioration. High wind events have caused the EPDM to balloon over large areas of the roof, worsening existing deterioration, and threatening to completely separate the EPDM from substrate material, creating a potential hazard in adjacent areas.  <br>  <br>  Specific work tasks are intended to reconstruct severely deteriorated areas of the roof and to secure the remaining existing EPDM and substrate materials in place. These tasks include: full depth roof repair (new insulation and EPDM) in limited areas (approximately 1250 SF), reattachment of the EPDM to the perimeter parapet wall, caulking, and installing a sandbag ballast and wrap and tie system at selected locations on the roof.  <br>  <br> The logistics are a consideration for this project since it is located in the city of Boston. Traffic control and pedestrian traffic control will be necessary, with the possibility of shutdown of the street. The building has limited access for large equipment on multiple sides of the building. The building is adjacent with another large high-rise building which is separated by a narrow alley. The building and adjacent parking lots will be occupied during the construction contract. A staging area adjacent to the building will be made available to the Contractor.  <br>  <br> This is not a request for proposals at this time. The solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about April, 2014. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted. The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at douglas.r.raney@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>The Sacramento District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has an upcoming acquisition to establish contracts to construct cutoff walls using the jet grout method along the waterside slope of the levee in Sacramento, California.   <br>  <br> Site R3A is located on the right bank of the American River at the Capitol City Freeway Bridge. The gap in the cutoff wall extends approximately 325 feet.  The Capitol City Freeway crosses the levee in the north-south direction through the middle of the gap. Using jet grouting, the soil cement cutoff walls will be extended toward the Capitol City Freeway but not completely across the Freeway. The cutoff wall would be installed to within 10 feet of the edge of both sides of Capitol City Freeway, with approximately 88 feet on the upstream side of the freeway and approximately 83 feet on the downstream side. Extending the cutoff wall from the existing limits to within 10 feet of the edge of pavement would capture seepage in this area. <br>  <br> Site L10 is located on the left/south bank of the American River at Howe Avenue. A 200-foot window at the site is proposed to be closed with approximately 345 linear feet of cutoff wall using the jet grout method along the waterside slope of the levee.  The proposed cutoff walls will begin 15 feet before the end of the existing slurry cutoff wall, running parallel and adjacent to the existing walls for 25 feet.  It will then turn at an angle and run down the waterside slope of the levees, then turn and continue parallel to and offset from the levee crown.  It will turn at an angle to run up the waterside slope to the levee crown of the levee, and then turn and continue for an additional 24 feet parallel and adjacent to the existing slurry cutoff wall.  After the jet grout cutoff wall is installed, a blanket of low permeability material will be placed on the waterside slope of the levee.  The blanket will begin 10 feet beyond the cutoff wall centerline, and extend up the slope.  Finally, the existing riprap slope protection will be removed and replaced after construction on the waterside slope under the bridges to prevent erosion. In addition, an approximately 175-foot section of the existing levee upstream of Howe Avenue will be raised by approximately 1 foot to provide required flood protection.   <br>  <br> The Contractor shall use a jet grouting system for constructing cutoff walls at both sites.  The Contractor shall also be able to jet grout around existing utilities, to be protected in place. <br>  <br> Acquisition Information: <br>  <br> This acquisition is proceeding as a Request for Proposals (RFP) using the Trade-off Method.  This RFP is a Competitive, Unrestricted Full and Open Competition and all businesses may respond.   <br>  <br> Estimated Cost Range is between $1,000,000   $5,000,000 <br>  <br> Period of Performance for Construction:  120 Days. <br>  <br> This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: Z2PZ, SIC CODE: 1629, NAICS Code: 238110.  The size standard for this code is $14,000,000.

<p>Sources Sought Synopsis: FA8251-14-R-Voltage Control Oscillator</p>
<p>Classification Code: 59</p>
<p>1. NOTICE</p>
<p>1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if future efforts can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 336413, which has a corresponding size standard of 1,000 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for future procurements. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>1.2 This notice is a Sources Sought, and is not a request for competitive proposals, quotations or an invitation for bid. Since this Sources Sought does not represent a current requirement, response is voluntary and the Government assumes no liability to reimburse contractors for either the effort or the associated costs to respond, or for any information provided. These costs remain solely the responsibility of the responding contractor. Information provided will be used solely for planning and market research purposes in determining the competitive atmosphere for these assets.</p>
<p>2. SCOPE</p>
<p>2.1 The 416 SCMS/GUMAD has a valid requirement and is seeking contractors who have skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully build the Printed Wiring Board (PWB). If a contract is awarded, it is anticipated to be a one-time buy.</p>
<p>2.2 The PWB is part of the Interface Test Adapter (ITA) for the Modular Low Power Radio Frequency test equipment in the AN/APG-68 Radar for the F-16 weapon system.</p>
<p>2.3 Prequalification is required prior to being considered for contract award. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control authority in order to maintain the quality of the part. The approved sources retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, and technical data that are not economically available to the government, and the data and knowledge are essential to maintaining the quality of the part. 12604339 is a Northrop Grumman Selected Item Drawing (SID). A potential new source must go to OEM to qualify for this part and be placed on the SID as an approved supplier by the OEM. Estimated likely costs to the potential offeror to become qualified by OEM: $250,000. Please reference the attached Source Qualification Statement (SQS) for more information regarding qualification requirements and procedures. <br />3. NAME OF KNOWN SOURCE<br />Lockheed Martin</p>
<p>4. DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>4.1 This Sources Sought does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished and responding to this request in no manner guarantees a contract will be awarded to the respondent. The information provided is to the best of the Government's knowledge of plans, desires, and general situation as it exists at the time of the Sources Sought. This potential requirement is in the planning phase and, therefore, all information is potentially subject to change.</p>

<a href="mailto:rory.g.thelen.civ@mail.mil">ACC - Warren (ACC-WRN)(DTA)</a>
<DESC> <br> 1.	Purpose: This document is a Request for Information (RFI), which covers information being requested by the Government regarding various aspects of light-weight structures technology. <br>  <br> 2.	Participation in this RFI does not represent or create any contractual obligation by the Government.  The U.S. Government is not soliciting samples, nor is the Government under any obligation to issue a solicitation or award a contract to any individual or manufacturer because of this RFI.  Vendor participation is entirely voluntary and by participating, each Vendor agrees that its participation does not create any rights for the Vendor to submit any claims, monetary or otherwise, against the Government.  <br>  <br> 3.	The data supplied by Vendors in response to this RFI will be used for internal Government purposes only, and will not be disclosed to any outside third parties.  By Federal Law, Government employees are bound by criminal statute not to disclose contractor proprietary information, which the Government has requested, and therefore, separate non-disclosure agreements between Vendors responding to this RFI and the Government are neither appropriate nor necessary.  <br>  <br> 4.	Background:  The Lightweight structures team is tasked with developing light-weight items for a Ground Combat Vehicle.  The tasks involve looking at a myriad of ways that we may be able to bring light-weighting to the vehicle system.  This is to include every aspect of the vehicle from the structure itself to the various components that make up the vehicle system such as: <br>  <br>  	The automotive systems (power train, mobility, and suspension systems) <br>  	Protection systems (armor, blast, and active protection systems) <br>  	Auxiliary systems (Seat, floor, doors, hatches, etc.) <br>  <br> This RFI is broad-ranging in technology and application. <br>  <br> 5.	The Lightweight Structures team is inquiring into available materials, technologies, and approaches to developing lightweight structures for Combat Vehicle applications.  Please bear in mind the general requirements the military faces: low annual production volume, vehicle weight in excess of 40 tons, off road durability, etc.   <br>  <br> a.	The vehicle hull.  The potential of light-weighting the vehicle hull structure is extremely desirable.  The Government is looking into all facets of hull design, configuration, materials, and integration methods.   <br>  <br>  	The Government is interested in a variety of configurational approaches including (but not limited to) space frame and monocoque, some hybrid of those approaches, or a novel hull structure.  The vehicle structure configuration can greatly influence the weight of the overall system. <br>  	The Government is interested in novel material advances that improve the specific strength and moduli over conventional metal designs.  Materials that can reduce the weight, volume, and/or burden of the structure are of interest. <br>  	The Government is interested in forming and joining technologies.  Technologies must increase the joint efficiency and the load transfer of the structural members without impairing the strength of the structural material.  For example, drilled holes in structural members often decrease the strength of those members. <br>  	The Government is interested in technologies that will improve the vehicle hull's modularity, adaptability, and repair times, due to our constantly changing battlefield dynamics. <br>  	The Government is interested in coatings and other technologies that will improve corrosion resistance, as well as enable dissimilar material joining.   <br>  <br> b.	Vehicle components. <br>  <br>  	The Government is interested in exploring light-weighting technologies as they are applied to vehicle components and subsystems.  Technological innovation may include, but would not be limited to, materials substitution, component redesign for more efficient weight-savings construction, vehicle system and subsystem redesign to allow for removal of redundant components, and similar weight saving efforts.   <br>  <br> c.	Weight analysis and tracking <br>  <br>  	The Government is interested in keeping accurate accounting of the weight of components and of the overall vehicle.  Methods and best-practices are being sought for efficient tracking of the weight of the vehicle or its components or subcomponents.  The Government is interested in prior examples and lessons learned from light-weighting efforts, and specifically how advances in weight savings were tracked and recorded.   <br>  	The Government is interested in methods for tracking primary and secondary weight savings achieved from technological advancements.  For example, a lighter and more efficient engine would show primary weight savings through a direct reduction in vehicle weight, and a secondary weight savings by reducing the amount of fuel that the vehicle must carry as a result of increased fuel efficiency.  Methods and best practices are sought for identification of primary and secondary weight savings, as well as for efficient tracking of overall vehicle, component, and subcomponent primary and secondary weight savings.  <br>   <br> d.	Industry trends. <br>  <br>  	The Government is interested in gaining opinions from industry observers regarding how light-weighting trends will affect various industry segments, particularly automotive segments, over the next 5 to 10 years.  What are the overall trends in the light- weighting arena?  Much ado is always made of composite materials being used for light weighting, but traditional materials such as steel, aluminum and magnesium have much to contribute as well.  The Government would be interested in gaining insight into general industry trends driven by, or affected by, light-weighting.  All responses should be backed by data where the source is referenced.  The Government would also be interested in any specific areas such as: <br> i.	What are the current trends in carbon fiber research and production?  What trends do you see in lowering cost, and increasing product strength over the next 5 to 10 years?  Do you see any major manufacturing trends?  Do you see the use and production of carbon fibers increasing or decreasing, and why?  Do you see the use of Carbon fibers in military applications changing?  In what ways do you see those changes? <br> ii.	What are the current trends in Glass fiber Research and Production?  What trends do you see in lowering cost, and increasing product Strength over the next 5 to 10 years?  Do you see any major manufacturing trends?  Do you see the use and production of Glass fibers increasing or decreasing, and why?  Do you see the use of Glass fibers in military applications changing?  In what ways do you see those changes? <br> iii.	What are the current trends in alternative fiber Research and Production?  What trends do you see in lowering cost, and increasing product Strength over the next 5 to 10 years?  Do you see any major manufacturing trends?  Do you see the use and production of Carbon fibers increasing or decreasing, and why?  What type of fibers offer the most promise for military applications? <br> iv.	What are the current Research trends in Thermoplastic Resins?  Thermoplastic resin can offer some desirable advantages in resin use especially in re-use and recycling.  What type of future do you see for low-to-medium level production of systems using these materials?  What type of materials will show future promise for military applications? <br> v.	What are the current Research trends in Thermoset Resins?  Thermoset resins have long been used in military applications.  What type of future do you see for low-to-medium level production of systems using these materials?  What type of materials will show future promise for military applications? <br> vi.	What are the current Research trends in Aluminum materials?  Many advances have been made in Aluminum alloys that have long been used in military applications.  What type of future do you see for military systems using these materials?  What type of materials will show future promise for military applications? <br> vii.	What are the current Research trends in Steel materials?  Many advances have been made in Steel alloys that have long been used in military applications.  What type of future do you see for military systems using these materials?  What type of materials will show future promise for military applications? <br> viii.	What are the current Research trends in other metals?  There has been a push to explore new alternative metals for various uses in vehicle systems.  What type of future do you see for military systems using these materials?  What type of materials will show future promise for military applications? <br>  <br> 6.	Evaluation:   The Information that is received will be analyzed on several factors. <br>  <br>  	Application:  The technology should be able to be applied to a specific component or system.  It is acceptable that some technologies will have a broader application potential.  However, the information responding to this RFI should detail at least one application and a path for implementation for a specific application. <br>  	Readiness:  It is not required that the technology be advanced to any certain readiness level.  However, the ability to implement a technology in the near future is most desirable.  This could apply to technologies that are not currently at a high readiness but do have a development plan currently in place to achieve a  quote mark more ready quote mark  state in the near future. <br>  	Producibility:  The ability to produce the product at a level that is appropriate to an Army vehicle production schedule (~200-2000 vehicles per year for new vehicles), and at a reasonable cost are needed.  Demonstrating that production level/costs can be achieved at some point is needed for consideration.  Technology/products that can achieve this now, or within the next five years will be more desirable. <br>  	Affordability:  Costs will need to be addressed.  While low-cost is certainly a desired trait for any technology, it is not a limiting factor.  Technologies that can provide well-documented costs, production levels, and what the scale-ups are for each will also be well received. <br>  	Performance:  It is important that each technology document, to the extent possible, its performance.  Where applicable, the technology should be compared to a current baseline.  This RFI is meant to be data-driven.  When evaluating what technologies seem feasible and usable, data and evidence provided with each response will be a critical factor. <br>  	Industry trends:   These trends will be analyzed separately.  Several factors will be taken into consideration when analyzing the trends: <br> -	Industry standing of the individual.  Individuals that have experience and/or education 	pertaining to the topic will be given more weight in the analysis. <br> -	Trends that are quantifiable will carry more weight over qualitative opinions <br> -	The use of referenced and verifiable data will increase the weight of the opinions. <br>  <br> 7. Submission: Responses to this RFI are due no later than 2:00PM (Eastern), 30 May 2014.  Only electronic responses are requested.  Please submit all responses and any questions prior to full response to Scott Hodges via email at Scott.E.Hodges2.civ@mail.mil.  Please format the subject line of the response email as follows;  quote mark [Organization Name] response to RFI - Light-Weight Structures. quote mark  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<SUBJECT>Upgrade Thermo Scientific  ExactivePlus System to Q Exactive System
<SOLNBR>1130284
<RESPDATE>042114
<CONTACT>Virginia C. House, Contract Specialists, Phone 8705437405, Email virginia.house@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY <br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p><br />Part I: General Information (Introduction/Background/Scope)</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Facility for Biotechnology Resources (FBR). FBR provides an array of services, including the synthesis of oligonucleotides and peptides for scientists at CBER and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). These oligonucleotides and peptides are utilized in research ranging from gene amplification, DNA sequencing, studies of protein-protein interactions, vaccine development, etc. Crude oligonucleotides and peptides synthesized at FBR need to be purified for most applications. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system (ExactivePlus of Thermo Scientific) is used to confirm the molecular weights of synthetic products. The system however could be utilized to provide proteomic service by added functions of ion isolation and ion fragmentation for an analyte. The upgrading of ExactivePlus to Q Exactive will achieve this goal and expand the service provided by FBR; therefore purchase of upgrading components for converting ExactivePlus to Q Exactive Mass Spectrometry System is required. <br />II. Objectives: <br />Scientists at CBER and CDER conduct cutting-edge molecular biological research and review products related to pathogen identification, disease mechanisms, vaccine development (e.g., influenza and other viruses), safety of blood products, or protocols involving cellular, tissue and gene therapies, etc. Often studies require synthetic peptides for biochemical characterizations and vaccine development. In experiments involving cell or animal models, an important question is how cells or animals respond to a specific treatment or challenging. One tool for answering such critical question is to examine the change of proteins in target cells or animals, an area of study referred as proteomics. To date, the most effective way to assess the protein profile change is by LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). In this practice, proteins are digested into peptides and the peptides are subjected to electrospray ionization. The molecular weights (MW) of these peptide ions are determined, followed by fragmentation of ions to produce several daughter ions. Since the MWs of daughter ions are dependent on peptide sequences, through established software programs, it is possible to derive peptide sequences in a mixture, and to identify the proteins in the original sample where peptides are derived from. To be able to perform this highly sophisticate task, an LC-MS instrument has to be equipped with components needed for ion isolation and ion fragmentation, in addition to ion mass determination. Thus upgrading the existing LC-MS system (ExactivePlus) to a Q Exactive system is necessary, to provide proteomic service(s) and keep up with current trend in biological and biomedical investigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />This is a sources sought to determine the availability and capability of sources that can meet the requirements stated herein to upgrade existing Thermo Scientific ExactivePlus LC-MS system to Q Exactive System, and/or that can offer cost effective alternatives capable of meeting requirements listed in the Part I and Part II above. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />Part III: Technical Requirements:</p>
<p>Upgrades to existing ExactivePlus LC-MS system to Q Exactive System:</p>
<p>i) Hardware needed to enable MS2 function (ion isolation and fragmentation) capability from MS1 function (ion mass determination). Replace Q1 rod with the hyperbolic quadrupoles inside the mass spectrometer. <br />ii) Add advanced active beam guide to improve uptime and reduced noise, and increase robustness.<br />iii) Provide Nanospray Flex Ion Source kit for ion generation under extreme low flow rate (nano flow). <br />iv) Include all labor required and certification of the instrument.</p>
<p>A. Deliverables:<br />Site Upgrade, End Product - Thermo Scientific Q Exactive System. <br />B. Service Requirements:<br />Not less than a 1-year Warranty including parts and labor<br />Yearly service agreement for preventive and corrective maintenance beyond warranty period with up to four (4) 1-year options. <br />C. Delivery/Performance Address:</p>
<p>Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research<br />U.S. Food and Drug Administration<br />29 Lincoln Drive, Room 205<br />Bethesda, MD 20892<br />Part IV: Instructions to Prospective Respondents</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought shall unequivocally demonstrate that respondent can meet technical requirements for the intended purposes discussed above and/or that can provide cost effective alternatives.

<DESC>Introduction
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background<br />The mission of the Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is to ensure an end to the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic by supporting research that can lead to the prevention, treatment, and eventual cure of HIV disease.</p>
<p>DAIDS supports basic research as well as pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of various HIV eradication strategies. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies at clearing the latent HIV reservoir, a sensitive, reproducible assay capable of quantifying latent HIV is crucial. The best characterized assay today is the QVOA (Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay), also known as IUPM (Infectious Units Per Million) assay (Siliciano and Siliciano 2005), performed on highly purified resting CD4+ T cells under conditions that reverse latency and induce replication of HIV.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The objective of this contract is to provide the QVOA as a service to the HIV research community. This service will allow standardized QVOA measurements so that unbiased comparisons between different eradication strategies can be achieved. Widespread use of the assay will raise the standards for latent HIV detection and reduce the need for surrogate, less sensitive assays, presently used by some laboratories.</p>
<p>The scope of the work includes:<br />&bull;Performance of the QVOA <br />&bull;Development of alternatives to the QVOA. The aim will be the development of assays that are less costly, require smaller amounts of blood, and can be completed more rapidly while maintaining or exceeding the sensitivity of the QVOA.<br />&bull;Training investigators to perform the QVOA at the Respondent's site.</p>
<p>The Respondent shall use state-of-the art technologies to accomplish the objectives of the contract and shall incorporate new and improved technologies into activities when appropriate.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought: IT Project Management Support<br /><br />The National Gallery of Art is leading a project with six other leading museums (partners) to develop an open source document management system to serve the art conservation community. An initial version of this system was recently completed, built on Alfresco and other open source software modules. We are about to embark on the next phase of the project (approximately 18 month duration) during which the current system will be enhanced with additional functionality, improvements to the user interface, re-architecting the existing system to a multi-tenant operational model, and development of APIs for integration with museum collection management and digital asset <br />management systems.<br /><br />The National Gallery of Art is seeking immediate support for the IT management of this project. Small firms, including individuals, are encouraged to respond. The IT Project Management would provide day to day management of the technical aspects of this project, working in partnership with the Gallery's non-technical Project Manager. Duties would include:<br /><br />1. Close management of an offshore development organization and one or more other organizations that may assist in specialized areas, such as usability and interaction design.<br /><br />2. An in-depth understanding and management of requirements for this phase of the project as they are built using an agile development methodology. This responsibility implies day-to-day communication with the offshore development organization, in-depth review of hundreds of detailed use cases and requirements, leading the negotiations about high/medium/low priorities, and when the functionality is developed, the in-depth testing of the functionality.<br /><br />3. Technical leadership for the review process of all technical documentation for the project, which includes coordination with IT staff at the Partner institutions.<br /><br />4. Maintenance and reporting of project schedules, sufficiently detailed to ensure all work is tracked and coordinated.<br /><br />5. Development of draft materials for contract modifications and/or for future phases of the project, as required.
<p>Key background for the IT Project Manager: Experience managing multi-million dollar projects including development and configuration of any or all of the following classes of enterprise systems: document management, content management, digital asset management, workflow management.<br />Firms that are interested and feel they are qualified to meet the above requirements are invited to respond with a brief description of their qualifications (5 page limit) and sample resumes. The Gallery will review these submissions and may invite firms in for further discussions as part of this market research.<br /><br />Please also provide information (1 page limit) on existing contract vehicles and labor category rate(s) that could be used for this engagement and any specific requirements the need to be discussed around this support. All work will be done on-site at the Gallery during normal business hours. Due to budget limitations, we will be looking for rates that fall within the $75/hour to $110/hour range, based on the qualifications of the proposed personnel but we are open to discussions on your rates if they fall outside this range.</p>

<DESC>TITLE: Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) for the UH-72A Lakota Virtual Maintenance Trainer (VMT).  <br>  <br> Contract Vehicle: TBD  <br>  <br> Brief Summary: This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is being issued as a follow-on to the UH-72A VMT  Request for Information (RFI) dated 27 Nov 2013. Since the posting of the RFI, the Government has generated the technical documentation of this requirement and is hereby providing Industry with an opportunity to respond to this technical information. The UH-72A VMT technical documentation includes the following:  <br>  <br> - Draft Statement of Work (SOW) for the overall planned effort;  <br> - Draft Technical Specification for the UH-72A VMT  <br>  <br> Market research is being conducted to determine interested sources and technology capabilities of contractors for the procurement of the UH-72A VMT.  Interested sources are invited to provide a capability statement to deliver the UH-72A VMT capability as described in the attached technical documentation.  <br>  <br> BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  <br>  <br> The US Army added the UH-72A aircraft to its operational fleet in 2006.  Initial maintenance training efforts focused on providing experienced Army aviation maintainers with factory aircraft familiarization training to maintain the UH-72A fleet in an FAA approved environment. <br>  <br> Focus for UH-72A maintenance training is now shifting from contractor provided familiarization training to a US Army Institutional Training Course for UH-72A maintenance.  Training for UH-72A maintainers has recently been developed in accordance with (IAW) the US Army analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation (ADDIE) process.   <br>  <br> The VMT will comprise a collection of twelve (12) student workstations, one (1) IOS workstation, and one (1) hanger workstation.  Each individual workstation will provide a virtual practical exercise interactive workspace designed to support the performance of UH-72A maintenance tasks to task standards. <br>  <br> The VMT shall also have a training management capability.  Instructor/operators shall be able to retrieve, review, update, correct, delete, archive, and print selected individual student (by name or identification (ID) number) or group performance data. <br>  <br> The VMT instructional and student management content shall be exportable to SCORM compliant LMSs to support  quote mark reach-back quote mark  maintainer training through the Army Training Support Center (ATSC) Lifelong Learning Center (LLC) Blackboard system.  The VMT training content shall also be suitable for being downloaded to computers and mobile electronic devices to provide an additional VMT  quote mark reach back quote mark  ability so Army maintainers can practice or review UH-72A maintenance tasks at their convenience. <br>  <br> The VMT's architecture and design shall be open so that it shall be capable of growth for potential integration and use with other planned systems, e.g., a UH-72A hardware part-task maintenance trainer to support the practice of remove and install (R&I) tasks. <br>  <br> INTENT OF THIS SSN: <br>  <br>  To collect responses from offerors interested in providing a simulation capability for the UH-72A VMT. Capability statements will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research. Only experienced/qualified suppliers should respond. Offerors must demonstrate that they have established supply chain and manufacturing capabilities to produce the UH-72A VMT.   <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:  <br>  <br> The Government is currently developing an acquisition strategy for the UH-72A VMT. The Government anticipates award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis. The contract type for this effort has not yet been determined.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD - SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT <br>  <br> PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The Product Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainer (PM GCTT) has a requirement to provide software upgrades for both the fielded Image Generators (IGs) in the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) system and the IGs purchased under the CCTT Concurrency effort, to support the Concurrency fielding scheduled for March 2015.  The software upgrades shall support the M1A1 FEP, M1A1 SA, M1A2 SEPV2 and upcoming M2 module configurations developed under the CCTT Concurrency effort. The software upgrades shall provide support for ownship models, reticles and other critical CCTT Concurrency based enhancements.  <br>  <br> The software updates shall allow all CCTT manned module systems, to include RVS/RVTT, to continue to operate on a common IG solution. As a result, the Government intends to procure the following requirements: <br>  <br>  	Software upgrades, installation and testing of software to support the Concurrency effort for: <br> o	All fielded CCTT M1 and M2 modules <br> o	All fielded CCTT AAR's associated with the M1 and M2 modules  <br> o	All 3, 9, 10, and 11 channel IG systems purchased under the Concurrency effort <br>  <br>  	Software maintenance license <br>  <br>  	Continued software support during Concurrency fielding <br>  <br>  	O&M training for Camp Lejeune <br>  <br>  	Technical manual updates <br>  <br>  	Information Assurance (IA) support <br>  <br>  	Development for Windows 7  <br>  <br> ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government anticipates awarding a new Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Order (DO) to Rockwell Collins Simulation and Training Solutions, LLC (RC-STS) under PEO STRI's Omnibus Contract II (STOC II), W900KK-09-D-0350. <br>  <br> RC-STS is the only company that can successfully perform this effort as they have the relevant on-going CCTT and RVTT experience with a proven, fielded EPX-50 design that meets the CCTT IG upgrade and the CCTT RVTT IG production requirements.  The EPX-50 software and hardware, developed and owned by RC-STS, is fully integrated, tested and fielded with the CCTT baseline software. <br>  <br> The reuse of the existing EPX-50 design will reduce program risk, life cycle cost and schedule to ensure a quality end product.  It is crucial, in order to maintain training objectives, that the IG software upgrades be fully integrated, tested and delivered into a common solution across the CCTT family of systems in conjunction with the March 2015 concurrency fielding. <br>  <br> This order will be issued on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B),  quote mark Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. quote mark   <br>  <br> ESTIMATED ACQUISITION DOLLAR VALUE:  Approximately $3M <br>  <br> PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE/DELIVERY:  Delivery of the interim IG software upgrade package is due three months after contract award.  Delivery of the fieldable IG software upgrade package is due no later than December 1st, 2014.  <br>  <br> RESPONSES REQUESTED:  Contractors who can provide PM GCTT with the ability to meet the requirement to provide software upgrades for the CCTT IGs while continuing to operate on a common IG solution shall submit an affirmative, written response, not to exceed 10 pages, indicating their ability to meet the specific requirements outlined above.

No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification.  The Government will use any information received by the closing date of this notice to determine whether other sources are available and capable to satisfy this requirement. <br>  <br> POC: <br> Mr. Brian Serra <br> brian.d.serra.civ@mail.mil   <br> 407-208-3357 <br>

<DESC>Request for Information
Learning and Employee Development System (LEDS)

The U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Learning University (VALU) is aligned to VA's Office of Human Resources Administration (OHRA) and functions as the VA's corporate University.  VALU supports continuous learning and development to enhance leadership, occupational proficiencies, and personal growth of VA's 350,000 employees.  VA's current Talent Management System (TMS) is the Agency's official system of record for completing, recording, and reporting mandatory training for its employees as well as approximately 200,000 non-employees such as contractors, medical trainees, volunteers, etc. VA uses Plateau/SuccessFactors' Talent Management Suite which is nearing the end of its lifecycle and will no longer be supported as of August 2016.  A follow-on solution is required to ensure VA's strategic goals, major initiatives and mission-critical learning and development requirements receive uninterrupted support.  

The scope of the LEDS initiative is to implement a complete, integrated learning and employee development system.  This system must provide VA with the capability to manage users/ learners, supervisors, and administrators; develop, deliver, launch, complete, and track all learning content; facilitate creating standardized training content; support a mobile learning strategy; support VA accreditation needs which includes healthcare, financial, government, and professional organizations; deliver web-based instruction using a variety of delivery media; support blended instruction utilizing a variety of asynchronous and synchronous delivery media; support social learning; provide standard, custom, and ad-hoc reporting along with customizable dashboards; support functions such as competency assessment and management, electronic Individual Development Plans (IDPs), gap analysis, and workforce analytics; integrate performance management, including 360- and 180-degree assessments.

Technically, the system must be accessible to users and able to deliver dynamic content inside and outside of the VA firewall, and be robust enough to handle 1 million learning users, 25,000 administrators, and 95 million transactions daily. The system must be able to interface with a variety of internal and external systems to create and update user records, record learning, and handle batch transaction processing. Standard VA Enterprise requirements such as Security, Privacy, Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) architecture, and Section 508 compliance apply. Also, per VA guidelines for records management, at least the past seven years of learning records must remain accessible for reporting.

All companies interested in participating in this effort please note their interest and provide indication of their respective capabilities to provide the enterprise requirements described in the attached LEDS Requirements Matrix spreadsheet. The company must also respond to the following questions:

1.	Provide a brief summary or capabilities statement of your technical approach to meet the requirements.
2.	Provide a list of the applications or systems your company would deliver to meet the stated requirements.
3.	What approximate percentage of the proposed solution can provide the functionality described in the LEDS Requirements Matrix "out of the box" (i.e., already available to customers without the need for customization)?
4.	Provide a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) cost to implement your proposed solution with the functionality, licenses, and hosting to support the attached requirements well as the migration of existing VA data, content, and integrations.  Please also include an estimate of maintenance costs of the solution once it has reached sustainment.  
5.	What is the timeframe you would require to implement the proposed solution from award to full operational capability, including the migration of existing VA data, content, and integrations?
6.	Identify current customers and provide references (name, phone number, and email address) for the organizations you support with a similar size and scope to VA. 
7.	Please denote the business size for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services.  Please include company name, company address, and DUNS Number (if applicable).  Also, please indicate if you, your teammates and/or subcontractors are a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or a Veteran Owned Small Business.
8.	Please indicate if you are a contract holder on any Government contract vehicles where your company's services can be acquired (e.g. GSA Federal Supply Schedule or other Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts).  
This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered an Invitation for Bid, Request for Task Execution Plan, Request for Quotation or a Request for Proposal.  Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  The information provided may be used by the VA in developing its acquisition strategy and Performance Work Statement.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.

<a href="mailto:david.a.gannon.civ@mail.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION: <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), in coordination with the Project Director Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (PD CHESS) is issuing this  Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information from industry regarding the ability to provide IT services on behalf of the Department of the Army. The estimated value of services within the scope of this RFI is $11B to $15B over a 5 year period of performance. <br>  <br> 2. PURPOSE: <br>  <br> The intent of this RFI is to obtain information regarding the ability to provide IT services for a follow-on IT service contract to replace ITES-2S, on behalf of the Department of the Army. The US Army is seeking the following: <br>  <br>   Information regarding industry interest and capabilities in participation in the concept described below, and  <br>   Specific feedback and comments from industry regarding the grouping of the IT Services task areas in accordance with the attached questionnaire.   <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information only. This RFI is being conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e). No contract will be awarded from this announcement and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in response to this RFI. As such, this RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute any obligation on the part of the US Army. <br>  <br> Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or solicitation, should one be issued. All submissions become US Army property and will not be returned. All information received in response to this notice that is marked 'Proprietary' will be handled accordingly. <br>  <br> 3. PROGRAM BACKGROUND: <br>  <br> The ITES-2S scope includes a full range of services and solutions necessary for the Army to satisfy its support of the Army enterprise infrastructure and infostructure goals with Information Technology (IT) services worldwide.  The scope includes the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) requirements as defined in Army Regulation 25-1 (AR 25-1).  ITES-2S are services-based solutions under which contractors may be required to provide a full range of IT equipment.  Therefore, end-to-end solutions to satisfy worldwide development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment requirements are included.  Additionally included is support to analyze requirements, develop and implement recommended solutions, and operate and maintain legacy systems, and equipment (The current ITES-2S Labor Categories are listed in Attachment 2).  It is the intention of the Government to establish a scope that is broad, sufficiently flexible to satisfy requirements that may change over the period of performance, and fully comprehensive so as to embrace the full complement of services that relate to IT.  The U.S. Army, Department of Defense, or any other Federal Agencies are authorized to fulfill requirements under ITES-2S. <br> The Government has the requirement to provide IT services, as a follow-on to ITES-2S, to both the Army warfighter and civilians supporting the Army business operations, along with mission partners in modernizing and maintaining LandWarNet.  LandWarNet links the Army's forces around the world and provides on-the-move capability to maneuver forces while pushing access down to the lowest tactical level and from that foxhole back to their home station. <br> Because of the depth and breadth of the services required to satisfy the IT requirement, the Government seeks information and advice on how to provide these services in a manner that will result in best value, for example, appropriately qualified personnel at a cost that provides value to both the Government and the customer and in a manner that is flexible to the vendor, e.g., multiple contracts that are narrower in scope. <br> This is an RFI looking for innovative solutions in providing IT service contracts that will enhance the Army customer's (and possibly other DoD and federal agencies) ability to support their IT requirements.  The Government is looking for a way of purchasing services that could break out the services into different suites or catalogs in accordance with the new DoD Services taxonomy. <br> 4. TARGET AUDIENCE: <br>  <br> All sources, with the capability as described herein, are requested and encouraged to respond to this RFI. <br>  <br> 5. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS: <br>  <br> In an effort to gather information in a manner which can be analyzed, the US Army is requesting responses in three separate Sections (1) General Information; (2) Capability Questionnaire; and (3) General Feedback and Comments regarding the proposed concept and software products indicated (optional). <br>  <br> Instructions for Section 1: General Information <br>  <br> In order for a company's responses to Section 2 and Section 3 to be considered for the Government's analysis, the completion of Section 1, General Information, must be provided. <br>  <br> Instructions for Section 2: Questionnaire <br>  <br> The government is seeking comments from industry regarding the overall concept of the proposed ITES 3S contract.

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO CONDUCT A SOLE SOURCE ACQUISITION utilizing the test procedures prescribed under FAR Subpart 13.5.  The Mission and Installation Contracting Command, Fort Sam Houston Contracting Office on behalf of the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (OACSIM) intends to negotiate and award a contract to URS Group in accordance with FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii), because only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique.  This order will be issued to URS Group located at 2450 Crystal Drive, Suite 500, Arlington, VA, 22202 to procure services in support of BOS Requirements Model (BRM), Environmental Quality (BRM-EQ).  This requirement provides modeling support to estimate the Army's Environmental Quality requirements.  The requirement's objective is to sustain the capability to model recurring Environmental Quality requirements at a level of detail and fidelity necessary to inform the Installation Program Evaluation Group Program Objective Memoranda (II PEG POM) requirements determination process.  The method used to determine requirements must meet the validation criteria established by the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Cost and Economics (DASA-CE).  Environmental Quality requirements  must be able to be organized, aggregated, and filtered to be translatable to multiple stakeholder groups and to feed  systems and databases including, but not limited to, the Army's Requirements Builder (R-Builder) and the Office of the Secretary of Defense Select and Native Programming Data Input System (SNaP).  This action will result in a Firm-Fixed-Price contract with a period of performance one base year and two option years, beginning 19 May 2014.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541620 with a size standard of $14M. <br> URS Group has the necessary knowledge, experience, staff, and methodology as validated by the DASA-CE to maintain services.  No source other than the incumbent can satisfy this need given the technical capability for this requirement would require DASA-CE validation which can take anywhere from months to years to achieve, resulting in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements and directly impacting the II PEG POM process.  For the reasons noted above, MICC-FSH intends to award a contract to URS Group to ensure that OACIM is able to meet its mission. <br> No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the OACSIM's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 5 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.  All questions and/or responses must be directed to Shannon Kennedy-Butler via e-mail at Shannon.l.kennedy-butler.civ@mail.mil.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  Please note a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition will be posted within 14 days of award. <br>

<DESC>This procurement action is being conducted under FAR 6.302-1 with the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement; therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly from this notice. <p> This procurement provides for the necessary extension of the current contract with Call Henry, Inc. due to a GAO protest of the follow-on award and subsequent appeal to The Federal Court of Claims. The contract provides facility operation, repair, and maintenance services at the NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio 44135.	The work effort includes preventive maintenance; Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM); emergency, urgent and routine trouble calls; minor service requests; operation of the centralized steam plant and outlying boilers; operations and maintenance of high voltage electrical distribution systems; operations and maintenance of fire, security and safety alarms and systems; operations and maintenance of HVAC systems and equipment; structural maintenance; repairs and minor modifications; and snow removal. A modification to the existing contract is intended in order to avoid disruption of O&M services as well as to provide continuity of services and avoid unacceptable delays and significant cost to the Government; an award to other than Call Henry, Inc risks the degradation of the structural integrity overall facility operating systems, and Life safety systems.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Purchase to Reed Elsevier (Lexis Nexis)
Posted Date: April 14, 2014
Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Headquarters Procurement Operations Division 
Response Date: April 24, 2014, 5:00pm EST
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Reed Elsevier for an electronic database solution for real-time identity proofing. The Agency requires an electronic solution for real-time identity proofing, which currently relies on an automated look up service against Reed Elsevier Company?s Lexis Nexis database. Under the Cross-Media Electronic Reporting Regulation (CROMERR), EPA program offices are required to identity proof its stakeholders, and therefore is an important function that the EPA must conduct. The Lexis Nexis automated look up service is proprietary to Lexis Nexis; and it is developed and maintained by Reed Elsevier. It is not developed or maintained by any other vendor or distributor. Similarly, software upgrades and maintenance made available through the software agreement we wish to purchase are available through no other vendor or distributor other than Reed Elsevier.
In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One responsible source and no other supplies or services satisfy the Agency's requirements. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. 
Responses to this posting must be in writing.
The point of contact for this requirement is Andrew Howe, Contracting Officer, at howe.andrew@epa.gov.

Proposed Vendor: Partnership for the Delaware Estuary; Duns# 122823730 
Synopsis: THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order under Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13.106-1(b). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Monitoring and Assessment was awarded funding for its research on characterizing and assessing the concentrations of dissolved and total nutrients and chlorophyll in the surficial and mi-thermocline waters of the Delaware Estuary.  As a result, the EPA requires a contractor to collect samples for analysis in the Delaware Bay. This effort will cover a tentative period of performance of Date of Award plus one year. EPA intends to award a sole source purchase order to Partnership for the Delaware Estuary located at 110 South Poplar Street, Suite 202 Wilmington, DE 19801. This requirement is to collect seawater samples in the Delaware Bay for EPA determination of nutrient relationships with chlorophyll a (blooms), dissolved oxygen, suspended solids, carbo nate chemistry, and benthic communities. On or before September 30, 214, the contractor shall provide a summary report describing the completed field sampling and any quality control issues encountered. Partnership for the Delaware Estuary is the only company that has a unique on-the-ground knowledge of the estuary, its sampling challenges, bathymetry, habitat distribution, weather and surf conditions necessary for sampling, and the interaction of sampling activities with the navigational hazards in the area where the work is to be performed. EPA knows of no other capable vendor who can satisfy this requirement; because of the narrow seasonal sampling window, logistics need to be planned and handled accordingly. Any interested vendors that believe they can satisfy this requirement, may submit their capabilities, qualifications and product literature fully supporting that their product meets all of the specifications contained in Attachment 1_SOW by e-mail to Christie Deskiew icz no later than 10:00 a.m. EDT, on April 30, 2014. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The Detroit office opened in 2012, and the other offices are scheduled to all be fully operational in 2014/2015. With offices in every time zone, the USPTO has a geographic distribution designed to foster the contributions that intellectual property make to a growing economy.<br />The satellite offices focus on the USPTO's core mission of granting intellectual property rights to applicants and doing outreach and education to the innovation community. Other functions, including finance and accounting will be based out of the USPTO Alexandria campus. <br /><br />The location within Silicon Valley has been selected, and in accordance with Executive Order 12072, it will be in San Jose.  The office is scheduled to be operational in the July 2015 timeframe.<br /><br />The permanent location of the USPTO Silicon Valley Office in San Jose will help the USPTO move toward establishing a more robust and permanent west coast presence.  That in turn will assist the Office to better serve entrepreneurs by helping disseminate educational programming on how to protect Intellectual Property (IP), so that start-ups and businesses can attract capital, put their business plans into action, and help create more jobs.  Opening of the permanent office in San Jose will improve USPTO engagement with innovators in the western United States, and potentially provide the agency with tremendous recruiting opportunities, all of which are vital to reducing backlogs, meeting the unique needs of area start-ups and getting new technologies to market faster.  Further the USPTO will use this location in the Silicon Valley to establish regionally tailored educational services about the IP system, train examiners on the unique industries that make up the Valley, and allow the public to access USPTO's comprehensive search databases. <br /> <br />The USPTO intends to negotiate and award a lease to San Jose City Hall NAICS 531120 Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings. The anticipated lease term is one base period of five years, with multiple option years to extend.<br />As a result of USPTO's exemption from the Competition in Contracting Act, the above requirement is being procured using the Alternative Competition Method in accordance with Patent and Trademarks Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) Part 6 and the Patent and Trademark Office Efficiency Act 35 U.S.C.2(b)(4)(A).<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.<br />

52.204-99 SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT REGISTRATION (DEVIATION)(AUG 2012)

(a)  Definitions.
  As used in this clause-
 
"Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the retired primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.
"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-
  (1)  A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Information Service to identify a commercial or Government entity; or
  (2)  A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLA records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."

"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc.
 (D&B) to identify unique business entities.

"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.

"Registered in the SAM database" means that-

  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 

  (2)  The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 

  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active".
 The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process.

"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.  It includes-

  (1)  Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;

  (2)  Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and

  (3)  The list of all parties suspended, proposed for debarment, debarred, declared ineligible, or excluded or disqualified under the nonprocurement common rule by agencies, Government corporations, or by the Government Accountability Office.

 
(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.

(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

  (1) A contractor may obtain a DUNS number-

    (i)  Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or

    (ii)  If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.
 The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

  (2)  The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information:

    (i)  Company legal business name.

    (ii)  Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.

    (iii)  Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code.

    (iv)  Company mailing address, city, state and Zip Code (if separate from physical).

    (v)  Company telephone number.

    (vi)  Date the company was started.

    (vii)  Number of employees at your location.

    (viii)  Chief executive officer/key manager.

    (ix)  Line of business (industry).

    (x)  Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).

(d)  Reserved.

(e)  Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering.
  Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing.

(f)  The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-
      (A)  Change the name in the SAM database; 
      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and
      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.
 

    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).
 Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Instant Cold Packs. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Instant Cold Packs products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Instant Cold Packs. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Instant Cold Packs will be established approximately September 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately October 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Instant Cold Packs. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Instant Cold Packs.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Instant Cold Packs. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $349,084.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Three product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. The three product groups represent the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. These three items are the requirement for addition to the QSL and accounts for 100% ($348,084.00) of the total volume in sales. The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below</strong>. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></span></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative.

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.

It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. POC is Karl Harvey (karl.l.harvey2.civ@mail.mil) <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [X] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [X] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on PRICE. <BR> <BR>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>DTAR1052.232-7003 Electronic Invoicing and Payment Requirements for the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) (Aug 2012)<br />The U.S. Department of the Treasury, Financial Managements Internet Payment Platform (IPP) is a government-wide electronic payment information service that replaces the Payment Advice Internet Delivery (PAID) system. IPP allows vendors to receive their remittance information from their financial institution. Effective October 31, 2008, IPP replaced the PAID system. Former PAID users have been automatically migrated to IPP and need to complete the initial provisioning process from the new user ID, temporary password, and web address sent by Treasury. This is necessary in order to log in to the IPP and view or download payment information. New vendors may register on-line at https://ipp.gov. For additional information, refer to the IPP Customer Support at (866) 973-3131.<br />The IPP will continue to support the following notification services previously offered by PAID: Web access only to remittance data, no payment notification emails sent, payment notification without remittance detail, and payment notification with remittance detail. Users may select event-driven notifications and schedule the frequency. Vendors can only access their own payment data. IPP remittance information includes the following data: ACH trace number, supplier name, agency name, payment status, issue date, invoice number, PO number, invoice amount, discount amount, payment amount, bank name, and bank address. The IPP will collect payment data for 18 months, which will be available for search, display and download. Payment information will be uploaded to the IPP daily from Treasury systems on the date of payment.</p>

In accordance with HIPAA, the Contractor may be required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with VA.

However, like other components of the Department, and not withstanding any other provisions of the task order, the Contractor is restricted from making disclosures of VA records, or information contained in such records, to which it may have access, except to the extent that explicit disclosure authority from VA has been received.  The Contractor is subject to the same penalties and liabilities for unauthorized disclosures of such records as VA.

The Pharmacy office will be responsible for verifying all work performed by the contractor.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

    (2) __ Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

      (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)
    (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
    (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>The Department of Navy seeks to award a Lease for the acquisition of mountain space on an existing communications tower in the Seaford area of Sussex County, Delaware, for one year with nine (9) additional one-year renewal options.

The rentable space must meet the following technical requirements: 
		
LOCATION- The leased property must be within a two and a half (2.5) mile radius centered at a Latitude of -75.588427 and a Longitude of 38.636425, within the Seaford area of Sussex County Delaware, on the map labeled as Attachment A to Solicitation for Offer (SFO) No. N40080LI0056.  In addition, the tower must be able to mount the required antenna(s) on a side that faces the inside of the special use airspace (SUA).
  This SUA is shown as the outer edges in the map labeled as Attachment B to SFO No. N40080LI0056. 

ANTENNA HEIGHT- A tower with a minimum height of 150 feet above ground level, with the capability of holding an antenna 150 feet above ground level.

The Offeror to be selected for the Lease will be that Offeror whose offer will be based on an objective lowest price technically acceptable determination, including possible cost of relocation of existing equipment, considering only the information submitted in response to the SFO; provided, however, that the Government may at its option, and without any liability, choose to reject any and all offers without a requirement for justification.  Offerors will be given the opportunity to clarify minor or clerical errors.
  Award will be made after evaluating proposals and without discussions.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and Part 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-14-Q-200092 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-72.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411.  The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), Airbus Helicopter France and JPR France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items.  Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.    

SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET HSCG38-14-Q-200092 - REQUIREMENTS FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.

Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.

NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED.  ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. 

The Government reserves the right to withhold any item or group of items contained in this solicitation upon award.  The Government reserves the right to make a single award, no award, or multiple awards if after considering the additional administrative costs it is in the Governments best interest to do so.  The Government shall assume, for the purpose of making multiple awards, that $500 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation.  Individual awards shall be for the items or combinations of items that result in the lowest cost to the Government including the assumed administrative costs.  

NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br /></p>

(c) "Claim," as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under the Act until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under the Act.

(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.

(iii) The certification shall state as follows: "I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor."
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officer's decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in the Act.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor's specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.
(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.

Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable.

52.237-2 -- Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment, and Vegetation (Apr 1984).
The Contractor shall use reasonable care to avoid damaging existing buildings, equipment, and vegetation on the Government installation.

<DESC>*** 14 April 2014 ***
<p>There are some additional questions that were received for this solicitation. The question and engineer's response are provided below:</p>
<p>3.3.3 1 year Stability Specifications and Calibration Uncertainties</p>
<p>PD Statement: Specifications for the Teraohmmeter shall include a breakout of 1 year stability specifications and calibration uncertainties. These specifications and uncertainties shall also be included in the documentation and supplied by the contractor. Teraohmmeter 1 year measurement uncertainties and short term stabilities shall include reference resistor uncertainties and dielectric effects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: Can you confirm that all Specifications, Measurement Uncertainties, and Calibration Uncertainties are to include repeatability? For high resistance measurements repeatability often has a higher contribution to uncertainty than the standard deviation of a single measurement which is particularly important when determining the uncertainty related to "Short Term Stability" specifications.</p>
<p>Response: Yes, the repeatability should be included in the uncertainties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: What are the uncertainties of the reference resistors used with the teraohmmeter. This is needed for uncertainty analysis for both 1 year and short term measurements to ensure conformance to the PD.</p>
<p>Response: We can provide the uncertainties if needed. If it is a direct measurement type meter then it is an absolute uncertainty and the reference resistor uncertainties are not needed.</p>
<p><br />3.3.4 Short Term Stability:</p>
<p><br />PD Statement: The Teraohmmeter shall meet or exceed the following Short Term Stability when operated within the temperature range of 23&#730;C &plusmn;2&#730;C and within a 3 hour period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: Are these specifications in the Teraohmmeter PD (i.e. 14E-108A-DC Rev 3 21 March 2014) based on a Direct Measurement capability where no reference resistance standard is required to make the measurement? Specifically once the Teraohmmeter is calibrated, must all specifications be met for a period of one year after the calibration without the requirement of using a reference resistance standard to make a measurement in Ratio or Bridge or Transfer Mode; and without the requirement of re-calibrating the Teraohmmeter "on-use" in order to meet the PD specifications?</p>
<p>Response: That is correct, the 1 year specifications in the PD should be the specifications for at least 1 year after the Teraohmmeter has been calibrated.</p>
<p>Question: 3.3.3 1 Year Stability Specifications and Calibration Uncertainties: <br />PD Statement: Specifications for the Teraohmmeter shall include a breakout of 1 year stability specifications and calibration uncertainties. These specifications and uncertainties shall also be included in the documentation and supplied by the contractor.</p>
<p>Does this mean that this is to be supplied in the technical response or with delivery of first unit if contract is awarded?</p>
<p>Response: We would like to see the specifications with the technical response.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment, Amendment 0001, is to update Attachment A, Pricing Sheet, and extend the solicitation response by date to 8:00 a.m. EST, Wednesday, 16 April 2014.&nbsp; All other terms and conditions remain the same<br /><br />The United States Department of Education (Department), Office of Management (OM), Security Services administers the personnel, physical, information and continuity of operations of the Department's Security Services Program. The Department has a requirement to ensure installation and maintenance of access control systems and equipment for identification of all individuals into all future facilities.
<p>The Department has a continuous requirement for the installation and maintenance of security systems at its facilities that are fully compatible with the current existing infrastructure to ensure proper monitoring and access control in accordance with the following Federal laws, directives, and policies:</p>
<p>1. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) addresses the problem of ongoing backlogs and timeliness delays in the process for background investigations and granting of security clearances. The purpose of the IRTPA is to reform the intelligence community and the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the United States Government.</p>
<p>2. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12: Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors (HSPD 12) requires all Federal agencies to complete background investigations prior to issuance of the HSPD 12/Personal Identity Verification Identification (PIV ID) credentials to enhance security, increase Government efficiency, reduce identity fraud, and protect personal privacy by establishing a mandatory, Government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the Federal Government to its employees and contractors (including contractor employees). HSPD 12 mandates a Federal standard for secure and reliable forms of identification.</p>
<p>3. National Security Presidential Directive-51/Homeland Security Presidential Directive-20 (NSPD-51/HSPD-20), National Continuity Policy emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive national program involving all government levels and the private sector for integrated and scalable continuity planning. NSPD-51/HSPD-20 prescribes continuity requirements for all executive departments and agencies, and provides continuity guidance for the states, territories, tribal and local governments, and private sector organizations.</p>
<p>4. National Continuity Policy Implementation Plan (NCPIP) directs Federal agencies to implement Continuity of Operations (COOP), Continuity of Government (COG) and continuing performance of National essential functions. COOP is an effort within organizations to ensure that Mission Essential Functions continue to be performed during a wide range of emergencies, including localized acts of nature, accidents, and technological or attack-related emergencies. The purpose of COG is a coordinated effort within each branch of government to ensure that national essential functions continue to be performed during a catastrophic emergency. It provides directive guidance to assist federal organizations in developing continuity plans and programs, to include the identification of Mission Essential Functions (MEFs) and Primary Mission Essential Functions (PMEFs), that support the eight National Essential Functions (NEFs)-the most critical functions necessary for leading and sustaining our Nation during a catastrophic emergency.</p>
<p>5. Federal Information Processing Standards 201 (FIPS PUB 201: Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors) specifies the architecture and technical requirements for a common identification standard for Federal employees and contractor employees pursuant to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002. The overall goal is to achieve appropriate security assurance for multiple applications by efficiently verifying the claimed identity of individuals seeking physical access to Federally-controlled Government facilities and electronic access to Government information systems.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The principal place of performance shall be at the Department's Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) Headquarters building located at 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, D.C. 20202.</p>
<p>Interested sources must submit information that demonstrates their ability to meet the requirements above, no later than April 14, 2014 at 12:00 PM, E.S.T. Clarification questions must be submitted by 12:00 PM EST on April 4, 2014. Any proposals must be submitted electronically to the attention of Holly.Le@ed.gov, Contract Specialist, with a concurrent copy to Desandre.Woodard@ed.gov, Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Department anticipates awarding this requirement as an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract type with firm-fixed priced orders. Proposals must be complete, self-sufficient, and respond directly to the requirements of this solicitation to assure timely and equitable evaluation of proposals in accordance with FAR 52.212-1.</p>
<p>Below is a list of contract line item numbers including options:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: Base Period: May 1, 2014 to April 30, 2015<br />CLIN 0002: Option Period 1: May 1, 2015 to April 30, 2016<br />CLIN 0003: Option Period 2: May 1, 2016 to April 30, 2017<br />CLIN 0004: Option Period 3: May 1, 2016 to April 30, 2017<br />CLIN 0005: Option Period 4: May 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019</p>
<p>In order to evaluate pricing for FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, the Department intends on using the contractor's base or option monthly pricing for the 6-month extension, if exercised.</p>
<p>A Firm-Fixed-Price Order, Task Order 1, will be issued concurrently with the award of the IDIQ in order to meet the minimum requirement at the order level and also to meet the base requirements of the IDIQ contract. The offeror shall provide unit pricing information (highlighted in blue) under Attachment A1 of this combined synopsis/solicitation. The offeror shall insert the proposed unit prices, to include any applicable discounts to Attachment A1.</p>
<p>Proposals may be submitted on a company letterhead. Proposals shall include the solicitation number, company name, point of contact, address, phone number, email, fax number, tax identification number, DUNS number, and business size status (e.g., Other than Small, 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, HUBZone, Woman Owned Small Business, Etc.). Offer must be valid for 45 calendar days after submission. Proposals are limited to five (5) pages, including a cover page.</p>
<p>Please note that offerors must include a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items and Department of Education Acquisition Regulation (EDAR) Provision 3452.209-71 - Conflict of Interest Certification. In addition, the offeror must identify the contract administrator as required by General Provision 306-8. This solicitation and its corresponding provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Number 2005-72.</p>
<p>Offerors will be evaluated based on price and ability to meet the solicitation requirements. The basis for the award will be best value through trade-offs; Price will be an important factor, however, price will be less important than non-price factors both individually and when combined. Therefore, the Department may award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. See Attachment B for Applicable Clauses and Evaluation.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to revise the Description of Items in the Combination synopsis / solicitation and to answer questions posed by vendors via Email to the Contract Specialist.
<p>The DESCRIPTION OF ITEMS: is hereby replaced in its entirety with the following: <br />The Defense Distribution Center Red River, Texas (DDRT) has a requirement for a contractor to provide all labor, equipment, material, supervision, and transportation required to provide and deliver propane gas to be used for the fueling of Material Handling Equipment. This service will provide for the refilling of one (1) each Government owned 500 gallon propane tank located at Building 595 and three (3) 500 gallon contractor owned propane tanks located at Building 499, 436, and 522. The contractor will top off all tanks twice a week. The estimated yearly usage is 74,000 gallons. The Period of Performance is 1 May 2014 through 30 April, 2015. This will be a firm fixed price type contract with an economic price adjustment.</p>
<p>The following Vendor Questions are hereby Answered:</p>
<p>Question One: With respect to Solicitation number SP3300-14-Q-0068; Will you consider the "FAR "52.219-4 -- PRICE EVALUATION PREFERENCE" for<br />active standing Hubzone firm's since this is primarily UNRESTRICTED"<br />procurement?</p>
<p>Answer One: It is in the best interest of the Government to unrestricted competition for this acquisition because it is not known if competition will be obtained from two or more small business concerns from Hubzones. Government has limited sources available in the Red River area. Previous contracts and continued Market Research have revealed limited vendors able to supply this service to the Red River area.</p>
<p>Question Two: What is the propane being used for? Is this for the onsite equipment? Or for heating?</p>
<p>Answer Two: The propane will be used for fueling of onsite Material Handling Equipment.</p>
<p>Question Three: Regarding the three tanks that will be provided to Red River Military facility in Texarkana, Texas. What type of tanks are these? Are they used to refill smaller propane tanks? Or are they used to ie, heat a building. What type of release valve to they require?</p>
<p>Answer Three: The One Government Owned Tank is 500 gallon, Manufactured by Eveready Gas Systems, Model #A500H. These larger tanks are used to refill smaller propane tanks. They are not used to heat buildings. The type of release valve they require is 250 PSI @ 125 degrees F working pressure.</p>
<p><br />Question Four: We need to know if you are willing to price the propane via ", a "fixed" or "floating" price structure. I have bid some state and federal contracts that are based on an "index" price - such as the Mt. Belvieu daily posted price plus a fixed margin. Were you willing to go by this or just the 10% above the fixed price?</p>
<p>Answer Four: The Pricing structure for Line Item CLIN 0001 will remain as stated in the combined synopsis / solicitation. Please reference DLAD 52.216-9067 - ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT (LIQUID PROPANE GAS) (JAN 2013).</p>
<p>Question Five: Can you clarify the last sentence in the description of items paragraph? The solicitation states "This will be a firm fixed price type contract with an economic price adjustment" I need some clarification on this.</p>
<p>Answer Five: Please reference DLAD 52.216-9067 - ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT (LIQUID PROPANE GAS) (JAN 2013).</p>
<p><br />All further Vendor Questions related to this acquisition must be submitted via email to Michael.Minto@dla.mil no later than 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on April 18th, 2014.<br /><br /><br /><br />Amendment 00002</p>
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to answer a question posed by a vendors via Email to the Contract Specialist.</p>
<p><br />The following Vendor Question is hereby answered:</p>
<p>Question One: Who currently owns the tanks that are onsite?</p>
<p><br />Answer One: One Tank is Government Owned. The other Tanks will be provided by the Vendor. The current tanks are being supplied by:<br />AmerigasPropane, L.P. <br />460 N Gulph Rd. <br />King of Prussia, Pa 19406-2815</p>
<p><br />The questions and answer time period is hereby closed in relation to this solicitation.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the System for Award Management at http://sam.gov <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the Online Representatives and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

POC is Karl Harvey (karl.l.harvey2.civ@mail.mil) <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [X] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [X] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on PRICE. <BR> <BR>

In the event the Contractor or contract employee effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the KO, the change will be considered to have been without authority, and no adjustment will be made in the contract price under the Changes clause or any other clause to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written noticeto the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation.

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

April 14, 2014

1.	 Section C (included below) indicates that "Surveys must be performed by a licensed Fire Protection Engineer or" and also "surveys shall be reviewed and signed off by a licensed or degreed Fire Protection Engineer." Is it intended that the survey is to be performed by an FPE and also reviewed by an FPE? Will it be sufficient for the survey to be performed by a highly experienced non-FPE as long as it is reviewed by an FPE?
ANSWER:  Work may be performed by a highly experienced non-FPE so long as the final product is reviewed and contains the FPE signature verifying and certifying the final product as true and accurate.

<DESC>Questions about 246-2014-R-0009 Multi-Trade Improvements Project El Reno Health Clinic
<p>1. Will additional days be added for the added work of storefront, concrete and handrails?</p>
<p>Response: Due to the circumstances of the old El Reno Clinic being hit by a tornado it is imperative to open this clinic as soon as possible. Therefore no additional time will be added.</p>
<p>2. Concrete added to original request requires set up time (cure time) before core drilling for handrails, needs additional contract time?</p>
<p>Response: See answer to question 1</p>
<p>3. Store front items have a long lead time to be ordered, manufactured &amp; delivered, same for electronic items, additional time needs added for this.</p>
<p>Response: See answer to question 1</p>
<p>4. Additional time should be added for government approval of submittals or this should be outside/before NTP is issued?</p>
<p>Response: The Government will review submittals quickly and efficiently so not to cause undue delay to the contractor.</p>
<p>5. Directions state to request final inspection time and date two weeks before completion of project, since whole project has only been allotted 4 weeks this request seems impracticable and unreasonable, per directions you are to request finals only half way thru project, request addition time added.</p>
<p>Response: The Government is agreeable with making request two weeks before finals</p>
<p>6. Requirement to have as built completed at time of final inspection seams unreasonable, as built can't be completed until project is totally completed and it takes a little time usually 30-45 days to engage an engineering tec, get on schedule and complete as-built. Request additional time</p>
<p>Response: The Government is agreeable to additional time for the as-builts.</p>
<p>7. Nothing is mentioned about delays caused by pedestrians and auto traffic or being unable to work due to on-going operations at the site, request this be addressed.</p>
<p>Response: This is currently a non-operational clinic</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. <br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). <br /><br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72 effective January 30, 2014.<br /><br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing - with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business. Simplified acquisition procedures shall be utilized. The non-manufacturer rule applies to this requirement. However, the Small Business Administration has a class waiver in effect as of August 24, 2012 for the purchase of HPLC systems.<br /><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology requires a high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) system. The system will be used to separate complex hydrolysates of DNA and proteins isolated from mammalian tissues or cultured cells.<br /><br />The item to be acquired is an HPLC system to be used as coupled to NIST's present Thermo Tandem Mass Spectrometer (MS/MS) instrument. To provide the greatest functionality and ease of use, both the HPLC and MS/MS components must work together using one instrument control software package that must be able to control both the HPLC and the Thermo MS/MS instrument. This means that the HPLC system must have a single point interface with Thermo Xcalibur software using DCMSLink. This is the minimum requirement. In addition, it is pertinent that the system have a dual ternary rapid gradient pump system, which will permit on-line solid phase extraction.<br /><br /><strong>This is a Brand Name Only Requirement. Brand name justification is based on the following:<br /></strong><strong><br />NIST requires that the High Performance Liquid Chromatograph System have a single point interface with Thermo Xcalibur Software using DCMS Link. This is required so that one software package can control the required HPLC system as well as an existing NIST-owned Thermo Tandem Mass Spectrometer.

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest.

To protect the fiberglass canisters from banding chafe during shipment, the rafts would have padding under the bands across the top and wooden chocks installed on the pallet.  That same type of protection must be installed prior to shipment back to USNA. The actual transportation must be in an "enclosed carrier" (tractor-trailer) and not on an open flat-bed trailer. <BR> <BR>

A time extension for proposals has been granted and the new due date is May 5, 2014.  <br>    <br>    <br>  The due date for proposals has changed to May 1, 2014 and is amended as attached.   <br>      <br>      <br>   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.      <br>        <br>    This procurement was originally posted to this site under contract number W912ER-14-0003.      <br>        <br>    The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, and technical supervision to complete the repairs and upgrades to the existing ship-lift at the Kuwait Naval Base.  The ship-lift operating system will be current, meeting the 2014 standards, but shall include parts, equipment and materials previously procured by the U.S. Government in 2012.  A list of these items is attached in the Appendix to this Scope of Work.  It is recommended that the Contractor visit the site and familiarize himself with the existing conditions prior to the submission of their proposal.  Site visit allows for the Contractor to gain the necessary knowledge of the existing conditions and equipment.    <br>        <br>    A significant amount of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) shall be installed by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall use to the fullest extent possible all GFE.  The U.S. Government has accepted this equipment and it has been secured and stored by the Kuwait government.  The Contractor shall inspect the GFE and verify the amount and condition of the parts.  If the contractor finds deviations, they shall contact the Contracting Officer immediately.      <br>        <br>    Due to proprietary constraints the Contractor will not have access to any ship-lift OEM drawings or documentation for both the original equipment or the current GFE.    <br>        <br>

<p><br /><br /><br />PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p><br />1.0. Introduction: The Marine Corps Regional Contracting Office (RCO) is procuring portable toilet rental and servicing on behalf of the Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Center (MCAGTFTC)/Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twentynine Palms, California.</p>
<p>2.0. Background: The MCAGTFTC/MCAGCC is a vast training center located in the lower Mojave Desert, approximately 70 miles north of Palms Springs. The installation is primarily utilized for desert war fighting training, and contains numerous ranges covering approximately 600,000 acres where military exercises are held. Some of the ranges are accessible by rough terrain, requiring the use of 4x4 vehicles. Some ranges are accessible by direct routes; however, if live-fire exercises are occurring, Range Control will close down the route and alternative routes with significantly longer travel times may be required.</p>
<p>2.1. The amount of usage varies with the size, number, and frequency of exercises. Historically, the larger exercises were called Mojave Viper (MV) and Enhanced Mojave Viper (EMV) exercises. These exercises consisted of training approximately 3000-6000 Marines on a monthly basis. These exercises were centered on training for Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF). A majority of the training was centered on close quarters training in a town like setting. As operations OIF and OEF are scaling down, the Marine Corps has transitioned to Integrated Training Exercises (ITX) and Large Scale Exercises (LSE). The historically high usage ranges have been phased out. Exercise transition to ITX and LSE consists of training approximately 6000-10,000 Marines. The ITX and LSE focus on the coordination of the entire MAGTF and will utilize more training space at MCAGCC.</p>
<p>2.2. There are over 900 miles of Main Surface Roads (MSR). The MSRs are not paved and sporadically maintained. Rain, Flash Floods and other Acts of God make some roads periodically impassable. Many of the roads lie in dry washes or cross dry washes. During periods of rain, the roads can be washed out to depths of 10 feet. In addition to the MSR, there are over 900 miles of trails that are not maintained and must be traversed utilizing 4 x 4 vehicles. The speed limit in all training areas is 25 miles per hour.</p>
<p>2.3. The base currently consists of three corridors. The west corridor begins just northwest of main side and continues north by northwest to the southwest of the Bullion Mountains running approximately from coordinates 84009100 up to 48004000. The delta corridor runs from the east of main side due north between the Bullion Mountains running approximately from coordinates 88008500 up to 88003100. The east corridor begins approximately from coordinate 97009575 due north up to 95752600. There is yet another corridor, currently unnamed, for which there will be future use that will run west to east from coordinate 36002700 to 10002700.</p>
<p>3.0. Scope of Work: The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, tools, materials, equipment, transportation, and other items necessary to provide the supplies/services required herein throughout the training ranges of MAGTFTC/MCAGCC with the exception of the Government Furnished Facilities, Equipment and Material listed in paragraph 5.4.

<p>5.2. Hours of Operation: Normal work hours are Sunday through Saturday 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM. However, due to operational commitments, additional toilets and/or hand wash&nbsp;stations&nbsp;and/or services may also be required after normal working hours and holidays.

<p>5.3. Providing and Servicing Portable Toilets.</p>
<p>5.3.1. General: The Contractor shall provide the required number of portable toilets that are specified in the attached spreadsheet. For the purpose of this contract, furnishing portable toilets shall coincide with the cleaning of the toilets, except for pick-up and delivery charges. The contractor may be required to divert long distances due to road closures caused by Range Control or as a result of flash floods and other adverse weather conditions. The government shall not be charged for aborted delivery or service attempts. The Contractor should anticipate an increase in usage on short notice among multiple ranges. This increase is known as "White Space" training. White space training is unplanned, unanticipated training that occurs with minimal lead time as a result of training ranges becoming available for use by unit commanders who decide to take advantage of the opportunity to expand their training experience aboard MAGTFTC/MCAGCC. The increase in usage may result in, but not limited to, changes from every other day service to everyday service or requests for additional toilets due to the highly diverse nature of the training conducted aboard MAGTFTC/MCAGCC. Contractors should note that historical usage has indicated White space CLINs may increase approximately 50% of "Known Training Locations" CLINs. The quantities listed on White Space CLINs 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007, and 1008 are estimates only.</p>

Collapsible and wood toilets and toilets with open grid flooring are NOT ACCEPTABLE. Contractor shall ensure that all portable toilets are staked or tied down to prevent spillage. Placement of sand bags, to include inside or on top of, securing the toilets is NOT ACCEPTABLE. Contractor shall ensure portable toilets are not placed within 20 feet of any storm channel or natural wash.</p>
<p>5.3.3. Delivery Requirements: The government will require the Contractor to deliver, locate, and service portable toilets in rough terrain or unpaved areas. Therefore, delivery to and servicing at these areas will require the Contractor to use heavy-duty four-wheel drive (4WD) vehicles.</p>
<p>5.3.4. Delivery Charges: Delivery and pick-up charges shall be a combined fee to include one servicing at the time of pick-up, and shall include all costs associated with delivery and pickup.

<p>5.3.7.1. Trash shall be removed by the contractor, placed in sealed trash bags and driven from the site to the nearest trash receptacle. Trash from sites other than MAGTFTC/MCAGCC shall not be placed in government trash receptacles. Excessive trash will be brought to the attention of the COR and/or the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>5.3.7.2. The contractor may reserve their obligation to service the unit(s) in question if servicing of the unit may be harmful to the operators (i.e. suspected ammunition in the portable toilet). The COR shall be notified immediately of such situations, and the contractor shall follow the COR's instructions.</p>
<p>5.3.7.3. Resupply toilets whenever serviced with adequate supplies to maintain the serviceability between servicing. A minimum of two (2) rolls of 2-ply toilet paper shall be placed in toilets, provide an odorless disinfectant and maintain fluid of between five (5) to seven (7) gallons.</p>

All dirt, mud, dust, markings, and graffiti shall be removed from the interior and exterior of the toilets. When it appears to the Contractor that damages to a unit is due to deliberate and extensive abuse by government personnel, the Contractor shall contact the COR to arrange a joint inspection prior to commencing repairs. The determination of the Contracting Officer (KO) concerning government responsibility is final and adverse determination shall not constitute grounds for contractor claim or equitable adjustment. Claims for excessive damages or total losses as a result of government action or inaction shall be treated as a contract claim and handled under the disputes clause.</p>
<p>5.3.9.1. Any required repairs or replacement of equipment, including but not limited to urinals, latches, hinges, toilet paper dispensers, and toilet seats shall be made when required. In the event the toilet is leaking, the toilet shall be removed from service immediately.</p>

Standard: Repairs or replacement of non-repairable/unserviceable units shall be made within twenty-four (24) hours of discovery by the Contractor's personnel or notification by the government.

Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports.<br />(b) must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S. for less than two years). <br />(c) will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III). If the background check is selected for verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database. NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at<br />Government expense.</p>
<p>Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshal's Office (PMO) of the Combat Center. For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).</p>
<p>3. Permanent Business Access: Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years. Submit all items listed above under "business access." NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense. Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractor's expense.</p>
<p>4. Emergency Access: Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities. The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.</p>
<p>5. Installation Access Badges: Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation. The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense. The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.</p>
<p>6. Denial of Access: The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission. In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access. Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract. Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:<br />a. is on the National Terrorist watch List.<br />b. is illegally present in the United States.<br />c. is subject to an outstanding warrant.<br />d. has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent information.<br />e. has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.</p>
<p>7. Employee Identification: Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>8. Employee Compliance. The Contractor's employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.</p>
<p>9. Contract Termination: The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, A SOLICATION, A REQUEST FOR QUOTES, OR AN INDICATION THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THE RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.<br /><br />This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI). This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.</p>
<p>1. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose:</span></strong> The purpose of this RFI is to gather comments and identify potential sources, materials, timeframe, and approximate costs to test, produce and implement anti-skid on 507 T-38 aircraft to increase braking capability. This is not to redesign the entire braking system, but to add anti-skid capability with minimal modification to the existing system.</p>
<p>2. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></strong> The T-38 System Program Office (SPO) requires an industry response regarding innovative or diverse technology to optimize the design for the braking system/landing gear. The current braking system lacks anti-skid braking capability. The T-38 is the only aircraft in the fleet without anti-skid, and has resulted in the loss of seven aircraft and two pilot fatalities. Numerous attempts have been made to evaluate existing materials and add anti-skid to the T-38. However, all attempts have been cancelled. The T-38 is still in need of improved stopping performance to increase safety during rollouts and rejected takeoffs. The T-38 program office is seeking cost-effective solutions to the issue.</p>
<p>3. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope of Task:</span></strong> <br /><br />&bull; Develop a new state of the art technology that will add an anti-skid capability to the T-38 while making minimal modifications to the existing landing gear system, hydraulics, valves, fluids, electronics, software, adapters, etc.<br />&bull; Anti-skid addition should match or improve stopping distance performance under every reasonable operating condition (wet/dry runway, heavy/light aircraft, etc.)<br />&bull; Anti-skid addition should not decrease current reliability/maintainability<br />&bull; Add no more than 25 lbs. in additional weight.<br />&bull; Materials must be manufactured in accordance with aviation industry standards, design specifications, requirements, and tolerances. <br />&bull; The contractor's response to the RFI should include estimates of increased performance <br />&bull; The contractors response should include proper schedule estimates, non-recurring costs, cost per unit, and costs to retrofit 507 A/C</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Information/Format:</strong></span> Potential offerors willing to become qualified source must be able to submit a Source Approval Request (SAR). Potential offerors shall provide information on relevant performance history and/or evidence of capability to satisfy this type of requirement, to include the NSN or PN (if existent). Potential offerors will demonstrate the offeror's infrastructure and integration capability to provide all aspects of this task to include but not limited to the following:<br /><br />&bull; Manufacturing aircraft components, specifically aircraft anti-skid<br />&bull; Previous government projects/qualification/approval/contract by similarity<br />&bull; Other pertinent data concerning your qualification to manufacture the required item.</p>
<p>Please submit electronically your response in an executive summary format not to exceed 10 pages. If your response includes information you consider proprietary, please mark the information in accordance with regulatory guidance. Please do not include company brochures or other marketing information.</p>
<p>Final vendor RFI responses are due by 11:59&nbsp;pm Mountain Standard Time on&nbsp;Wednesday 30&nbsp;April 2014.</p>
<p>The government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.</p>
<p>For questions, comments or RFI response, please contact:</p>

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION:  <br>    <br>  The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), in coordination with the Project Director Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (PD CHESS) is issuing this  Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information from industry regarding the ability to provide IT services on behalf of the Department of the Army. The estimated value of services within the scope of this RFI is $11B to $15B over a 5 year period of performance.  <br>    <br>  2. PURPOSE:  <br>    <br>  The intent of this RFI is to obtain information regarding the ability to provide IT services for a follow-on IT service contract to replace ITES-2S, on behalf of the Department of the Army. The US Army is seeking the following:  <br>    <br>    Information regarding industry interest and capabilities in participation in the concept described below, and <br>    <br>    Specific feedback and comments from industry regarding the grouping of the IT Services task areas in accordance with the attached questionnaire.    <br>    <br>  This is a Request for Information only. This RFI is being conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e). No contract will be awarded from this announcement and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in response to this RFI. As such, this RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute any obligation on the part of the US Army.  <br>    <br>  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or solicitation, should one be issued. All submissions become US Army property and will not be returned. All information received in response to this notice that is marked 'Proprietary' will be handled accordingly.  <br>    <br>  3. PROGRAM BACKGROUND:  <br>    <br>  The ITES-2S scope includes a full range of services and solutions necessary for the Army to satisfy its support of the Army enterprise infrastructure and infostructure goals with Information Technology (IT) services worldwide.  The scope includes the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) requirements as defined in Army Regulation 25-1 (AR 25-1).  ITES-2S are services-based solutions under which contractors may be required to provide a full range of IT equipment.  Therefore, end-to-end solutions to satisfy worldwide development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment requirements are included.  Additionally included is support to analyze requirements, develop and implement recommended solutions, and operate and maintain legacy systems, and equipment (The current ITES-2S Labor Categories are listed in Attachment 2).  It is the intention of the Government to establish a scope that is broad, sufficiently flexible to satisfy requirements that may change over the period of performance, and fully comprehensive so as to embrace the full complement of services that relate to IT.  The U.S. Army, Department of Defense, or any other Federal Agencies are authorized to fulfill requirements under ITES-2S. <br>   <br>  The Government has the requirement to provide IT services, as a follow-on to ITES-2S, to both the Army warfighter and civilians supporting the Army business operations, along with mission partners in modernizing and maintaining LandWarNet.  LandWarNet links the Army's forces around the world and provides on-the-move capability to maneuver forces while pushing access down to the lowest tactical level and from that foxhole back to their home station. <br>   <br>  Because of the depth and breadth of the services required to satisfy the IT requirement, the Government seeks information and advice on how to provide these services in a manner that will result in best value, for example, appropriately qualified personnel at a cost that provides value to both the Government and the customer and in a manner that is flexible to the vendor, e.g., multiple contracts that are narrower in scope. <br>   <br>  This is an RFI looking for innovative solutions in providing IT service contracts that will enhance the Army customer's (and possibly other DoD and federal agencies) ability to support their IT requirements.  The Government is looking for a way of purchasing services that could break out the services into different suites or catalogs in accordance with the new DoD Services taxonomy. <br>   <br>  4. TARGET AUDIENCE:  <br>    <br>  All sources, with the capability as described herein, are requested and encouraged to respond to this RFI.  <br>    <br>  5.

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION:   <br>      <br>   The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), in coordination with the Project Director Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (PD CHESS) is issuing this  Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information from industry regarding the ability to provide IT services on behalf of the Department of the Army. The estimated value of services within the scope of this RFI is $11B to $15B over a 5 year period of performance.   <br>      <br>   2. PURPOSE:   <br>      <br>   The intent of this RFI is to obtain information regarding the ability to provide IT services for a follow-on IT service contract to replace ITES-2S, on behalf of the Department of the Army. The US Army is seeking the following:   <br>      <br>     Information regarding industry interest and capabilities in participation in the concept described below, and  <br>      <br>     Specific feedback and comments from industry regarding the grouping of the IT Services task areas in accordance with the attached questionnaire.     <br>      <br>   This is a Request for Information only. This RFI is being conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e). No contract will be awarded from this announcement and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in response to this RFI. As such, this RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute any obligation on the part of the US Army.   <br>      <br>   Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or solicitation, should one be issued. All submissions become US Army property and will not be returned. All information received in response to this notice that is marked 'Proprietary' will be handled accordingly.   <br>      <br>   3. PROGRAM BACKGROUND:   <br>      <br>   The ITES-2S scope includes a full range of services and solutions necessary for the Army to satisfy its support of the Army enterprise infrastructure and infostructure goals with Information Technology (IT) services worldwide.  The scope includes the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) requirements as defined in Army Regulation 25-1 (AR 25-1).  ITES-2S are services-based solutions under which contractors may be required to provide a full range of IT equipment.  Therefore, end-to-end solutions to satisfy worldwide development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment requirements are included.  Additionally included is support to analyze requirements, develop and implement recommended solutions, and operate and maintain legacy systems, and equipment (The current ITES-2S Labor Categories are listed in Attachment 2).  It is the intention of the Government to establish a scope that is broad, sufficiently flexible to satisfy requirements that may change over the period of performance, and fully comprehensive so as to embrace the full complement of services that relate to IT.  The U.S. Army, Department of Defense, or any other Federal Agencies are authorized to fulfill requirements under ITES-2S.  <br>     <br>   The Government has the requirement to provide IT services, as a follow-on to ITES-2S, to both the Army warfighter and civilians supporting the Army business operations, along with mission partners in modernizing and maintaining LandWarNet.  LandWarNet links the Army's forces around the world and provides on-the-move capability to maneuver forces while pushing access down to the lowest tactical level and from that foxhole back to their home station.  <br>     <br>   Because of the depth and breadth of the services required to satisfy the IT requirement, the Government seeks information and advice on how to provide these services in a manner that will result in best value, for example, appropriately qualified personnel at a cost that provides value to both the Government and the customer and in a manner that is flexible to the vendor, e.g., multiple contracts that are narrower in scope.  <br>     <br>   This is an RFI looking for innovative solutions in providing IT service contracts that will enhance the Army customer's (and possibly other DoD and federal agencies) ability to support their IT requirements.  The Government is looking for a way of purchasing services that could break out the services into different suites or catalogs in accordance with the new DoD Services taxonomy.  <br>     <br>   4. TARGET AUDIENCE:   <br>      <br>   All sources, with the capability as described herein, are requested and encouraged to respond to this RFI.   <br>      <br>   5. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:   <br>      <br>   In an effort to gather information in a manner which can be analyzed, the US Army is requesting responses in three separate Sections (1) General Information; (2) Capability Questionnaire; and (3) General Feedback and Comments regarding the proposed concept and software products indicated (optional).   <br>      <br>   Instructions for Section 1: General Information   <br>      <br>   In order for a company's responses to Section 2 and Section 3 to be considered for the Government's analysis, the completion of Section 1, General Information, must be provided.   <br>      <br>   Instructions for Section 2: Questionnaire   <br>      <br>   The government is seeking comments from industry regarding the overall concept of the proposed ITES 3S contract.

<DESC>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS - 3 SERVICES (ITES-3S) <br> Request for Information <br>  <br> 1. DESCRIPTION: <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command, in conjunction with Project Director Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (PD CHESS) issued a Request for Information (RFI) on 7 Feb 13 to obtain information from industry regarding the ability to provide IT services on behalf of the Department of the Army. Based on results of information received the Government is considering several changes to the acquisition strategy for ITES-3S.  <br>  <br> The period of performance has been changed from a total performance of 5 years to a total performance of 9 years.  In order to incentivize performance the additional years are added to reflect the use of Award Term for additional option periods for the top performing prime contractors.   <br>  <br> The estimated value of services within the scope of this effort has changed from $11B - $15B to $20B - $25B.   <br>  <br> The NAICS code has been changed from 517110, Wired Telecommunications Carriers to 541519, Other Computer Related Services.  <br>  <br> There are several task areas listed below that were within scope of ITES-2S and could be utilized to create very specific task orders.  These types of task orders created the potential of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues under ITES-2S.  Under ITES-3S these task areas will be considered incidental to the actual service being performed and will not be utilized to create individual task orders.   <br>  <br> Program/Project Management <br> Strategic Enterprise IT Policy and Planning <br> Change Management <br> Program Assessments and Studies <br> IT Research and Development <br> IT Strategic Planning Program Assessment and Studies <br> IT Project Cost & Schedule Management <br> IT Strategic Planning   <br> Management/Administrative Support/Data Entry  <br> Independent Verification and Validation. <br>  <br> 2. PURPOSE: <br>  <br> The intent of this RFI is to: <br> 1)	Survey the marketplace to understand the number of businesses (large and small) that can accomplish these services as both prime or sub contractors, <br> 2)	Obtain industry suggestions for a more effective pricing methodologies at the basic contract level that will lead to enhanced competition at the task order level, <br> 3)	Obtain feedback on the use of Award Terms on the basic contracts,  <br> 4)	Additional feedback on task areas that are not being included in ITES-3S, <br> 5)	Identification of other vehicles that duplicate the ITES-3S vehicle,  <br> 6)	Identification of industry standards that shall be met by all contractors.  <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information only. This RFI is being conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.201(e). No contract will be awarded from this announcement and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in response to this RFI. As such, this RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute any obligation on the part of the US Army. <br>  <br> Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or solicitation, should one be issued. All submissions become US Army property and will not be returned. All information received in response to this notice that is marked 'Proprietary' will be handled accordingly. <br>  <br> 3. PROGRAM BACKGROUND: <br>  <br> The ITES-3S scope includes a full range of services and solutions necessary for the Army to satisfy its support of the Army enterprise infrastructure and infostructure goals with Information Technology (IT) services worldwide.  The scope includes the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Management (C4IM) requirements as defined in Army Regulation 25-1 (AR 25-1).  ITES-3S are services-based solutions under which contractors may be required to provide a full range of IT equipment.  Therefore, end-to-end solutions to satisfy worldwide development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and sustainment requirements are included.  Additionally included is support to analyze requirements, develop and implement recommended solutions, and operate and maintain legacy systems, and equipment.  It is the intention of the Government to establish a scope that is broad, sufficiently flexible to satisfy requirements that may change over the period of performance, and fully comprehensive so as to embrace the full complement of services that relate to IT.  The U.S. Army, Department of Defense, or any other Federal Agency are authorized to fulfill requirements under ITES-3S.  The task areas for ITES-3S are listed below. <br>  <br> 4.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Natick Contracting Division, in support of the Joint Program Executive Office - Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Program Manager - Guardian Product Manager - Force Protection Systems (PdM-FPS) has a need for Increment 3 of an Automated Installation Entry (AIE) System.   The objective of this acquisition is to provide Automated Installation Entry (AIE) hardware and software for up to 35 new installations.  AIE provides timely, effective and efficient threat detection necessary for Installation Commanders to assess and react in all threat environments.  AIE automates access control processes for authorized and registered personnel entering an installation.  AIE improves accuracy of access/denial and enables near real-time changes of authentication requirements in response to changes in force protection conditions.  The AIE acquisition will enhance installation security and improve both pedestrian and vehicle throughput at Access Control Points (ACP).  The third generation AIE System (AIE-3) will build on AIE-2 capabilities while meeting U.S. Army AIE Standards and Specifications dated 19 November 2007.  Additional capabilities will include biometric integration, extended sensor suites, enhanced automated processes and integration with the Joint Service architecture.  AIE-3 will be DIACAP accredited, net-ready and interoperable with legacy AIE systems and related base defense, force protection and physical security systems.  AIE-1 and AIE-2 installations may be retrofitted within the scope of this contract. <br>  <br> A Product Demonstration will be required for interested vendors. Information regarding Product Demonstration Procedures and Product Demonstration Evaluation Criteria will be released in the RFP. Vendors will be required to self nominate for participation in the Product Demonstration within two weeks of solicitation release in accordance with the RFP. The AIE-3 contract will be awarded using full and open competition with small business subcontracting requirements.  The Government will award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with a ceiling of $99M.  The POP will be four years (a two-year base and two one-year options). <br>  <br> A single Delivery Order (DO) will be awarded for each installation that includes site survey, site design, hardware and software acquisition and integration, fielding and CLS.  The DO will ensure the AIE-3 systems fielded across all installations are based on one integrated, Government-approved system configuration.   <br>

<DESC>This serves as a Notice of Intent issued via the Army Contracting Command (ACC), Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Research Triangle Park (RTP) Division in support of the United States Army Materiel Command, Army Research Laboratory (ARL). The intent of this action is to increase the overall contract ceiling under the ARL III Multiple Award (MA) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awarded on 30 November 2010 to the following seven (7) Contractors: Leidos (formerly known as Science Application International Corporation (SAIC) (W91CRB-11-D-0001), Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI) (W91CRB-11-D-0002), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) (W91CRB-11-D-0003), Exelis, Inc. (formerly known as ITT Corporation) (W91CRB-11-D-0004), Northrop Grumman (W91CRB-11-D-0005), Wintec Arrowmaker Incorporated (W91CRB-11-D-0006), and Technical and Project Engineering (TAPE) (W91CRB-11-D-0007) respectively.  <br>    <br> The ARL III MA contract currently has a contract ceiling of $480,000,000 over a five year ordering period. The contract currently has less than $18,000,000.00 of ceiling with 19 months remaining under the existing ordering period. The intent of this action is to increase the contract ceiling in order to allow adequate time for a follow-on contract to be competed without interrupting the agency's mission to support these activities. Based on the current schedule of the ARL III MA IDIQ, an increase of $150M is required. The Army is currently in the acquisition process to award a follow on contract as evidenced by the following activity on www.FBO.gov:   <br>    <br> 20 November 2013 - Issuance of Sources Sought W911NF-14-R-0003   <br>    <br> 03 February 2014 - Issuance of Special Notice W911NF-14-R-0003 advertising and inviting Industry to participate in Industry Day on 11 March 2014, to discuss the Advanced Expeditionary Warfare Development (AEWD) requirement which will replace the ARL III ID/IQ contract.    <br>    <br> 26 February 2014 - Issuance of Special Notice releasing Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) for Industry comment.  <br>  <br> 11 March 2014- Held Industry Day  <br>    <br> The Army intends to increase the MA IDIQ contract ceiling to $630M for the seven (7) ARL III Multiple Award contracts under the authority of Title 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The ARL III MA IDIQ contract vehicle utilizes Research and Development (R&D), Operations Maintenance and Administration (OMA) and Other Procurement Activity (OPA) to provide rapid response capabilities and support to special operations, stability operations, intelligence and irregular warfare.  <br>    <br> The base contract was issued on an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity basis in accordance with FAR 16.504. Task Orders are issued in accordance with FAR 16.505 entitled Ordering. The scope of the contract allows the contractor to furnish personnel, facilities, equipment and supplies to perform services including studies, technical investigations, research, development, experimentation, limited acquisition and logistics support for items and systems supporting upgrade and  <br> modernization of U.S. Army, United States Special Operations Command, other Government Agency and Department of Defense capabilities in expeditionary warfare, irregular warfare, special operations, and stabilization /reconstruction operations. The current global environment has stressed the need for these agile capabilities far beyond what has been experienced during the past management of this contract. Consequently, use of the contract has exceeded historical rates, which may lead to the ceiling being reached prior than the expiration of the contract period of performance of 30 November 2015. The additional ceiling amount of $150,000,000 is necessary to bridge the gap between reaching the contract ceiling and the award of a follow-on contract. This will prevent unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirements of those critical organizations and other units being supported by the Government through this contract.  <br>    <br> This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within 30 days after the publication date of this notice of contract action. All information received within the 30 days will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   <br>

<DESC>The FAA has a requirement for software that assists in the creation, maintenance and management of building and facility engineering drawings, models and data over a building or facilitys life cycle. The solution must include Computer Aided Design and Drafting (CADD), Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Electronic Drawing Management System (EDMS) software licenses and maintenance; training; documentation; programming; and consulting support as per the Draft Statement of Work (SOW) and specifications.  Therefore, the FAA is conducting this market survey to seek potential sources capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements.  Any vendor that believes it can provide these services is invited to submit a capability statement addressing its abilities to meet all of the requirements identified below and in the attached Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work.

This is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with a base period of performance of one (1) year and four (4), one (1) year option periods.

At this time, the nature of any procurement that may result from this market survey has not been determined.  The FAA may decide on a full and open competition or set aside all or part of an anticipated procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

PURPOSE:	
This market survey is designed to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

CAPABILITY STATEMENT:
All responders must provide a Capability Statement that addresses each of the following capabilities that are of concern to the FAA.  These topics are to be addressed in the order presented below:

a.Provide a brief description of your company's expertise and qualifications for providing the services requested.

b.Affirmatively identify potential solutions/capabilities that meet all of the draft SOW and specification requirements.

c.Identify products provided under previous industry and Government contracts that are similar in size, scope and complexity to this effort (including contract number and agency/organization).

d.Affirmatively state that your companys solutions/capabilities meet National Institute of Science & Technology (NIST) Security Certification Requirements.

REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST:
The FAA requires proof of documentation from interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and from eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Program.

In order to make this determination and to be considered responsive, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

a.Capability Statement (addressing the ability to meet all the requirements identified in the Market Survey - Draft Statement of Work)
b.Completed Business Declaration Form (attached)
c.Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form or proof of documentation from service-disabled veteran-owned small business (if applicable).

<DESC>***THE FULL SOLICITATION ESTIMATED ISSUE DATE Electronically in Federal Business Opportunities is April 25, 2014. *** The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, equipment, materials, transportation, supplies, (unless specified elsewhere as Government-furnished) and incidentals required for meadow maintenance and habitat restoration. <br />The intent of this project is to maintain and restore animal populations that need meadow habitat on the Central Coast Ranger District - Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. The primary focus of treatments is controlling unwanted vegetation in or adjacent to meadows. Unwanted vegetation includes but is not limited to non-native grasses, fern, blackberry, shrubs, and small trees. Portions of some meadows are steep and will require good traction to complete treatments.<br />Treatment methods vary depending on type of vegetation to be removed and the ability to access sites with machinery. Treatment methods can include machine mowing, machine mulching, and hand work. Machine mowing is generally used where machinery has access and the unwanted vegetation can be treated with a mower (grass and small shrubs, blackberry, trees, etc.). Mulching is used where machinery has access and unwanted vegetation is too large for mowing. Hand work with chainsaws, weed-eaters, etc. is used where machinery cannot access areas that need treatment.<br />The amount of effort needed to control unwanted vegetation varies by site. For this solicitation the government expects 258 acres of tractor mowing and 23 acres of mowing with tracks required on equipment. <br />The anticipated start work date is June 15, 2014 with completion by August 1, 2014. The project is 100% set aside for Small Business concerns. The NAICS code associated with this acquisition is 115310 and the small business size standard is $ 7 million average receipts over the past three years. For technical questions, contact Justin Gerding at 541-563-8422. Quotes are due by close of business on May 8, 2014.
<p>Note: Quoters shall register online at the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award and the registration must reflect an "Active" status. SAM shall be the portal to report biobased products utilized by the awardee of this project. Information on SAM may be obtained at the website: www.sam.gov. The awardee shall register at the website www.ipp.gov for the purposes of invoicing the government.</p>

Please see the attached Post-Industry Day Q&A. Please note that any further questions will not be answered until the solicitation is released.

Posted 26 March 2014:
The Industry Day Brief, Q&A and list of registered attendees (that permitted SSC Pacific to distribute their contact information) have been posted. While we estimate there were around 100 attendees, we only had 50 or so confirm their attendance at the Industry Day. Therefore, we have decided to publish the list of "registered attendees" as opposed to the list of actual attendees.

<a href="mailto:carole.householder@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Pittsburgh</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, has a project that involves the construction of the River Chamber Completion, Monoliths M-22 to M-27 at Charleroi Locks and Dam, Monongahela River, PA.  The major features of the requirement are identified below:    <br>        <br>  Construction of the River Chamber Completion, Monoliths M-22 to M-27, consists of building steel cofferboxes in order to construct the new reinforced concrete Middle Wall monoliths numbered M-22 to M-27, fabrication and installation of precast concrete culverts within the Middle Wall cofferboxes, relocating the electrical and dam control utilities from the lock side to the dam abutment side including construction of a new elevated platform supporting a new temporary electrical generator, areas of partial and complete removal of the existing river wall and fixed crest weir concrete sections using in-the-wet methods, modifying existing sheet pile structures, removal of a sheet pile structure, stabilization of existing lock walls, instrumentation installation, and instrumentation monitoring.  The work is to be performed using a combination of in-the-wet and in-the-dry construction methods.   The lock wall monoliths will be built using a combination of tremie concrete and cast-in-place concrete within a cofferbox.  The precast concrete culverts are three sided culverts and are to be fabricated off site at a commercial precast fabrication facility.  Onsite fabrication of the precast concrete culvert will not be permitted.  The M-22 to M-27 New Middle Wall section is approximately 260 feet by 35 feet in plan and is located riverward of the downstream end of the existing Middle Wall for the land lock chamber.  Construction of the lock wall involves underwater excavation of both soil and rock; heavy lifting and placement of the precast culverts from a floating plant; sheet piles, king piles and associated steel waler and strut installation for cofferbox construction from a floating plant; drilled shaft foundations; as well as operation and maintenance of the Government owned Concrete Batch Plant, concrete delivery system, and ancillary items.  Maintenance of the batch plant will include repair and/or replacement of various items necessary for continued operation of the plant.      <br>        <br>  Disposal of suitable excavated materials and concrete rubble without embedded ferrous material will be required.  The offloading area at Victory Hollow (VH), approximately 7 miles downstream of Charleroi Locks and Dam, will be utilized to stockpile and dispose of the suitable materials from the construction activities.  Ferrous and other construction waste material will be disposed at a commercially permitted facility licensed to accept the waste or recycled if applicable.    <br>        <br>  Construction work will occur in close proximity to waterway traffic.  The existing landside lock chamber is currently operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Maintaining unimpeded access (to the extent possible under this contract) of this facility to waterway traffic and maintaining stability of the existing middle wall are underlying goals of this contract.     <br>        <br>  Environmental protection will include requirements to remain in compliance with the existing NPDES permitting at both VH and the Concrete Batch Plant.    <br>        <br>  The magnitude of the project is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.  This procurement will be advertised on an Unrestricted basis.  The Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued approximately May 27, 2014 online only through the Federal Business Opportunities website; therefore, requests for hardcopies of the specifications and drawings will not be honored.      <br>        <br>        <br>

<DESC>The Sacramento District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has an upcoming acquisition to establish contracts to construct cutoff walls using the jet grout method along the waterside slope of the levee in Sacramento, California. <br /><br />Site R3A is located on the right bank of the American River at the Capitol City Freeway Bridge. The gap in the cutoff wall extends approximately 325 feet. The Capitol City Freeway crosses the levee in the north-south direction through the middle of the gap. Using jet grouting, the soil cement cutoff walls will be extended toward the Capitol City Freeway but not completely across the Freeway. The cutoff wall would be installed to within 10 feet of the edge of both sides of Capitol City Freeway, with approximately 88 feet on the upstream side of the freeway and approximately 83 feet on the downstream side. Extending the cutoff wall from the existing limits to within 10 feet of the edge of pavement would capture seepage in this area. <br /><br />Site L10 is located on the left/south bank of the American River at Howe Avenue. A 200-foot window at the site is proposed to be closed with approximately 345 linear feet of cutoff wall using the jet grout method along the waterside slope of the levee. The proposed cutoff walls will begin 15 feet before the end of the existing slurry cutoff wall, running parallel and adjacent to the existing walls for 25 feet. It will then turn at an angle and run down the waterside slope of the levees, then turn and continue parallel to and offset from the levee crown. It will turn at an angle to run up the waterside slope to the levee crown of the levee, and then turn and continue for an additional 24 feet parallel and adjacent to the existing slurry cutoff wall. After the jet grout cutoff wall is installed, a blanket of low permeability material will be placed on the waterside slope of the levee. The blanket will begin 10 feet beyond the cutoff wall centerline, and extend up the slope. Finally, the existing riprap slope protection will be removed and replaced after construction on the waterside slope under the bridges to prevent erosion. In addition, an approximately 175-foot section of the existing levee upstream of Howe Avenue will be raised by approximately 1 foot to provide required flood protection. <br /><br />The Contractor shall use a jet grouting system for constructing cutoff walls at both sites. The Contractor shall also be able to jet grout around existing utilities, to be protected in place. <br /><br />Acquisition Information: <br /><br />This acquisition is proceeding as a Request for Proposals (RFP) using the Trade-off Method. This RFP is a Competitive, Unrestricted Full and Open Competition and all businesses may respond. <br /><br />Estimated Cost Range is between $1,000,000 $5,000,000 <br /><br />Period of Performance for Construction: 120 Days. <br /><br />This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: Z2PZ, SIC CODE: 1629, NAICS Code: 238110. The size standard for this code is $14,000,000. All questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Marsha Sells, at (916) 557-5232, FAX: No.: (916) 557-5278, e-mail marsha.r.sells@usace.army.mil. <br /><br />Information about the time and location of the site visit/pre-proposal conference will be found in Section 00 21 00 of the solicitation. If you need assistance with downloading the plans or specs or registering as an Interested Vendor, please contact the Contract Specialist. <br /><br /><br />It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about September 30, 2013, for downloading at the Government's website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. No paper copies will be issued. <br /><br />The specific date and time will be identified in the solicitation. OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS. <br /><br />ORDERING SOLICITATION: Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy or CD-ROM format. The solicitation and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on a secure Government website known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) once the RFP is issued.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) performs annual maintenance dredging along the Sacramento and Stockton Deep Water Ship Channels (DWSCs).  The goal of the maintenance dredging project is to maintain the DWSCs to authorized depths which allows for the navigation of deep draft ship traffic.  The maintenance dredging activities also include disposal and discharge of dredged sediment into dredged material placement sites (DMPSs) and discharges of effluent from the DMPSs into surface water.  Per the General Order Waste Discharge Requirement Order (GO) No. 5-01-116 and R5-2004-0061-001, pre-dredge sampling, water quality monitoring, and effluent monitoring from DMPSs are required for the dredging operation.  This contract shall be to perform the pre-dredge sediment and water sample collection before dredging each year. <br> Shoaling identified by the USACE must be sampled and analyzed as part of the compliance with the GO for the maintenance dredging.  Each year the USACE prepares a Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) which is approved by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB).   <br>
