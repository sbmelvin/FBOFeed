<DESC>This is a Public Announcement; this is not a request for information, comment or quote.

The attached Statement of Work (SOW) defines the requirements for the Contractor to deliver Emergency Transceiver (ET) equipment in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ET Product Specification (FAA-E-7868) in Section J01.
 
The purpose of the ETR contract is to provide emergency air/ground communication capability for air traffic control (ATC) operations during catastrophic failure of the normal radio communication system. Communication failure might be experienced during loss of ATC facility power, or the failure of the inter/intra facility connectivity to the air/ground radio communications equipment.  ET also provides emergency radio communication when a facility must be abandoned, e.g., in the event of facility fire, bomb threat, or severe weather. The ET provides the air/ground communication capability during the first critical 60 minutes after these events occur. The ET will replace the existing grab-n-go Transceiver Communications Equipment (TCEs) at all Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs), Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), and Alaskan Flight Service Stations.

	Scope
The ETR contract scope encompasses all necessary equipment, software, documentation, and Contractor services required to replace existing emergency transceivers.  Contractor services include warranty and repair, contract and program management, configuration management, integrated logistics support, bar code and asset tracking, support of Government testing activities, development of maintenance/operator training, support of Government spares provisioning and maintenance program and other required services necessary for the implementation, maintenance, and operation of the emergency transceivers. 
 
The scope of the ID/IQ contract encompasses acquisition of future emergency communications equipment and/or services required during catastrophic failure of the normal radio communications systems or during emergency facility abandonment. Such additional equipment/services and their associated performance specifications would be determined as these requirements are identified. In addition, the ET equipment, software, and services may be ordered to support Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements, other FAA Program Offices, and other Government agencies, as needed.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>-</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The Pike-San Isabel NF has a requirement to collect and dispose of hazardous material left over from the abandoned Peekaboo Mine. The mine is approximately 8 miles up a high clearance 4WD road off High 82 before you go up to Independence Pass.  The site is near the road, but not directly accessible with a vehicle.  The containers of unknown substances must be packaged properly and carted over a temporary bridge back to the dirt road to be hauled out to the main road. This is not an easily accessible job, but it is a beautiful area and you will enjoy the scenery and your time on the Western Slope.  We estimate the magnitude of this project to be well less than $25,000.<br />-<br />A non-mandatory pre-bid site visit is tentatively scheduled for Oct 22 with more details to follow for those who express interest. You must bring your own high clearance vehicle or make your own plans to carpool with another contractor. A short wheel base is highly recommended. Don't forget your lunch, water and appropriate footwear.<br />-<br />Note: This project is currently unfunded and is subject to the availability of funding.  The Government is not responsible for the costs of your pre-bid site visit or of preparing a bid. In the event of no-award, the Government is not liable for your costs.<br />-<br /><strong>Contract Requirements</strong><br />-<br />1. Active Registration - www.sam.gov<br />2. Invoicing and Payment - www.ipp.gov - no payment without a disposal manifest.<br />3. Service Contract Act Wages - Chaffee County, CO<br />4. FAR Part 12 - Commercial Item<br />5.

Since the supplies are proprietary, there is only one supplier whose products can fit into the instrumentation; any other supply or service could cause the cancellation of the protocol/delays in completion of the protocol. Any deviation from the protocol must be reported to the FDA for non-compliance. Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLM) will telephone or e-mail request for reagents and supplies on a needed basis. Period of Performance shall be for a base year of twelve (12) months from date of award with four (4) one (1) year option periods.</p>
<p>The equipment and supply lists including quantities are attached to this notice and titled: Attachment 1 - List of Equipment and Attachment 2 - List of Supplies. The exact quantity of supplies cannot be estimated at the time of award, therefore an IDIQ contract type is most advantageous for this requirement.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted using policies unique to the contract authority of the test program for commercial items prescribed in FAR Subpart 13.5. <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 325413 with a large business standard size of 1,250 employees.<br />Interested concerns capable of providing the same or similar products or services as described in this notice may submit a capability statement outlining their capabilities.</p>

<DESC>A. This pilot study aims to provide a proof of concept to outline how computing power and data analysis tools could be used to support different aspects of strategic foresight analysis methodology. The deliverables of the SFA Pilot Study will be in two parts: First, a report on how political trends will evolve over the next two decades and shape the future security context; the second a report on the lessons learned using computing power in development of the SFA research, trend analysis and scenario development.<br /><br />B. NATO ACT will conduct a pilot study by incorporating computing<br />power and tools in the research, trend analysis and scenario<br />development parts of its methodology in the development of SFA<br />reports. This pilot study encompasses three different but<br />interrelated tasks:<br /><br />1. Task 1: Research/Large Data Ingest Tool(s): Contractor is expected to reach out and access different web pages and other data sources that are identified by the requirements holder. Should contractor identify any additional data sources, those will be coordinated with the requirements holder. The use of commercial sources of information will be coordinated with the requirements holder to avoid duplicate<br />payments. Data sources will be aligned with the SFA themes: Political-Human-Technology-Economics/Resources -Environment.<br />Contractor will use a much larger data set and data analytics to extract data from multiple sources. In this context, a wide variety of reports and media/social media sources will be included. Crowd sourcing techniques will also be used as part of data collection and verification. The tool(s) should enable machine learning as data collection continues. The contractor will be responsible for the storage of the collected data. This data will not be shared with any other entity without authorization of the HQ SACT.<br /><br />The data derived from multiple sources as an outcome of search will be stored, indexed, cleaned and be ready for further analysis. Data will categorised and classified to allow the analyst access without any restrictions. The data will be structured in a common and usable format. It must also be possible to reliably automate structuring and formating conversions. The origin and source of the data should be available to COTR to make sure sources are known so that credibility and reliability can be evaluated. The contractor will provide insights on how data is collected, categorised, cleaned, verified and validated.<br /><br />2. Task 2: Trend Analysis Tool(s): The contractor will use prepared data to further analyse trends, cause and effect relations and cluster trends to reduce the number of trends to a comprehensible level by the analysts. In order to analyse trends, contractor will install/allow use of tool(s). Contractor will provide descriptive analytic tools, such as mind maps, to visualize the data and provide insights on the evolution and trajectory of the trends. Contractor will also provide tools for trend management and support for development of the reports that will provide insights on the trends and their associated implications.<br /><br />3. Task 3. Scenario Development Tool(s): Based on the outcome of research, Contractor will provide a scenario development tool(s) that will be used to gain further insights, inform and/or validate trends and implications. The scenario tool(s) should allow &lsquo;what if' analysis for exploration of certain hypotheses. As a result, scenario analysis tool(s) will increase the ability to provide in-depth analysis of different situations and to identify indicators, trends and associated defence and security implications.Please read entire Notice of Intent for requirement.<br /><br />Issue Date: 13 November 2018, (target date)<br />Bid Closing Date: 03 January 2019, (target date)<br /><br />Type of Contract: Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Deliverables Contract.<br />Period of Performance: 20 January 2019 (Estimated) - 31 October 2019 (Estimated)<br /><br />

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Point of Service (VPS), Office of Veterans Access to Care provides Veterans with convenient control of their own health information, while streamlining and standardizing basic patient-facing activities at VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) nationwide.  VPS devices enable Veterans to make better use of their wait time at VA locations to update demographic important information and fill out clinical questionnaires to ensure pertinent information is shared with their care providers.  VPS has completed national deployment of approximately 4,846 freestanding, 1,024 desktop, and 482 wall mounted VetLink devices (kiosks) to the 161 VAMCs and their CBOCs.  Performance Management and Control (PM&C) support provides the tools and services to monitor and improve VetLink performance across VA healthcare system today.  PM&C begins after the initial deployment of a VetLink system in a VAMC or CBOC.  There are many factors unique to this stage of a VetLink deployment in VA.  A typical VetLink deployment modifies the workflows of potentially hundreds of VA employees, and thousands of Veteran patients within each facility.  Configuration, training, hardware placement, local workflows/policies, and experience levels of the administrators and end users can all contribute to performance below expected levels.  The PM&C team engages with sites after activation and provides subject matter expert support to help site leads develop the experience and expertise to manage VetLink system performance.  In addition, thermal paper replacement is required for all deployed kiosks to enable full utilization of the kiosks as they print out the Veterans  appointment information, customer surveys, etc.  The anticipated period of performance is six months from date of award with three, 12-month options and an additional six-month option, for a total of 48 months.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />Forest Service CIO COM/LOS Radio Group
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The United States Forest Service (USFS) is seeking information from manufacturers who make radio dispatch console solutions capable of meeting the current and projected needs of the Forest Service using the new NIST IPv6 standards for increased security of the FS networks.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  IAW FAR 15.209(c) (Federal Acquisition Regulation), the following Provision is included in this RFI, FAR 52.215-3, (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying sources of radio dispatch solutions that will meet NIST standards required to operate securely on the FS Network.</p>
<p>1.3 This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quote (RFQ) or a promise to issue an RFP or RFQ in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, USFS is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or RFQ, if any is issued.</p>
<p>1.4 Response to this RFI are limited to manufacturers of hardware or software which comprise a substantial and necessary component of the requested solution.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The US Forest Service operates a system of radio networks across the nation which provide communications to support administrative, project, incident, safety and emergency work of the Agency and its partners.  Permanent agency-owned radio systems are in operation on each National Forest and Grassland and are controlled by interagency dispatch centers serving one or more Forests or Grasslands as well as land areas managed by partner agencies, both federal and non-federal.  The Forest Service maintains all agency-owned radio equipment, including dispatch equipment, through their Land Mobile Radio group comprised of Government employees with a small amount of contracted support.</p>
<p>Interagency dispatch centers use purpose-build solutions and equipment to control remote RF control stations (base stations).  Currently, the Forest Service uses both hardware-based and IP-based dispatch solutions.  Base stations are located at both office and mountaintop sites and will generally control two or more repeater stations.  The connectivity between the dispatch center and the base stations may be comprised of any combination of 2/4 wire agency-owned copper, 2/4 wire leased lines, telco T1 circuits, microwave links, UHF links, HF links, or IP network.  The current radio networks are analog, conventional systems with plans to migrate to phase 1, APCO Project 25.  Field radios, both handheld and mobile, are VHF.  The current primary method of control is via in-band signaling using tones for base station channel control, shown in Figure 1:<br /> <br />Figure 1: In-band signaling (See attached "RFI Figure 1" for diagram page2)</p>
<p><br />To transition into and out of IP networks, radio gateway devices are used either for re-creation of analog 2/4 wire signaling, or, for direct control of base stations with discrete connections for audio, PTT, COR, monitor, and channel control.  Radio gateways may be located at dispatch centers, office locations, or remote radio sites with no environmental control (HVAC) or commercial power.  Tone remotes and IP remotes are used at staffed office locations to allow Forest Service employees transmit and receive capability of select radio channels.</p>
<p>New and emerging requirements, business practices, and standards have brought about a need for the Forest Service to evaluate the commercial marketplace for solutions to meet current and expected (future) radio dispatch and control solutions.  It is the intent of this RFI to assess solutions, architecture, capabilities, risks, limitations, assumptions and costs of purpose-built radio dispatch solutions.  The results of this RFI will be used to aid in the development of a set of technical and operation dispatch and control requirements which provide core functionality, allow for future growth, and allow for a best-value investment by the agency.</p>
<p>3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>In order to limit multiple submissions of the same solution, responses to this RFI are limited to original equipment manufacturers (OEM) only.  Integrators, resellers, installers, or other 3rd parties are encouraged to work with manufacturers in the development of any submission.  Please refer to section 1.2 for clarity.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI are requested to be in Microsoft Word format supplemented, as necessary, with other information at the discretion of the vendor.  Responses may address any or all of the requested information.  The use of direct hyperlinks within submittals is encouraged.</p>
<p>Vendors are requested to provide information about solutions which are purpose-built for radio dispatch control and which, in the vendor's opinion, are capable of providing a robust, professional, and supportable solution for the next 8 to 12 years.  The following sections identify areas in which more pointed information is requested and responses to these would be supplemental.  Please refer to the Section number in responses.  Vendors may also submit additional, pertinent, information, as desired, for clarity purposes or to provide additional information relevant to their solution.</p>
<p>3.1 Ability to support current operations<br />Predominately the Forest Service operates conventional, analog VHF radio systems employing in-band signaling for radio control (see Figure 1).

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT - THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) PART 10, MARKET RESEARCH. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), and nothing shall be construed here or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the Government to further action because of this RFI. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. The Government is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. There is no solicitation available and requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.
<p><br />This notice is intended as market research to determine the availability and capability of potential sources for the services described here and to assist in determining an acquisition strategy. Any information submitted by respondents to this notice is strictly voluntary. The Government does not intend to make an award based on responses to this notice.</p>
<p>Contractors responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information. The information collected through this process is market research as described by FAR 2.101 and in accordance with FAR 10.002. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>
<p>Note the following information is provided for INFORMATIONAL purposes only.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is issuing this notice on behalf of the Foreign Payment Practice within the Large Business &amp; International (LB&amp;I) Division as a means of conducting market research to identify the availability of a software program that reviews data intended to be reported on an IRS Form 1042-S (Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding) and identifies data that is inconsistent, or potentially inconsistent, with the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p>In general, Withholding Agents must file an information return on Form 1042-S to report amounts paid from U.S. sources to foreign persons. A Withholding Agent is any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, or custody of amounts that are subject to the rules under Chapter 3 or Chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code. Based on 2016 numbers, approximately 3,500 withholding agents filed over 90% of the Forms 1042-S received by the IRS.</p>
<p>The Form 1042-S collects a variety of codes and information to help the IRS determine whether the correct amount has been withheld under the law. The IRS Foreign Payment Practice would like to identify the availability of a software program that Withholding Agents could use to review Form 1042-S electronic data before submitting it to the IRS. The program would produce reports listing identifiable reporting errors and potential errors. See Attachment 1 for examples of such reports.</p>
<p>Depending upon the availability, cost, and capabilities of the program, the IRS would consider use of the program when conducting compliance examinations. Use of the program by Withholding Agents as part of their due diligence could be be considered a mitigating factor in penalty determinations.</p>
<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION - Vendors who believe they can provide such a program to Withholding Agents should respond by indicating their interest and providing sufficient information to demonstrate a capability to provide the program. Responses should include a capability statement as well as a summary of the firm's experience providing this type of service. The information should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirement by providing clear and comprehensive information supporting the company's qualifications. <br />In addition to demonstrating your capability, each response must also include the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Company Name, Address, CAGE Code and DUNS Number</p>
<p>(2) Point of Contact Name, Telephone Number and E-mail Address</p>
<p>(3) Information Regarding Existing Government Purchasing Vehicles - Vendors should list any existing Government purchasing vehicles they hold that could be applicable to this requirement (e.g. GSA Schedule Contracts, Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), etc.). Vendors should provide the name of the vehicle (NASA SEWP, NITAAC CIO, VETS 2, Alliant/Alliant SB, GSA Schedule 70, etc.), a brief overview of the scope and their contract number.</p>
<p>(5) Pricing and Associated Costs (FOR BUDGETING PURPOSES ONLY) - Provide a general overall price range for these services and/or supplies based on your offering and identify main cost drivers, or the biggest expenses for providing these types of services and/or supplies?</p>
<p>(4) Questions/Comments - Vendors may include questions, comments or other feedback regarding this RFI and the content of Attachment #1 in their responses. The IRS is not obligated to provide responses or update this RFI in any manner however vendor feedback may be of assistance in refining any future requirements and determining an acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>RESPONSES - Responses to this notice shall be submitted electronically to Sandra.R.Anderson@irs.gov no later than 4:00 pm, Friday, July 27, 2018 EST. Responses shall not exceed 10 pages and shall not contain any brochures, advertising or any other type of extraneous, graphic literature or documents that have not been requested and are not relevant or essential in demonstrating the company's ability to provide the required services. Vendors may provide links to relevant websites, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Vendors may submit questions regarding this notice however, the IRS does not guarantee that any responses will be provided. Questions shall be submitted by e-mail. Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The Government shall not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with all applicable Government regulations. All documentation shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>Vendors shall use the reference number IRS-1042-S Data Integrity Program-2018 in the subject line of their response as well as in the subject line of any other e-mail correspondence referencing this notice.</p>

<DESC>This RFI is issued for market research purposes only. The purpose of this notice is twofold:<br /><br />1.	Identify U.S. small business concerns having an interest in and capability to provide support for INL/WHP programs. Responses to this notice will be considered in selecting the acquisition strategy and to determine the appropriateness of setting aside Functional Areas (FAs) of the IDIQ for any one of the small business programs described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19.<br /><br />2.	Obtain industry feedback on the proposed acquisition strategy to include, but not limited to: IDIQ contract ceiling, composition of FAs, proposed number of awards per FA, and existing contract vehicles that the Department may leverage to meet INL/WHP requirements.<br /><br />All information contained in this notice is preliminary in nature and is subject to change. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Request for Quotations (RFQ), Invitation for Bids (IFB), or a commitment on the part of the government to conduct a solicitation in the future. All information provided is strictly voluntary and no reimbursement will be made by the Government for any costs associated with providing a response to this notice or otherwise participating in market research activities. Further, the US Department of State offers no assurance that a solicitation will result from this notice.<br /><br />Any information submitted will become the property of the Government and will not be returned. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and must be clearly marked.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND</span></strong>
<p>The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) leads the Department of State's anticrime and counter-narcotics efforts. INL assistance programs help partner nations to build their capacities to extend the reach of justice under the rule of law, including respect for human rights and gender equality, and to deny safe haven to criminals who would otherwise operate with near impunity.<br /><br />INL delivers technical assistance and capacity to: enhance international drug control through interdiction and supply reduction; develop civilian law enforcement capacity, regional partnerships, and information sharing; and further the administration of justice and corrections under the rule of law with respect for human rights. INL's programs seek to oppose and counter illicit drug production and demand; drug, wildlife and human trafficking; corruption; cybercrime; intellectual property rights (IPR) fraud; transnational organized crime; environmental crime; crimes that threaten civilian security; crimes against women; and activities using the proceeds of crime.</p>
<p><br />INL's anticrime programs seek to improve and support key components of the criminal justice system such as gendarmerie, police, customs and border officials, investigators, judges, courts, prosecutors, defense attorneys, civil society organizations, and the corrections system. INL also plays a significant role in front line U.S. foreign policy priority countries in transition by assisting in strengthening internal security and governance under the rule of law.</p>
<p><br />The nimble, fluid nature of international crime needs to be addressed through a variety of tools, both programmatic and diplomatic. Criminal networks are constantly evolving and changing their activities in response to operational threats. New competitors enter the crime market with different ideas and ways of operating as others are arrested, neutralized, or removed. As the law enforcement communities' anti-crime techniques improve, criminals evolve their techniques to make use of new technologies and alter and expand their modes of criminality, especially in the commission of cybercrime, financial crime, and the smuggling of drugs, weapons and humans. Often, a lack of sufficient and appropriate resources, combined with host governments' limited infrastructure and capacity to support and maintain the newest technological advancements and equipment, severely hinder the ability to immediately and effectively counter criminal networks.</p>
<p><br />The threats and challenges INL faces are often regional, and therefore, the solutions should be regional. Many of the challenges and criminal networks faced by INL and its partners in the Western Hemisphere are interrelated and similar in nature. Additionally, many INL partners in the region share a common language, possess a similar culture, and face similar constraints in meeting the aforementioned challenges. Moreover, historically there has been a high degree of cooperation between INL programs in the region.</p>
<p><br />In order to meet its objectives, INL/WHP requires flexible and timely acquisition support. This proposed multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract aims to establish a streamlined approach to successfully meeting INL/WHP's acquisition requirements, while maintaining the public's trust and fulfilling public policy objectives.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROPOSED CONTRACT STRUCTURE</span></strong></p>
<p><br />The Department aims to establish approximately three (3) IDIQ contracts per each of the following FAs. The cumulative program ceiling is expected to be approximately $500 million for the 66-month effective period of the contracts (5-year base plus a 6-month option).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull;	FA 1: Training Services<br />&bull;	FA 2: IT Services<br />&bull;	FA 3: IT and Communications Systems<br />&bull;	FA 4: Operations, Logistics, and Facilities Support Services<br />&bull;	FA 5: Forensics and Non-Intrusive Inspection Equipment<br />&bull;	FA 6: Vehicles<br />&bull;	FA 7: Watercraft<br /><br />The FAs were selected to comply with the requirements of 13 CFR &sect;121.402(c). While we acknowledge certain overlap between the FAs, each order awarded under the IDIQ contracts will be assigned the single NAICS code that best describes the principal purpose of the goods or services to be acquired. This NAICS code selection will determine under which FA the order will be awarded. Only companies awarded an IDIQ contract under that FA will be eligible for award. Companies may participate and be awarded contracts under more than one FA.</p>
<p><br />Refer to Appendix A for a list of proposed FAs, associated NAICS codes, small business size standards, and examples of task required under each FA.</p>
<p><br />Companies may be required to provide services in the language of the INL partner nation. Additionally, all products may require local warranty, maintenance, and support. The use of simultaneous translators and/or US-based warranty and technical services may not meet INL/WHP requirements.</p>
<p><br />While we acknowledge there are multiple companies with generic capabilities under each FA, we are particularly interested in companies having said capabilities <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span></strong> implementation experience in programs similar to INL/WHP programs.<br /><br />Work under the IDIQs will require performance overseas. Additionally, performance may be required in remote and non-permissive locations. USG logistical and other support will be kept to a minimum.<br /><br />Given the nature of the required work, the Department reserves the right to require offerors to possess a facility security clearance and its personnel to possess a security clearance (American Citizen and Third Country Nationals) or a Regional Security Office (RSO) background investigation (Local Nationals).<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NON-MANUFACTURER RULE (NMR)<br /></span></strong><br />For those FAs for which a manufacturing NAICS code has been assigned small business are reminded that, unless the SBA has granted a class waiver of the NMR for the particular product, the company will be required to be either the manufacturer of the products offered or qualify for the procurement as a "nonmanufacturer".</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 19.102(f), the applicable size standard for a "nonmanufacturer" is 500 employees.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSE</span></strong></p>
<p><br />Prospective offerors interested in responding to this notice should submit information electronically to Weakley-LugoKF@state.gov and FernandezJM@state.gov no later than April 4, 2018 at 10:00 am EST.</p>
<p><br />The Government will only consider responses submitted in the Appendix B format. Given the interest expected, the required format is required to facilitate with the efficient analysis of responses. Responses providing partial information may not be considered by the Government.</p>
<p><br />Telephone inquiries will not be accepted nor acknowledged. Questions, if any, must be directed via email to Weakley-LugoKF@state.gov and FernandezJM@state.gov.</p>
<p><br />Individual feedback or evaluations will be not be provided to companies regarding their submissions.</p>
<p><br />The Government reverses the right to conduct one-on-one interviews with any of the respondents to this notice. Depending on the number of responses received one-on-one interviews may not be conducted with each respondent.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />W912DQ-18-SS-1012<br />Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought <br />For Kansas City Levee Pump Station Construction Contracts <br />For the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, issued in accordance with DFARS 236.272 and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Acquisition Instruction (UAI) 5236.272. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests.</p>
<p>The USACE Kansas City District (NWK) is engaged in on-going efforts to plan a variety of levee infrastructure improvements within the Kansas City area for earliest possible implementation. The Kansas City Levee program emphasizes fast and effective delivery of infrastructure supporting levee improvements. NWK is seeking capable contract support with interest in future delivery of Design-Build efforts to be performed on the pump stations such as but not limited to Argentine, Armourdale, and Central Industrial District pump stations in the Kansas City area. The Design-Build contracts will be to either construct new flood pump stations replacing old facilities, and/or improve/alter existing flood pump stations. Work is integral to urban levee systems near the Kansas and Missouri Rivers and may be expected to include temporary flood protection, continuous operation of existing facilities during construction, and control of surface and ground water. This mission requires an urgent response including an application of diverse resources to ensure all necessary issues are addressed during design, real estate acquisition, and contract procurement.</p>
<p>The near-term strategy is to the establish two Prequalified Sources Lists (PSL) to address FY19-FY22 urgent and complex priorities to the USACE Kansas City District designated pump stations along but not limited to the Argentine, Armourdale, and Central Industrial District levee units. One PSL will be for unrestricted business concerns and one list will be small business concerns. The Prequalification Procedures described below reflects the process by which the PSL will be established and admit new contractors over time while this need for prequalification as described exists.</p>
<p>The PSL will be available for use while other acquisitions are underway for similar requirements. The PSL will be reviewed annually to ensure a legitimate need exists. Presently, the Government anticipates a target of three contract actions over the next four years. As such, it is likely that a legitimate need will continue for the next 48 months. The PSL will be used as a vehicle to solicit several stand-alone "C" type Design Build construction contracts. After the PSL is established, the Government intends to proceed by issuing solicitations using FAR Part 14 procedures (i.e., Invitation for Bid (IFB)). However, the Government reserves the right to issue solicitations using FAR Part 15 (i.e., Contracting by Negotiation (i.e., Best Value using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable up to and potentially including Trade-Off)) when determined to be in the Government's best interest.</p>
<p>The KC Pump Station projects that are likely to be constructed under stand-alone contracts that will be advertised to the firms on the PSL to include replacement and/or modification of existing pump stations (in accordance with EM 1110-2-3102 General Principles of Pumping Station Design and Layout, EM 1110-2-3104 Structural and Architectural Design of Pumping Stations, EM 1110-2-3105 Mechanical and Electrical Design of Pumping Stations, EM 1110-2-1913 Design and Construction of Levees, and EM 1110-2-2902 Conduits Culverts and Pipes), implementation of pressure relief well systems, in-situ pipe rehabilitation, construction of structural and/or earthen cofferdams, and access to construction areas by land and/or barge operations. Projects will be located within the Kansas City District with a particular focus on Pump Station Replacement, Refurbishment, or Upgrades.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for procurements offered to firms on the Prequalified Sources list is NAICS Code 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, which has a small business size standard of $36.5M.<br />To be considered qualified for the PSL, firms must meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>1. Bonding Capability: Single bonding capability of at least $30M and the firm must state their total aggregate bonding capability. A letter from your surety will be required to verify the firms bonding capabilities. Notice to Proceed (NTP), will not be issued until after the successful bidder or offeror provides sufficient bonding to cover the work required as communicated under the project solicitation.</p>
<p>2. Capacity: Capability to perform at least one $30M and two $20M construction contracts concurrently.</p>
<p>3. Real Estate: Must have capability to facilitate the process of real estate acquisition with interest in relevant experience with railroad coordination.</p>
<p>4. Experience: Completed at least one levee pump station design and construction contracts near large rivers in the United States with individual contract prices of $10M or more within the last ten years. Include identification of the project and a brief description. Identify any design and construction contracts that included construction work adjacent to or conflicting with operational railroads.</p>
<p>5. Past Performance: Offerors will need to provide relevant past performance information for the projects used to demonstrate previous experience. The past performance information needs to convey how work was executed in an environment requiring continuous operation of facilities during construction and control of surface and ground water. Past performance needs to include how the following technical disciplines were utilized: Civil design, structural engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, geotechnical engineering, and real estate specialists. The Government may review past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture or teaming arrangement) identified in the offeror's responses, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS) for large business, small business must submit their subcontracting participation plan with supporting documentation that they met the goals, and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>6. Schedule Performance: Offerors will need to demonstrate their capability to meet schedule commitments on relevant past work.</p>
<p>7. An accounting system that can support Fixed-Price Economic Price Adjustment (FPEPA) and Fixed-Price Incentive Firm Target (FPIF) contracts.</p>
<p>8. Ability to successfully comply with the provisions of FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns.</p>
<p>9. Certification that all responses to this Prequalification of Sources sources-sought notice are accurate and complete by a principal of the firm.</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement shall contain:</p>

All firms must address items 1-9 in their response. Please note, that the minimum standards may not be limited to the items listed. <br /><br />A target of five large business contractors will be placed on a PSL and five small business contractors will be placed on a PSL. Each action will be determined which PSL will be the most advantageous to the Government and contractors will receive fair opportunity to compete for each action advertised to the firms on the Prequalified of Sources List.</p>
<p>2. Completed Prequalification of Sources Capabilities Statement clearly demonstrating how the firm meets the minimum qualification requirements contained herein. This submission must be signed by a principal of the firm to be considered valid. Submissions with electronic signatures are acceptable and have the full force and effect of ink signatures.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION; not a pre-solicitation notice or solicitation for proposals/quotations. Pursuant to FAR Part 10 (Market Research), the purpose of this notice is to: (1) determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exist other than L-3 Henschel, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of TANOnet proprietary system; (2) determine if commercial items suitable to meet the agency's needs are available, or could be modified to meet the agency's requirements; and (3) determine the commercial practices of companies engaged in providing the needed service or supply. Pursuant to FAR Part 6 and FAR Part 19, sole source, competition and set-aside decisions may be based on the results of this market research. This notice in no way obligates the Government to any further action.
<p>REQUIREMENT: This Notice is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG), Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC) Oakland, CA, to identify sources capable of providing all management, supervision, personnel, labor, materials, and equipment to upgrade 175' WLM Machinery Plant Control &amp; Monitoring System (MPCMS) installed on the U.S. Coast Guard Coastal Buoy Tenders (WLM class) in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW). The existing MPCMS installed on the 175' WLM class utilizes two Versa Module Europa (VME) computers. Several printed circuit boards installed in the VME card cage chassis contain components which are no longer manufactured and residual stocks of fully functional cards are dwindling.</p>
<p>As a result, the scope of this effort includes all tasks to remove, modify, install, test, calibrate, and certify equipment, as well as the development of training material and the teaching of classes to cutter personnel, support staff, and instructors.</p>
<p>The intent of this upgrade is to replace the existing VME hardware and data logger with modern redundant processors that will interface with the existing remote terminal units (RTU) and other components of the legacy system. Interested vendors must have access to TANOnet source code in order to facilitate the upgrade. Interested vendors shall be registered in SAM under NAICS 334513.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. No solicitation will be issued. A determination not compete this proposed contract based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO CONDUCT: National Cyber Range Complex (NCRC) Event Planning, Operations, and Support (NCRC EPOS) Industry Day and Release of Draft Documents
<p><br />This Special Notice W900KK-19-R-0011 is associated with previous announcements under Special Notice W900KK-17-NCR, Pre-solicitation Notice W900KK-17-NCRC, and Sources Sought Notice W900KK-18-R-0011 with amendments. All future announcements pertaining to the NCRC EPOS requirement shall be posted to FedBizOpps under Solicitation Number W900KK-19-R-0011.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is seeking industry participation for a multi-year National Cyber Range Complex (NCRC) Event Planning, Operations, and Support (EPOS) contract to support the mission of providing realistic cybersecurity environments to support Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) of major Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs and to enable the conduct of realistic training and certification events for the DoD Cyber Mission Force (CMF).</p>
<p>NOTE: This effort is separate and distinct from activities related to the development and acquisition of capabilities to support the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The mission of the National Cyber Range Complex (NCRC) is to improve the resiliency and lethality of the nation's warfighters in the cyber-contested battlespace by delivering operationally representative cyberspace environments for T&amp;E, training, and mission rehearsal. The NCRC team supports DoD acquisition program managers in the planning and execution of a wide range of cybersecurity activities throughout the lifecycle, including science and technology experimentation, architectural evaluations, security control assessments, cooperative vulnerability and penetration assessments, and adversarial assessments. As well, the NCRC supports training, certification, and mission rehearsal requirements for the Cyber Mission Force (CMF).</p>
<p>Driven by the rapidly increasing demands for cyberspace T&amp;E, training, and mission rehearsal across the DoD, TRMC is leading the expansion of the capacity and capabilities of the NCRC. In addition to the existing elements of the NCRC, new NCRC sites will be established within government-controlled facilities at the following locations: Orlando, FL, Charleston, SC, Patuxent River, MD and Fort Walton Beach, FL. In the future, additional NCRC facilities may be established in order to meet emerging DoD requirements. At maturity, the NCRC will consist of an integrated and interoperable federation of facilities designed to enable the planning and execution of very large-scale, complex, distributed cybersecurity T&amp;E and training events.</p>
<p>THIS EFFORT IS FOR THE CYBER EVENT PLANNING AND OPERATIONS SUPPORT AT GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED NCRC FACILITIES AT THE PRE-SELECTED LOCATIONS LISTED ABOVE. IT IS NOT FOR THE DESIGN AND BUILDOUT OF THE ACTUAL FACILITIES OR THE DESIGN AND BUILDOUT OF THE CORE NCRC INFRASTRUCTURE CAPABILITIES.</p>
<p>INDUSTRY DAY:</p>
<p>In partnership with TRMC, the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Orlando (ACC-ORL) and the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation's (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets, Threat Simulators and Special Operations Forces Training Systems (STS) (PM ITTS) are hosting an NCRC EPOS Industry Day and a site visit/tour of the National Cyber Range (NCR) on 27 November 2018.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Plasma-Therm, LLC. for the procurement of gas system upgrades for NIST's existing Plasma-Therm reactive ion etch and high density chemical vapor deposition system.
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The CNST NanoFab has a need to update the gas panel on three existing Plasma-Therm systems. The current systems were equipped with a limited number of gas lines. In recent years, the number of research projects in NanoFab has grown dramatically, more process capabilities are being required. Adding an additional gas line to the system will bring more users and develop more processes on the system with a cost far less than full system replacement.</p>
<p>Currently, users require NanoFab to have additional gas channels on our Plasma-Therm systems to support ongoing research efforts. To add this new process control capability, one more gas line is required for each of the systems.</p>
<p>The Plasma-Therm systems operate with a proprietary control system that is not available from any other source. Which makes Plasma-Therm uniquely qualified to fulfill this current need. Adding a new gas line into the system shall require access the existing proprietary control scheme. No other control system can be substituted.</p>
<p>Plasma-Therm, has the responsibility of maintaining these unique systems. As the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), they have the upgrades readily available within our expedited delivery schedules.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and shall be in accordance with the Contractors established manufacturing lead times.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333242, and the size standard is 1500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by established due date/time set forth in this notice. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joni.laster@nist.gov . No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<SUBJECT>Project Labor Agreement - MIT LL
<SOLNBR>W912WJ19X0002
<RESPDATE>102918
<CONTACT>Alysha MacDonald, Phone 9783188715, Email Alysha.MacDonald@usace.army.mil
<DESC><div>The Corps of Engineers New England District is soliciting comments from the construction communityaddressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following construction project.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<p>Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) chartered to apply advanced technology to problems of national security. The project scope of work described herein involves the construction of a new Compound Semiconductor Laboratory and Microelectronics Integration Facility on the MIT LL) campus, which is located on Hanscom Air Force Base (HAFB), Lexington, Massachusetts. The Compound Semiconductor Laboratory and Microelectronics Integration Facility (CSL-MIF) building is a Military Construction-Air Force (MCAF) project currently programmed to begin construction in Fiscal Year 2019. The CSL-MIF consists of approximately 162,000 gross square feet (GSF) of new laboratory and office space which includes a Clean Room complex for use by the Advanced Technologies Division of MIT LL.  The intent of the CSL is to consolidate MIT LL's existing compound semiconductor materials growth, fabrication and characterization facilities.  The intent of the MIF is to consolidate and enhance MIT LL's facilities for the fabrication and packaging of specialized advanced electronic prototypes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building is anticipated to be three stories and constructed using concrete foundations, a steel and reinforced concrete superstructure, and energy efficient building systems, envelope, and roofing.  The new building will be connected to other MIT LL buildings via a pedestrian connector bridge as part of this project.  Specialized construction requirements include large and sophisticated clean rooms for microprocessor development and experimentation (the total cleanroom area under filter is approximately 35,000 net square feet, designed to Federal Standard (FED STD) 209E Class 10/International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Class 4 standards); associated complex HVAC and electrical requirements; secure communications areas; hazardous, toxic, and corrosive process liquid and gas storage, transport, distribution and associated waste collection systems; and a structural and foundation system that minimizes vibrations and noise in the clean room areas.  The facility will be constructed to meet Institute of Environmental Sciences and Technology (IEST) standards for vibration control (VC) to VC-C/D with select portions to VC-E.  Required support process utilities include the following: Equipment Cooling Water (ECW), Clean Dry Air (CDA), three (3) grades of gaseous nitrogen (N2), Liquid nitrogen (LN2),  Process Vacuum (PVAC), Ultra-Pure Water - semiconductor grade (UPW), 120/208/480V single-phase and three-phase power with UPS, liquid waste treatment (pH adjustment), and abatement of hazardous exhaust streams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CSL-MIF is to be located on an existing paved parking lot that contains a cluster of trees in the center and is surrounded by other structures and as such is considered a constrained site.  The site slopes from south to north with a change in grade of approximately 28 feet.  Site improvements will include demolition of 5 buildings, expansion of the main chiller plant, providing a new feed from the main electrical distribution plant, access roads, replacement parking, relocation of existing utilities and new utility connections, landscaping, and all other work necessary to make this a complete and usable project.  Facilities are being designed as permanent construction in accordance with the Department of Defense (DoD) Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 1-200-01, General Building Requirements.  This project will comply with DoD antiterrorism/force protection requirements per UFC 4-010-01, sustainability principles in accordance with UFC 1-200-02, and High Performance and Sustainable Building Requirements.  Note that installation of laboratory-owned equipment and high-value tool sets will be completed by others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As noted above, the proposed location for the CSL-MIF is presently a parking lot on a constrained site. Therefore, a laydown, staging and storage area will be created approximately one-quarter mile south of the CSL-MIF building location by the tear-down and removal (i.e., demolition) of five 1950s era buildings.  The building demolition will include the complete removal of associated building foundations and utilities, and backfilling the foundation areas with suitable fill.  This work will require the abatement of hazardous waste in the buildings, including but not limited to, asbestos and lead paint and other materials common to building construction of the 1950s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a.	Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.	An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.	Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.	Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.	The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.	The complexity of the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c.	Shortage of skilled labor in the region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>d.	Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.	The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>g.	The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>h.	Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.	Should a PLA be executed on the above described Construction Project? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the construction project?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.	Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c.	Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area? Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>d.	Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.	This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades; do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>f.	Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area (over $25M, within 50 miles) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>g.	Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>h.	Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p><br />Please provide your responses to these questions and any comments via email to Alysha MacDonald, Contract Specialist, at alysha.macdonald@usace.army.mil no later than the close of business, 5pm EST on October 29, 2018</p>

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source - Schneider Electric
<SOLNBR>W912WJ19X0003
<RESPDATE>102918
<CONTACT>Alysha MacDonald, Phone 9783188715, Email Alysha.MacDonald@usace.army.mil
<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to require, on a sole source basis, a brand name requirement for the manufacturer Schneider Electric to supply the building management system (BMS) for the new Compound Semiconductor Laboratory and Microsystems Integration Facility (CSL-MIF) to be constructed on Hanscom Air Force Base in Lexington, MA. The procurement number is W912WJ19R0001. The CSL-MIF will be part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) campus on Hanscom Air Force Base. The CSL-MIF BMS must be interconnected to and completely compatible with the existing BMS control system on the MIT LL campus. This combined system needs to provide unhindered transfer and remote viewing of HVAC information, alarming, trending and performance monitoring from all existing and new workstations and view nodes (more than 25 across MIT LL HAFB campus). Every critical environmental and equipment-generated alarm at the MIT LL occupied buildings is annunciated to the main central alarm control, the Chilled Water Plant, and the Operations alarm monitoring centers.  Critical alarms from CSL-MIF must be capable of being acknowledged and controlled immediately upon detection thru the existing infrastructure/system to enable the protection of both personnel and equipment. As an example, a critical BMS alarm in one MIT LL building must be simultaneously monitored, annunciated, and controlled at all workstations on the entire MIT LL site. This system must operate as a wholly integrated system to ensure reliable operation and control with regard to (1) critical equipment, (2) safety alerts, (3) security notifications, and (4) data collection of emergency events and transfer to the data historian. In the event an anti-terrorism threat occurs on site which requires immediate annunciation and shutdown of outside air intakes, etc. - the integrated BMS must be able to fully coordinate, monitor, control, and alarm any inconsistencies during this event from a common command/view point and initiation request.
<p><br />The existing Schneider Electric building management system (Andover Continuum) has been installed at MIT LL for the past 30 years and is the only BMS in use for all of the buildings occupied by MIT LL at HAFB. The Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Building Management System is the latest version of the Schneider Electric BMS platforms. The next generation Schneider BMS product line EcoStruxure is fully backwards compatible with the Andover Continuum platform currently controlling the BMS for 24 buildings. It is intended that the BMS provided for the CSL-MIF be a Schneider Electric system so that it is the same as and will completely interface with the existing Schneider Electric system currently in use throughout the MIT LL campus on Hanscom Air Force Base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability of other qualified sources that can meet the requirements identified above and inherent with the referenced Schneider Electric BMS. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice of intent. All responses received within 15 days of the posting of this notice of intent will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government to require the brand name for the Schneider Electric system for the CSL-MIF procurement based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to allow alternate system manufacturers.</p>
<p><br />Submit responses within 15 days of the posting of this notice of intent via email to: Alysha.A.MacDonald@usace.army.mil (list W912WJ19R0001 - BMS in the subject line of the email) or mail to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: Alysha MacDonald, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742.</p>

The procurement number is W912WJ19R0001. The CSL-MIF will be part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) campus on Hanscom Air Force Base. The CSL-MIF fire alarm system must be interconnected to and completely compatible with the existing fire alarm system on the MIT LL campus. The fire alarm system will be connected to, and be an extension of the fire alarm system already in place at the HAFB MIT LL campus. It is required that the CSL-MIF uses a compatible platform for networking the critical control, monitoring, and audible functions to the existing central Alarm Control Center. MIT Lincoln Laboratory's current fire alarm infrastructure is a networked system that allows view and control capabilities to each of the 24 buildings from Alarm Control and three other strategic locations. These front end Network Command Centers provide real time information from each building concerning fire events, fire troubles, and supervisory conditions. They also allow for remote control of devices in the field. In order to extend these critical functions to the CSL-MIF, the fire alarm system and hardware for the CSL-MIF must be easily interconnected to and completely compatible with the existing fire alarm system on the MIT LL campus on HAFB. The new CSL-MIF fire alarm system components must provide unhindered transfer and remote viewing of life safety functions such as fire trouble and supervisory conditions as well as fire events from anywhere in the existing system. The CSL-MIF fire alarm system must have the same language protocol as the existing fire alarm system and the new system must be able to be tested and re-set from any control center in the existing system. Seamless integration with the existing campus wide fire alarm system is a life safety requirement. <br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
The Siemens XLS fire alarm system is the fire alarm system in use throughout the MIT LL campus on Hanscom Air Force Base. It is intended that the fire alarm system provided for the CSL-MIF be the Siemens XLS system so that it is the same as and will completely interface with the existing fire alarm system currently in use.<br />
<div><br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability of other qualified sources that can meet the requirements identified above and inherent with the referenced Siemens fire alarm system. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this notice of intent.

<SUBJECT>Volumetric Muscle Loss (VML) Repair Following Extremity Trauma
<SOLNBR>MTEC-19-03-VML
<RESPDATE>111318
<CONTACT>Rebecca Harmon, Phone 843-760-3358, Email rebecca.harmon@ati.org
<DESC>The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this announcement for a Request for Project Proposals (RPP) entitled, "Volumetric muscle loss (VML) repair following extremity trauma." The goal of this research is to develop an off-the-shelf biologic prototype capable of preventing, mitigating or treating traumatic large-volume muscle loss (VML) injuries of the extremities. While such injuries are devastating, irreversible, and uniformly associated with long term disability, recent advances in regenerative medicine have made new approaches possible. The Government seeks to assess the potential for repurposing products already commercially available or in clinical development for related indications, such as critical limb ischemia, iatrogenic muscle injuries, Duchene's muscular dystrophy, compartment syndrome, and severe sports medicine injuries. Products capable of regenerating or repairing multiple tissue types or creating a therapeutic wound environment will also be considered.<br /><br />MTEC:<br />The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) by providing cutting-edge technologies and supporting life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations. MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), Agreement No. W81XWH-15-9-0001, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). MTEC is currently recruiting a broad and diverse membership that includes representatives from large businesses, small businesses, "non-traditional" government contractors, academic research institutions and not-for-profit organizations.
<p>Technical Background:<br />The exact incidence of VML following combat trauma is unknown and has not been rigorously assessed. Estimates from civilian trauma indicate that ~250,000 open fractures occur per year in the US, and these commonly involve a component of VML injury. In the military, a study of battlefield injuries in 14,500 Service members evacuated from OEF/OIF from 2001-2013 suggests high VML incidence. Approximately 77% had musculoskeletal injuries and many had open soft tissue extremity wounds. Roughly 8% of all medically evacuated patients received a disability rating specifically for VML injury. The estimated life-time disability cost per patient is $340,000-440,000 in addition to medical costs and lost wages.</p>
<p>Recovery is uniformly poor, leading to significant long term disability, and leading to increased rates of delayed amputation of technically salvageable, but functionally deficient limbs. There is no agreed upon standard of care for this condition, and no clinically available therapy that can address the loss of function for this condition. The current standard of care for VML involves the use of free muscle transfer (i.e., muscle flaps) for bone coverage followed by extensive physical rehabilitation. However, most muscle flap procedures are not intended to restore muscle function except in limited circumstances. Functional muscle transfer including vasculature and innervation have been shown to improve strength to an injured muscle group. However, such procedures require a level of surgical expertise available only in limited, specialized centers.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that there will be a single solution for VML repair. Interventions will likely be required along the continuum of care, beginning close to the point of injury or during initial damage control surgery. In the course of market research, multiple products have been identified which may potentially prevent additional muscle loss and stimulate a repair response early in the course of injury. Such products may be highly valuable in a prolonged field care situation. Such interventions may offer significant improvements over currently limited treatment options.</p>
<p>Work Plan:<br />The focus of this RPP is to develop an advanced prototype of an off-the-shelf biologic capable of preventing, mitigating or treating traumatic large-volume muscle loss (VML) injuries along the continuum of care. The prototype must be able to repair injured muscle tissue to a degree suitable for extremity repair and reconstruction.</p>
<p>The work is expected to be conducted in two phases over a 5 year period of performance as follows.</p>
<p>Phase 1 (up to 2 years): An existing FDA-regulated commercial or clinical investigational product will be repurposed for VML and tested in one or more well-controlled animal bridging studies. The repurposed product must be an existing product (at a minimum of TRL 7) with demonstrated clinical benefit for at least one related skeletal muscle disorder indication, where at least one successful FDA-regulated Phase 2 clinical trial has been completed. In addition, the product should have a plausible mechanism for benefit in VML injuries. Studies will progress logically based on outcomes through go/no-go decisions after each study has achieved appropriate objectives. Product(s) will first be tested in a small proof of concept study in a rodent model. If successful, a large animal model will be used for confirmation. The optimal timing of the intervention may also be evaluated in one or more appropriate models.</p>
<p>Phase 2 Optional Follow-on work (up to 3 years): If preclinical development studies are successful, the Awardee may be offered an optional extension to conduct a small proof-of-concept clinical trial in VML-injured patients. Further negotiations will be conducted between the Awardee, MTEC, and the Government if proceeding to a clinical trial becomes feasible.</p>
<p>Financial Framework: <br />The U.S. Government (USG) currently has available approximately $2 million (M) for Fiscal Years (FY), FY18, FY19, and FY20 to fund Phase 1. It is possible that additional funds of at least $2.5M for FY21 and FY22 may become available for the continuation of this project through Phase 2.<br />MTEC anticipates that a single award will be made.</p>
<p>The Period of Performance (POP) is 24 months for Phase 1, and an additional 36 months for Phase 2 if milestones/deliverables are achieved in Phase 1.<br />Administrative Information:<br />Full proposals are due no later than November 13, 2018 at 12:00pm EST. The RPP is posted to the MTEC website (mtec-sc.org) and a notice will be posted to FedBizOpps (fbo.gov) to notify interested parties. MTEC membership is required for the submission of a full proposal in response to this MTEC RPP. Offerors submitting Full Proposals as the prime contractor must be MTEC members of good standing by November 8, 2018. To join MTEC, please visit http://mtec-sc.org/how-to-join/</p>
<p>A Proposers Conference via webinar will be held for interested parties to have their questions answered by the Government after the RPP is posted. MTEC Members will be notified when the Proposers Conference is scheduled.</p>

All responsible sources may submit a quotation which, if timely received, will be considered by the Agency. Contract will be evaluated on Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).</p>
<p>NAMRU-Dayton requests the immediate acquisition for a one time FFP contract&nbsp;for (8) independent single lane rotarods, (4) home cage activity monitors, and (4) active avoidance test systems to support a real time animal model test battery used under simulated fighter pilot conditions. The rotarod test is an industry test for assessing rodent motor coordination, grip strength and endurance. For our specific needs, they have to be individual single lane rotarods using a quiet direct drive motor, a textured running surface (so the test subjects have proper traction allowing them not to slip but also not to grip it so well that they would be able to hold themselves in one place on the wheel), and an extended drop height (&gt;20") that discourages what the industry terms &lsquo;lazy drop offs'. The top portion of the system should be open (or have a perforated lid) to allow air or chemicals to pass through and or maintain the pressure (altitude) of the external chamber accurately. <br /><br />Motor activity (or open field) home cage test systems are a standardized toxicological testing tool widely used for assessing general locomotor activity, exploratory behaviors and anxiety in rodents. We request the smaller version of the standard arenas which are called home cage activity test systems. It is critical that our chambers can be customized to allow air or chemicals to pass through the internal chamber and that they maintain the pressure (altitude) of the external chamber accurately. Therefor either perforated lids or sides is required. <br /><br />Active avoidance testing is an industry standard testing paradigm to assess conditioned learning and memory in rodents. We require chambers (often referred to as shuttle or skinner boxes) that offer dual stimulus (light and tone) output, shock-grid flooring, an automated center door and overall dimensions that allow for the placement of 2 test systems in each of our 2 custom designed environmental chambers. It is critical that our chambers can be customized to allow air or chemicals to pass through the internal chamber and that they maintain the pressure (altitude) of the external chamber accurately. Therefor either perforated lids or sides is required.</p>
<p>All 3 test types must be customized so that the overall dimensions allow for (2) test systems to be placed into a single custom 3x3x3ft environmental chamber. It is important that all 3 test types can be easily interchanged within the environmental chambers therefore a central node or control unit and data acquisition software that can power and communicate with all (3) systems is highly recommended.</p>
<p>Based on experimental design in conjunction with unique customized environmental chambers, as stated previously within in each test system above, we require an all or nothing approach from a vendor that can offer all 3 systems fully customized to our specifications and driven by a single node or control unit type utilizing USB to PC connectivity and data control and acquisition software that accommodates all three units for simplifying data analyses in order to meet customer deadlines. The device should also have a central control unit or node type that can accommodate all three testing systems and USB connectivity and some type of standard or proprietary data acquisition software that control all three test types.</p>
<p>Finally, this is an extremely time sensitive experiment and deadlines must be met. The company must be able to fabricate customized test systems and have them delivered and offer any necessary support or training within 6 weeks of award.</p>

<DESC><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong>
<div><strong><br /></strong>The Duplication Services service unit at the Library of Congress provides the public with print and digitized copies of nearly everything held in the Library's collections in numerous formats.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />The most popular delivery format is digital PDFs and TIFFs. Customers are often researchers, scholars, publishers, and documentarians.</div>

<div><br /><strong>CONTRACT TYPE:</strong></div>
<div><strong><br /></strong> The Contractor will receive orders on an on-demand basis.  Meaning, that when the Duplication Services service unit receives a large order, the Contractor will be contacted and the work order will be outsourced via a Task Order issued against a base Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract utilizing the pre-negotiated price list contained therein.  All Task Orders will be issued on a firm fixed price basis and may be issued at any time during the period of performance of the base IDIQ contract.
<p><strong>SCOPE OF WORK: </strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide scanning and production of digital images from original Library source materials to archival/FADGI standards on an as-needed basis, both at the Contractor's facility and on-site at the Library of Congress (when digitizing from rare and/or fragile materials than cannot leave the Library) in support of the Duplication Services service unit of the Library of Congress during the period of performance of this contract.</p>

<p>&nbsp; <br />Materials must be digitized to meet individual project needs, to be specified in each issued Task Order. Typically, our standard is 300 ppi 24-bit color uncompressed TIFF images.  The camera should be calibrated to FADGI 3- star (http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov) using the DICE target prior to the start of each scan session. Archival TIFFs and JPEG files should be loaded onto a hard drive.  If copying or digitizing microfilm, the Contractor must supply a positive reel.<br />It is expected that the contractor's pricing includes: image processing, metadata collection/filename schema, quality review (100%), materials, media delivery, shipping, taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The following requirements for digitization services may be ordered via the antcipated contract and offerors must demonstrate in their proposal their ability and experience to providing the following services and to digitize to FADGI archival standards (project-specific standards will be supplied at time of order):</p>
<p><br />1) Provide FADGI 3 star scans of print materials in bulk</p>

<p>7) Digitize original materials (including microfilm, microfiche, photographs, negatives, slides, and paper based items such as newspapers, correspondence, journals, blueprints, maps, etc.)</p>
<p>8)&nbsp;Develop project plans that enable Contractor to meet deadlines.  Each deadline will be assessed on a project by project basis and agreed upon before the work is awarded.</p>

<p>10) OCR document files as requested on order</p>
<p>11) Create 2D and 3D capable files.</p>
<p>12) Print 2D and 3D files.</p>
<p><strong>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: </strong></p>
<p>Task Orders against the base Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract may be placed at any time during the base IDIQ contract period of performance.</p>
<p><br />The contract period of performance of this Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract is anticipated to be as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;					<br />Base year: November 15, 2018- November 14, 2019.<br />Option year 1:  November 15, 2019- November 14, 2020.<br />Option year 2:  November 15, 2020- November 14, 2021.<br />Option year 3:  November 15, 2021- November 14, 2022.<br />Option year 4:  November 15, 2022- November 14, 2023.</p>

<p><br /><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong>Please reference <strong>Section L</strong> in the attached Solicitation, <strong>"Proposal Submission Instructions - Best Value Trade-Off"</strong>, for instructions on how to prepare and submit your proposal (and what information should be included to constitute a complete proposal - <strong>the information being requested is beyond a simple price quote and it is critical that offerors supply information demonstrating their ability and experience in providing the requested digitization services to FADGI archival standards</strong> as this information will be key in the selection of the awardee.  The awardee will NOT be selected on the basis of "Lowest Price - Technically Acceptable", but rather on the basis of "Best Value - Trade Off" whereby the Corporate Experience and Past Performance evaluation factors will be critical in the award selection process and when combined, are considered to be more important than price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reference <strong>Section M</strong> of the attached solicitation, <strong>"Evaluation Factors for Award"</strong> for full details as to how the Government will evaluate offers and select the awardee.</p>
<p><strong>As indicated in Section L, please reference and complete the Pricing Template, Attachment One to the solicitation, for Library-supplied pricing assumptions and the items to be priced.</strong> (Offerors may use their own format/forms as long as all of the requested pricing information is included).</p>

<SUBJECT>Department of Defense Uniform Formulary Blanket Purchase Agreement/ Uniform Formulary Additional Discount Program
<SOLNBR>HT9402-18-Q-0008(3)
<RESPDATE>110218
<CONTACT>Yvette H. Dluhos, Contract Specialist, Email yvette.h.dluhos.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Background: <br />The Department of Defense (DoD) is required by law (10 U.S.C. &sect; 1074g) to establish an effective, efficient, integrated pharmacy benefits program for the Military Health System (MHS) which includes the purchase pharmaceutical agents. The law and implementing regulation (32 CFR Section 199.21) describe the process by which the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Committee will consider the relative clinical effectiveness and relative cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class in recommending the selection of agents for the DoD Uniform Formulary (UF) and, for cost sharing purposes, the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, Basic Core Formulary (BCF), Extended Core Formulary (ECF), or non-formulary (NF). Prior to the scheduled P&amp;T Committee meeting, a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for pharmaceutical agents within Drug Classes identified for placement on the UF has been issued to obtain quotes from industry. The Defense Health Agency may award Uniform Formulary Blanket Purchase Agreements (UF BPA) and the Uniform Formulary Additional Discount Program Agreements (UF ADP) based on the UF decision. This process is described in the attached RFQ.
<p>P&amp;T COMMITTEE MEETING: November 2018: The following drug classes/subclass and newly approved agents will be reviewed: <br /><br />MIGRAINE AGENTS - CALCITONIN GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE (CGRP) ANTAGONIST: Ajovy; Emgality<br /><br />ACNE AGENTS - TOPICAL ACNE AND ROSACEA: Altreno; Plixda<br /><br />ANTIBIOTICS - AMINOGLYCOSIDES: Arikayce<br /><br />ONCOLOGICAL AGENTS - CLL: Copiktra<br /><br />ANTIRETROVIRALS - COMBINATIONS: Delstrigo<br /><br />ANTICONVULSANTS-ANTIMANIA AGENTS - N/A: Epidiolex<br /><br />ANTIHEMOPHILIC FACTORS - N/A: Jivi<br /><br />ANTIBIOTICS - TETRACYCLINES: Minolira<br /><br />HEMATOLOGICAL AGENTS - WHITE BLOOD CELLS STIMULANTS: Nivestim<br /><br />ANTIRETROVIRALS - NUCLEOSIDE / NUCLEOTIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE&nbsp;INHIBITOR: Pifeltro<br /><br />ONCOLOGICAL AGENTS - N/A: Vizimpro<br /><br />ANTIBIOTICS - QUINOLONES: Xepi<br /><br />PAIN AGENTS - LOCAL: ZTLido</p>
<p>RFQ: The RFQ, including UF BPA and UF ADP appendices are attached herein. <br />There is no pre-proposal teleconference. Rather, questions shall be submitted via e-mail to the Request for Quote (RFQ) Point of Contact stated in Part 2.3, no later than the date stated in Part 2.4. Also, responses to Part 3.4 is required.</p>
<p>POCs: Part 2.3 of the RFQ. <br />For additional information, search DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Committee at http://www.health.mil/POD</p>

(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

(d) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts that exceed the micro-purchase threshold.<BR><BR>Availability of Funds (Apr 1984)

Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Governments obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>(a) Method of payment.
(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term EFT refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the SAM database.
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210.
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractors EFT information in the SAM database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the SAM database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractors EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.<BR><BR>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractors EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the SAM database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractors financial agent.
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the SAM database.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 32.706-3, insert the following clause:

(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., click-wrap or browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71 until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71. The submission may be converted to a claim under 41 U.S.C chapter 71, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
(ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
(iii) The certification shall state as follows: I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor.<BR><BR>(3) The certification may be executed by any person authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officers decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in 41 U.S.C chapter 71.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractors specific reasons for rejecting the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.
(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 33.106, insert the following provision:

The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in HHSAR Subpart 326.6. (b) General. (1) Under the Buy Indian Act, offers for this acquisition will be solicited only from Indian small business economic enterprises. (2) IHS will reject all offers received from ineligible enterprises (see cascading set-aside).

Bonds are not required in the case of contracts with Indian tribes or public nonprofit organizations serving as governmental instrumentalities of an Indian tribe. However, bonds are required when dealing with private business entities owned by an Indian tribe or members of an Indian tribe. The contracting officer may require bonds of private business entities that are joint ventures with, or subcontractors of, an Indian tribe or a public nonprofit organization serving as a governmental instrumentality of an Indian tribe. A bid guarantee or bid bond is required only when a performance or payment bond is required. <br />(d) Indian preference in employment, training and subcontracting. Contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act are subject to the requirements of section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act 25 U.S.C. 450e, which requires giving preference to Indians in employment, training, and subcontracting. <br />(e) Subcontracting. A contractor shall not subcontract more than 50 percent of the work under a prime contract awarded pursuant to the Buy Indian Act to non-Indian firms. For this purpose, contract work does not include the provision of materials, supplies, or equipment. <br />(f) Wage rates.

<DESC>Contract Delivery Service - Contracting Opportunities<br />Contract Delivery Service is a contractual agreement between the U.S. Postal Service and an individual or company for the delivery and collection of mail. The typical service required at the local Post Office<sup>TM</sup> will involve sorting mail for the route, driving to the route, delivering mail and parcels to specified addresses, picking up collection mail, and returning to the Post Office. The contract route will operate six days per week, Monday through Saturday, with possible Sunday deliveries and may include holidays. The carrier is required to use their own vehicle for mail delivery service.
<p>Contract Delivery Service carriers are not USPS employees but are independent contractors who provide service on specific routes. By becoming a contract delivery service supplier for the USPS, you sign on as an independent contractor who delivers and collects mail. You will not be an employee of the USPS, which means you won't be eligible for benefits.<br /><br />You will be required to pass both a background check and a drug test before the USPS can consider you for a contract delivery service contract. Even though you will not be an actual employee, the USPS is a government agency; which means an extensive screening process is necessary. You also must be 21 years old to be considered for a contractor position.</p>

<DESC>Contract Delivery Service - Contracting Opportunities<br />Contract Delivery Service is a contractual agreement between the U.S. Postal Service and an individual or company for the delivery and collection of mail. The typical service required at the local Post Office<sup>TM</sup> will involve sorting mail for the route, driving to the route, delivering mail and parcels to specified addresses, picking up collection mail, and returning to the Post Office. The contract route will operate six days per week, Monday through Saturday, with possible Sunday deliveries and may include holidays. The carrier is required to use their own vehicle for mail delivery service.<br /><br />Contract Delivery Service carriers are not USPS employees but are independent contractors who provide service on specific routes. By becoming a contract delivery service supplier for the USPS, you sign on as an independent contractor who delivers and collects mail. You will not be an employee of the USPS, which means you won't be eligible for benefits.
<p>You will be required to pass both a background check and a drug test before the USPS can consider you for a contract delivery service contract. Even though you will not be an actual employee, the USPS is a government agency; which means an extensive screening process is necessary. You also must be 21 years old to be considered for a contractor position.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The solicitation number is W9124V18R0004 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).<br />The proposed contract is 100% competitive set aside for small business concerns. NAICS code is 812320, with size standard of 5.5 million.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-97, effective 6 November 2017.</p>
<p>Offers shall propose a firm fixed price for laundry service in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement.  SCA/FLSA is applicable, see attachment "WD 15-5399 (Rev.-5) for labor rates, vendor is responsible for checking rates prior to submittal of proposals. The Government will use Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) to evaluate quotes using technical acceptability and then price to determine the best value.  Award will be made as a Requirements contract, see PWS paragraph 1.6.6 also Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.503.  Task Order will be issued against the base contract.  Vendors will provide pricing for all items on attachment "TC-CIF Laundry list".  For evaluation of proposals and to determine the lowest price, proposals will be based of item prices compared to "TC-CIF annual numbers".  The "TC-CIF Laundry list spreadsheet shows all items that may be laundered, the "TC-CIF annual numbers" is the average list of items and numbers that were laundered over the last few years.</p>
<p>Attachment "W9124V18R0004 4FBO" will include CLIN, clause, provision, and work statement details.</p>
<p>Contract has a base of two (2) years and two options, option one is two (2) years and option 2 is one (1) year for a total of 5 possible years of service.  Proposals are expected, not required, to have an annual escalation in price.  Attached spreadsheet "Sample Base and Option Year Pricing" can be used (if convenient) to show escalation of pricing over the 5 year period.  All items will need a price per item for the proposal to be technically acceptable, either "Sample Base and Option Year Pricing " or "TC-CIF Laundry list " must be filled in to show item price.  "TC-CIF annual numbers" shows estimated quantities based off historical information, these quantities will be applied to the vendors proposed pricing to establish the Government evaluation of price.</p>
<p>Example, annually we will require an estimated 1,810 twin sheets per year to be laundered.  A proposal has a price of $.50 per sheet for year 1 (June 1, 2018 - May 31, 2019), $.55 per sheet for year 2, $.55 per sheet for year 3, $.60 per sheet for year 4 and $.65 per sheet for year 5.  Total evaluated price for that item would be (1810 x .50 = $905.00), (1810 x .55 = $995), ($995), ($1086), and ($1176.5) for a total evaluated price of $5,157.50 for the twin sheets.  The same would apply to all items on the "TC-CIF annual numbers."</p>
<p>A site visit (if necessary) is planned for May 3rd, 2018 at approximately 10:00 am local. If no communication is made prior to the planned site visit date, no site visit will be conducted.&nbsp; Questions should be submitted no later than May 8th to allow proper time for response and amendment to the solicitation for posting Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Items may be added after award, if items are added a price will be negotiated with the awarded vendor and the contract modified to reflect the new item(s).</p>

<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver.

<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov no later than 1700 hrs PST, October 25, 2018.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Beverly J. Parker at (541) 867-8730 or beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov  for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES: This is a Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source purchase order under Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13.106- 1(b). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Headquarters Procurement Operations Division (HPOD) Washington, D.C. intends to award a Sole Source purchase order to University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics (UW-Madison ),. It has been determined that University is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Governments requirements. This is for the purchase of membership in the Wisconsin National Data Consortium (WiNDC). The technical service agreements (time and materials) may be established for targeted model development and analysis.
The EPAs Office of the Administrator, Office of Policy, National Center for Environmental Economics, in collaboration with other EPA program offices, requires technical support to foster development of open source multisector economic datasets at the national, state and local government level that is suitable for analysis of energy-environment-economic issues using a general equilibrium modeling framework.  These models utilize economic input-output tables scaled at the national, state and local government level, combined with other economic data (e.g., US Census household data from the American Community Survey and foreign trade statistics; US International Trade Administration bilateral trade statistics; physical energy quantities and prices from the US Department of Energy, Energy Information Agencys State Energy Data Systems), to construct benchmark equilibrium databases suitable for use in EPAs regulatory policy analyses Access to these datasets and modeling tools will serve to support the Agencys statutory requirements, and provisions included in Executive Orders, to evaluate the economic costs, benefits and impacts of economically significant environmental regulations proposed and issues as final rules by the Agency.
Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPAs requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, by October 26, 2018 at 12pm. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. Please send your response to: irby.kenneth@epa.gov.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) terminate the contract for default.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</span></p>

The increasing adoption of digital and remotely controlled systems has improved efficiencies in the electricity sector in Brazil, but it has also elevated concerns about the sector's resiliency and ability to withstand cybersecurity threats. With the exception of the State of Roraima, Brazil has an interconnected, inter-state transmission grid. Brazil currently has an installed generation capacity of 137 GW and over one thousand transmission substations, resulting in a considerable number of sites in need of cybersecurity protection.</p>
<p>Companhia Paranaense de Energia ("Copel") is the electricity and generation company for the State of Paran&aacute; and has become a national standard for operations automation. Copel has implemented solutions for remote access to substation supervision, as well as other mission critical solutions for its operations. Copel has 38 transmission substations and 21 generation stations and is critical for the energy security of the State of Parana.</p>
<p>Copel seeks Technical Assistance for three main reasons. First, Copel would like to help identify vulnerabilities related to its operational systems, including gaps in its security protocols, processes, regulations, and technologies. It would also help develop an implementation plan for the installation and upgrade of cybersecurity solutions, protocols and procedures, using the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection Plan (CIP) as a reference. The adoption of NERC CIP-based standards would better position U.S. vendors for future procurements.</p>
<p>Second, this technical assistance would develop the specifications and requirements for a follow&shy;on pilot to be implemented directly by Copel, immediately following the conclusion of the technical assistance. The technical assistance would not include the pilot but would provide Copel with the necessary technical analyses to move forward with the pilot. Third, Copel is committed to using the recommendations of the technical assistance to promote and advocate for new cybersecurity regulations in the country. As one of the first major utility-scale cybersecurity projects in the country, this activity is anticipated to be a catalyst for future projects and serve as a model for future standards and regulations.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$601,455 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1100, Arlington, VA 22209. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.ustda.gov/business- opportunities/request-proposal-form</span></strong></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-997-2392. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Portuguese directly to the Grantee by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2:00 PM local time in Curitiba, Paran&aacute;, on November 28, 2018</strong></span> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.</p>
<p>The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which, if timely received, will be considered by the Agency. Contract will be evaluated on Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).</p>
<p>NAMRU-Dayton requests the immediate acquisition for a one time FFP contract&nbsp;for (8) independent single lane rotarods, (4) home cage activity monitors, and (4) active avoidance test systems to support a real time animal model test battery used under simulated fighter pilot conditions. The rotarod test is an industry test for assessing rodent motor coordination, grip strength and endurance. For our specific needs, they have to be individual single lane rotarods using a quiet direct drive motor, a textured running surface (so the test subjects have proper traction allowing them not to slip but also not to grip it so well that they would be able to hold themselves in one place on the wheel), and an extended drop height (&gt;20") that discourages what the industry terms &lsquo;lazy drop offs'. The top portion of the system should be open (or have a perforated lid) to allow air or chemicals to pass through and or maintain the pressure (altitude) of the external chamber accurately. <br /><br />Motor activity (or open field) home cage test systems are a standardized toxicological testing tool widely used for assessing general locomotor activity, exploratory behaviors and anxiety in rodents. We request the smaller version of the standard arenas which are called home cage activity test systems. It is critical that our chambers can be customized to allow air or chemicals to pass through the internal chamber and that they maintain the pressure (altitude) of the external chamber accurately. Therefor either perforated lids or sides is required. <br /><br />Active avoidance testing is an industry standard testing paradigm to assess conditioned learning and memory in rodents. We require chambers (often referred to as shuttle or skinner boxes) that offer dual stimulus (light and tone) output, shock-grid flooring, an automated center door and overall dimensions that allow for the placement of 2 test systems in each of our 2 custom designed environmental chambers. It is critical that our chambers can be customized to allow air or chemicals to pass through the internal chamber and that they maintain the pressure (altitude) of the external chamber accurately. Therefor either perforated lids or sides is required.</p>
<p>All 3 test types must be customized so that the overall dimensions allow for (2) test systems to be placed into a single custom 3x3x3ft environmental chamber. It is important that all 3 test types can be easily interchanged within the environmental chambers therefore a central node or control unit and data acquisition software that can power and communicate with all (3) systems is highly recommended.</p>
<p>Based on experimental design in conjunction with unique customized environmental chambers, as stated previously within in each test system above, we require an all or nothing approach from a vendor that can offer all 3 systems fully customized to our specifications and driven by a single node or control unit type utilizing USB to PC connectivity and data control and acquisition software that accommodates all three units for simplifying data analyses in order to meet customer deadlines. The device should also have a central control unit or node type that can accommodate all three testing systems and USB connectivity and some type of standard or proprietary data acquisition software that control all three test types.</p>
<p>Finally, this is an extremely time sensitive experiment and deadlines must be met. The company must be able to fabricate customized test systems and have them delivered and offer any necessary support or training within 6 weeks of award.</p>

Requirements for the 2019 Bulk Fuel Additives procurement purchase program are now being solicited under the number SPE602-19-R-0702, due to EBS now automatically assigning a solicitation number.</p>
<p>Please direct your attention to SPE602-19-R-0702 for all notices for the 2019 Bulk Fuels Additives procurement purchase program from this point forward.</p>
<p>This is the synopsis for the upcoming 2019 DLA Energy Bulk Fuel Additives procurement which includes requirements for three additives: Fuel System Icing Inhibitor (FSII), Corrosion Inhibitor (CLA) and Diesel Fuel Additive (LIA) procurement. The anticipated ordering period is date of award through April 30, 2021 with the delivery period being May 1, 2019 through April 30, 2021, with a 30-day carryover, unless otherwise designated.

Offerors will be required to load in 5,000 USG ISO-containers and transport via truck to European destinations and cargo vessel/truck to Middle Eastern destinations. For Continental (US) CONUS locations, the delivery method used is tank truck. The specific details will be included within the schedule of the solicitation by product and location. The total estimated quantity is as follows:</p>
<p>FSII - 3,887,000 USG <br />NSN: 6850-01-057-6427<br />MIL-DTL-85470B dated 1 June 1999</p>
<p>CLA - 12,000 USG<br />NSN: 9140-01-628-6264<br />MIL-PRF-25017H (1) dated 2 October 2016</p>
<p>LIA - 80,000 USG<br />NSN: 9140-01-604-2853<br />MIL-PRF-32490 dated 25 February 2014</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>1. The CLA additive is a fuel-soluble corrosion inhibitor/lubricity improver additive for use in aviation turbine fuel, motor gasoline, diesel fuel, and related petroleum products. It is defined by MIL-PRF-25017. Awards will be made only for products that are, at the time of award of contract, qualified and included in the Qualified Products List (QPL) No. 25017 which can be found at http://qpldocs.dla.mil/.</p>
<p>2. The LIA additive is one of two grades of diesel lubricity improver additives that are used in naval distillate fuels conforming to MIL-DTL-16884. It is defined by MIL-PRF-32490. All LIA products offered must be listed on the Qualified Products List (QPL) to be considered for award (link: http://qpldocs.dla.mil/). LIA products not on the QPL list will need to be vetted and approved. Please contact Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, ATTN: SEA 05S, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, SE, Stop 5160, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-5160 or emailed to CommandStandards@navy.mil for vetting process.</p>
<p>3. All offers of products FSII, CLA, LIA, must indicate the product name and product manufacturer in the offer being submitted. All offers with products indicated that are not manufactured by the offeror must include a Supply Commitment Letter with the offer to indicate/verify the offeror's ability to provide products of the type and quantity indicated within its offer. See Section L of the solicitation for the requirements of what must be included in the Supply Commitment Letter.</p>
<p>4. Colonial Pipeline, VA: In addition to the requirements for CLA appearing in Quality Assurance Provision (QAP) C30-2, CLA supplied to this location are required to meet one of the low temperature viscosity requirements specified below. This additional requirement for CLA is due to infrastructure capability restrictions at this location. This performance requirement must be met in order to ensure pumpability of the product at this location.</p>
<p>a) Dynamic viscosity 450 centipoise (cP) maximum at 0 degrees Fahrenheit as measured by ASTM test method D 2983, or</p>
<p>b) Kinematic viscosity 350 centistokes (cSt) maximum at 30 degrees Fahrenheit as measured by ASTM test method D 445.</p>
<p>5. United Arab Emirates Embargo of Qatar:</p>
<p>Due to the current Qatar embargo issued by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) issued a Notice to Mariner(s) stating that UAE ports will not allow ships to load any cargo from UAE destined for Qatar. The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MOFIC) has declined to issue written assurance that the Notice to Mariner(s) is not applicable to U.S. DOD cargo destined for Qatar. Therefore, all FSII bid line proposals with shipping points or utilizing supply points in UAE will NOT be evaluated to Qatar.</p>
<p>Offerors submitting FSII bid lines with shipping points or utilizing supply points located in nations who are participating in the Qatar Embargo (other than UAE) or are otherwise imposing additional restrictions on shipping product to Qatar must provide documentation from cognizant port authority or management verifying the ability to provide product for delivery to Qatar. If sufficient documentation is not submitted, the bid lines will not be evaluated to Qatar. As of the date of this synopsis, the following countries, in addition to the UAE, have publically cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and/or are participating in the embargo: Bahrain, Comoros, Egypt, Maldives, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, and Yemen. Please note that this list is neither exhaustive nor authoritative, and offerors are responsible for notifying DLA Energy whether the nations in which their shipping points or supply points are located are participating in the embargo or have some other similar restriction on shipping product to Qatar.</p>
<p>6.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-101. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 561790 with a small business size standard of $7.50M. This requirement is a [ 8a Competitive ] set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit bids.

FOB Destination shall be in the Statement of Work.<BR><BR>The DHS Federal Emergency Management Agency requires the following items, Purchase Description Determined by Line Item, to the following:  <BR><span class="label">LI 001: </span>Perform site inspection reports (SIR) on homes damaged by Hurricane Maria. SIRs will be utilized by FEMA to determine eligibility and feasibility of dwellings to be repaired under the Permanent Housing Construction (PHC) program. Not all inspected homes will be eligible for subsequent repair program due to statutory limits. Period of performance will be three months from contract issuance. Once FEMA identifies a home for a SIR, contractor must submit completed SIR in five calendar days. FEMA anticipates ordering up to five SIRs per day. FEMA reserves right to make one or more contract awards resulting from this solicitation. Awarded vendors who perform an SIR on a dwelling are ineligible to bid on the repair of that same dwelling. See attached example of a completed SIR. Vendor may propose its own format. The SIR will identify the damage and describe in detail the repairs required to restore dwelling to a safe, functional, and habitable condition, per local, Commonwealth, and Federal (Housing and Urban Development (HUD)) standards, codes, and regulations. The SIR will provide a material list required for repairs. The SIR will provide a detailed cost estimate, inclusive of material, labor and profit, fees, permits, applications, etc. In compiling the cost estimate, the vendor will take into account that actual repair will be performed by a licensed, bonded, and insured building contractor, authorized to work in the Commonwealth. All repair work will use common materials. In some cases repairs are significant and in order to bring the property up to code the contractor will be required to demolish the existing structure and rebuild it. Types of units may consist of a mix of studio, 1-bedroom, 2- bedroom, 3-bedroom, and 4 bedroom homes.  The cost estimate will utilize the more stringent code or practice in case of conflict between local, state or  federal code. The SIR will include photos of the dwelling, to include both interior and exterior damage and room by room. Assessors must be licensed and fully qualified in construction cost estimating. Contractor shall use common cost-estimating software such as Xactimate. Repair estimates shall incorporate local and  Federal environmental and historic preservation (EHP) laws and regulations, and widely accepted construction industry standards. Some homes may require dwelling be repaired or restored to allow for accessible to applicants 
with disabilities, to include the provision of marked and signed accessible parking, and access to the unit and common areas.  This assessment (and any follow-on construction) shall be in compliance with the federal Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS). Cost estimate will consider that the Buy American Act is applicable to all repair materials., 150, EA;<BR><BR><a href="http://marketplace.fedbid.com/fbweb/fbobuyDetails.do?token=%3D%3DwBKxmaVGYR9mn7UsarBoudQAAAAAHeAAgAgTFCGg%2FFzzqQbJAAyVXBA0Or">Solicitation and Buy Attachments</a><BR><BR>***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Buyer to respond.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions and Answers</span></strong></p>
<p>Q1. The solicitation states a requirement for the contractor to provide role players of two types, trauma patients and displaced people, based on the scenario. This does not provide us with the information to estimate how many of both types of role players are required. The government does state later in the solicitation that the contractor shall provide enough ambulatory patients to allow for 60 personnel per hour, however, this is not adequate for us to develop actual numbers. Depending upon how many triage, treatment, and decontamination teams there are, the number of role players required could vary greatly. Please provide either the number of role players of all types requested, or provide further detail into how many personnel will be processed through in an hour's time along with how many teams are involved in exercise.</p>
<p><strong>A1. Typically there are about 40 Role players total. 20 trauma and 20 displace. But, offeror should ensure enough personnel to not allow for breaks in training.</strong></p>
<p>Q2. The solicitation states two locations for two days are required, however, there is a schedule that has 4 days of events and only at one location (Indiana). Is the contractor only needed for two days or four days per exercise? Are there two events, in Florida and Indiana of two days of support each exercise or does the contractor need to be there for four days per exercise? Are role players needed for two days (days 2 and 3) and key personnel such as contract manager, NIMS/ICS, coroner/EMS coordinator needed on days 1 and 4?</p>
<p><strong>A2. Personnel are only needed for 2 days at each exercise on the days listed in paragraph 1.3 of the PWS. The Schedules of Events is attached to the PWS to show the flow of the exercise. It is not required that the NIMC/ICS subjected matter expert to be there for all four days. However, it may be to their benefit to come the day before, so they can coordinate activities for the next day and not miss any time hacks.</strong></p>
<p>Q3. How many mannequins are requested of what types? The government gives weight ranges, but does not list the quantity that it requires for their exercises.</p>
<p><strong>A3. It is felt that 25 mannequins would be sufficient to conduct the exercise. The mix shall be in accordance with paragraph 5.2.1.3.6</strong></p>
<p>Q4. Will food services be provided by the government for contractor staff and role players, breakfast, lunch, dinner? Are water and restroom facilities made available to contractor staff and role players?</p>
<p><strong>A4. No the Government is not providing meals for contractor personnel. Portable latrines will be available and can have some placed near the player center.</strong></p>
<p>Q5. Is there a location at each training facility where role players and contractor staff can park their vehicles? What is the distance between available parking and training location? <br /><br /><strong>A5. Currently there is parking available at the exercise sites. In the event that this changes the distance from the next available parking area to the training site is less than a quarter mile.</strong></p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The solicitation number is W9124V18R0004 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).<br />The proposed contract is 100% competitive set aside for small business concerns. NAICS code is 812320, with size standard of 5.5 million.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-97, effective 6 November 2017.</p>
<p>Offers shall propose a firm fixed price for laundry service in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement.  SCA/FLSA is applicable, see attachment "WD 15-5399 (Rev.-5) for labor rates, vendor is responsible for checking rates prior to submittal of proposals. The Government will use Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) to evaluate quotes using technical acceptability and then price to determine the best value.  Award will be made as a Requirements contract, see PWS paragraph 1.6.6 also Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.503.  Task Order will be issued against the base contract.  Vendors will provide pricing for all items on attachment "TC-CIF Laundry list".  For evaluation of proposals and to determine the lowest price, proposals will be based of item prices compared to "TC-CIF annual numbers".  The "TC-CIF Laundry list spreadsheet shows all items that may be laundered, the "TC-CIF annual numbers" is the average list of items and numbers that were laundered over the last few years.</p>
<p>Attachment "W9124V18R0004 4FBO" will include CLIN, clause, provision, and work statement details.</p>
<p>Contract has a base of two (2) years and two options, option one is two (2) years and option 2 is one (1) year for a total of 5 possible years of service.  Proposals are expected, not required, to have an annual escalation in price.  Attached spreadsheet "Sample Base and Option Year Pricing" can be used (if convenient) to show escalation of pricing over the 5 year period.  All items will need a price per item for the proposal to be technically acceptable, either "Sample Base and Option Year Pricing " or "TC-CIF Laundry list " must be filled in to show item price.  "TC-CIF annual numbers" shows estimated quantities based off historical information, these quantities will be applied to the vendors proposed pricing to establish the Government evaluation of price.</p>
<p>Example, annually we will require an estimated 1,810 twin sheets per year to be laundered.  A proposal has a price of $.50 per sheet for year 1 (June 1, 2018 - May 31, 2019), $.55 per sheet for year 2, $.55 per sheet for year 3, $.60 per sheet for year 4 and $.65 per sheet for year 5.  Total evaluated price for that item would be (1810 x .50 = $905.00), (1810 x .55 = $995), ($995), ($1086), and ($1176.5) for a total evaluated price of $5,157.50 for the twin sheets.  The same would apply to all items on the "TC-CIF annual numbers."</p>
<p>A site visit is planned for May 3rd, 2018 at 9:30 am local.&nbsp; Valid drivers license is required to get on base.&nbsp; Questions should be submitted no later than May 4th to allow proper time for response and amendment to the solicitation for posting Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Items may be required to be added after award, if items are added a price will be negotiated with the awarded vendor and the contract modified to reflect the new item(s).</p>
<p>Response date has been reduced by one week from the original post do to May 7th, 2018.&nbsp; Review of the requirements and mission requirements has deemed this neccesary.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing an Invitation for Bids for Infrastructure<br />Construction at the Raybestos Memorial Ballfield Superfund Site in Stratford CT as a small business set aside.<br />The NAICS code for this procurement is 237310. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000 and<br />$5,000,000.<br />The project's performance period is expected to take approximately 6-8 months.<br />The Raymark Industries, Inc. Superfund Site ("Site") includes areas that have been contaminated as a result of<br />manufacturing processes from the former Raymark Industries, Inc. facility, which was located at 75 East Main<br />Street, Stratford, Connecticut. The Site has been divided into nine operable units, or OUs. OU#4, a portion of<br />which is known as the Raybestos Memorial Ballfield, was a former disposal area for Raymark facility and other<br />wastes. Use of OU#4 as a ballfield was discontinued decades ago and the property is currently abandoned,<br />overgrown and littered with construction type debris.<br />The purpose of this project is to prepare OU#4 to receive wastes from other operating units (consolidation) and<br />ultimately to be capped. Specifically this project will create an all-weather construction haul road approximately<br />1,300 LF from Longwood Avenue through the abutting Contract Plating parcel to provide access to the OU#4. <br /><strong><em>Contamination is present on contract plating site. Available environmental information regarding site conditions on contract plating can be found in the specifications and/or Solicitation Amendments.<br /></em></strong>In addition approximately 2,400 LF of sound and visual barriers are to be constructed to screen the adjacent<br />residential houses from the future clearing and grubbing of OU4, and the future waste consolidation and capping<br />of OU4. Barrier height shall be 8 to 24 feet. Approximately 1,200 LF of permanent precast concrete panel barrier is<br />to be provided with the remainder to be temporary acoustical fence. Permanent planting for screening the fence<br />from the residences is included. Additionally approximately 1,500 LF of security fencing is to be provided along the<br />property borders at Frog Pond Lane and Longbrook Avenue and between the Contract Plating Parcel and OU#4<br />with multiple vehicular and pedestrian access gates.<br />The sound barrier and fence alignment will require clearing to be able to construct including temporary access as<br />much of the barrier will be on top of ledge. The location of the barrier has been investigated and does not appear<br />to have any Raymark waste, however a contingency plan for handling any encountered waste will be required.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />Force Protection Surveillance and Detection Enabling Technologies <br />Issued by the Product Manager (PdM) Force Protection Systems (FPS) on behalf of the Tactical Security System (TSS) Capability Development<br />1.0 SYNOPSIS<br />The Product Manager (PdM) Force Protection Systems (FPS) is seeking information from interested parties on readily available, commercial based surveillance, detection, and sensor network capabilities / solutions that have either been proven in field trials or by prototype testing in order to identify and evaluate innovative technologies and novel concepts that could potentially enhance US Army Force Protection (FP) abilities. These will be employed in either a stand-alone network configuration, or combined with other integrated based defense (IBD) and force FP systems supporting Base Camp (BC) and Theater Detention Facility (TDF) operations. The focus of this RFI is on mature surveillance and detection system elements and components capable of surveillance, detection and tracking of targets of interest such as walking humans, small vehicles, and large vehicles within a range of 1500 meters from an external perimeter security position and monitoring internal BC (battalion sized) or designated installation security areas as well as performing dedicated TDF operations. Primary interest is on complementary technologies and systems that can be used in an extendible networked configuration to provide the ability to detect, monitor, track threats, and increase standoff distances from hostile threats. This added capability will enhance a Commander's Force Protection (FP) Situational Awareness (SA), and improve response time and Soldier survivability. Major technologies and system component categories of interest covered in this RFI are imaging sensors, motion, and surface detection technologies, secure high-speed network (wired and wireless) interfaces and communications devices, full motion video surveillance and recording measures, open system and architected command and control (C2) applications, and sustainable, self-contained power supply and power management and distribution control capabilities. In addition, innovative concepts for system integration of promising surveillance and detection technologies and/or solutions are also under consideration. These system integrated capabilities must provide U.S. forces with the capability to operate and deploy FP technologies for extended periods of operation without added logistic and operational burden to the maximum extent possible. All technologies and capabilities presented should cite advantages and limitations, specifically addressing their employment in a stand-alone capacity or in a combined capabilities, and presenting how they may provide significant operational advantages within the context of BC and TDF operations. The information provided through this RFI is intended to provide insight on current and future technologies that the Government could possibly leverage for adaptation and utilization in a TSS program of record.
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. The Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. The Government would prefer that any submissions be non-proprietary in order to maximize potential use by the Government. Nonetheless, both proprietary and non-proprietary information will be accepted and the safeguarding of proprietary information will be in accordance with all applicable government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.<br />The Government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.<br />(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.<br />(b) Responses to this RFI do not constitute a proposal and will be treated as information only.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to engage with respondent(s) if additional information and/or clarification are deemed necessary.<br />Responses to this notice are not offers and the Government cannot accept them to form a binding contract or agreement. The Government will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative because of this RFI. The Government will not return any RFI responses. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation to the TSS program.<br />2.0 BACKGROUND<br />The current TSS CDD v1.5 identifies the following capability gaps: a critical need for a lightweight, ground-based surveillance and security system that includes pan/tilt/zoom controls and semi-autonomous monitoring; early warning; Brigade level and below units lack sufficient resources to perform decisive action operations while simultaneously performing its inherent responsibility for its own Base Security Operations during decisive action operations leading to degraded capability of its primary mission; Theater and below elements of the Army lack the ability to provide an enduring persistent surveillance capability for forward operating bases (FOB). The lack of enduring persistent surveillance leaves these locations vulnerable to threats; Corps and below forces lack the ability to provide an organic force responsible for the protection of critical installations and facilities security in support of the wide area security mission. The TSS will integrate current research efforts and COTS technologies with the latest IBD and Detention doctrine and training to support defense, security, and protection operations. Based on the DoD Critical Infrastructure (CI) Detect, Assess, Warn, Defend, and Recovery (DAWDR) functional framework, TSS will provide surveillance and detection to support integrated and shared understanding of the operational environment, it will directly support the Detect, Assess, and Warn functions; and enable and inform the capabilities and tasks associated with the Defend and Recovery functions. TSS core capabilities fit in the short to mid-range level of response to the following threat categories:<br />1) Surface and subterranean (SbT) threats.<br />2) Direct fire threats.<br />3) Non-specific threats - This also includes detection of threat personnel positioning themselves or equipment against friendly forces. In addition, this covers threat attempts at intrusion and surveillance capabilities.<br />The TSS Node is designed with the ability to be employed in either a stand-alone network configuration or integrated with other IBD and FP systems such as the Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System (Expeditionary) (G-BOSS(E)) and the Integrated Ground Security and Surveillance Response Capability (IGSSR-C). The primary link between these systems is the Control Station (CS) (referenced as the Operator Station in the TSS Capability Document (CDD)). The CS used is dependent on the network configuration; a Portable CS (PCS) is used when operating on a closed restricted network, or a Fixed CS (FCS) is used when operating on an external network as part of the IBD. CS operation is managed by the IGSSR-C software. <br />The technologies should be capable of providing a rapidly deployable perimeter security and surveillance capability with day/night imaging functionality and accurate intrusion detection sensors to identify surface and subsurface intrusions/activities that indicate attempts to breach base perimeter or a detention facility (in or out). Additionally, secure network capabilities are core in establishing communication between emplaced edge-devices (i.e., sensors) and distribution of surveillance and ground-based security information to the TSS Operator responsible for executing C2 of the system. Lastly, power generation and source capabilities as well as the capability to handle regulation of available power (either external or internal) to the TSS Node is paramount in ensuring the system maintains the 24/7 operational cycle without disruption due to a power loss.<br />Specific technologies targeted for investigation and development are: : (1) systems working in the visible and infrared (near, mid wave and long wave) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum to enable automatic detection and classification/identification of ground and surface targets given degraded atmospheric and environmental conditions; (2) a low-weight, man-portable, ground surveillance radar system (antenna and transceiver) to detect vehicular and individual movements targets with improved tracking accuracy/quality; (3) secure wireless transmission communication networks for wide-area sensor employment (i.e., sensor nodes) in order to receive C2 and forward sensor information to an operator control station; and (4) energy storage units (i.e., battery box) coupled with intelligent power management and control systems capable of supply source monitoring, synchronization, and load compensation based on system demand. At a minimum, identified technologies and capabilities shall be modular/expandable, using open interfaces, allowing sensors and componentry from other suppliers to be integrated into a scalable, modular surveillance and detection FP system.<br />3.0 PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this RFI is to gather information and establish knowledge of current state of the art and future technologies that the government can leverage to meet the capabilities described in paragraph 4. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the Government is interested in information defined in paragraph 4 and the abilities to meet the parameters and measures listing in the attached Technical Attributes Table.<br />4.0 CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />Currently TSS is in a pre-Milestone B acquisition phase with an approved Capabilities Development Document (CDD). Although some individual near-term sensor and infrastructure technologies associated with establishing surveillance and detection capability are considered mature, integration into a cohesive, interoperable FP system using self-contained power and secure network communications across worldwide deployed environments to meet demanding FP mission applications is challenging. Therefore, PdM FPS is canvassing industry to assist in identification of readily available commercial based solutions, innovative technologies, and novel concepts applicable to TSS that will expand system autonomous surveillance system functionality and enhance target detection and recognition performance at designated ranges. Additionally, stable, flexible, reliable and renewable, tactical power capabilities provide the life-line to TSS and supporting infrastructure to meet mission and duty-cycle demands for 24/7 operational coverage.

<CONTACT>DHA Industry Partner Network (IPN) Team, Email dha.ncr.acquisition.mbx.dha-ipn@mail.mil
<DESC><br />TITLE: Request for Information (RFI): Department of Defense&nbsp;and&nbsp;Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Staffing Services (DoD VA HCSS)<br /><br /><br />INTRODUCTION:<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued by the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Component Acquisition Executive J-4. The intent of this RFI is to research the marketplace and obtain companies' feedback on the capabilities available in industry to supplement clinical operations in Department of Defense (DoD) Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and/or the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) medical facilities within the Continental United States (CONUS) and its territories. For these requirements, the Government utilizes Product Service Code (PSC) Category "Q" in the Federal Procurement Data System. Specifically, Q201 through Q527 as defined in the Product and Service Codes Manual (https://www.fpds.gov/downloads/top_requests/PSC_Manual_FY2016_Oct1_2015.pdf). This requirement will not include consultants, advisors or subject matter experts, housekeeping, facility maintenance, information technology or food services. <br /><br />BACKGROUND:<br />The DHA has partnered with the VA to determine the feasibility of a joint strategic solution for the delivery of integrated, high-quality health care services to 19 million beneficiaries. Both agencies operate medical facilities in the United States and its territories as shown below. The facilities include clinics (stand alone, non-bedded facilities), community hospitals, and medical centers that are staffed by DoD, VA, military personnel, civilian employees and contractor staff. The contracted staff is comprised of numerous clinical occupations. These include health care providers/workers in the following broad functional categories supporting inpatient and outpatient facilities: Ancillary, Dental, Nursing and Physician Services. See attachment for details on the types of facilities by customer.
<p>A listing of DOD facilities by state is included as an attachment along with a summary and website link to the Veterans Integrated Service Networks. These may be helpful to interested companies as they complete the 56-question survey.<br /><br />GOALS OF THE RFI:<br />&bull; Determine industry practice variations for acquisitions of similar services, duration and performance location. <br />&bull; Determine industry capabilities to fulfill DoD/VA combined requirement..<br />&bull; Verify whether small business is a viable partner for this program.<br />&bull; Confirm appropriate NAICS and size standard.<br />&bull; Determine if DoD/VA requirements and contract structure aligns with industry practices.<br />&bull; Identify industry leaders<br />&bull; Assess competition</p>
<p>The RFI is designed to demonstrate industry capabilities for DoD VA HCSS. Survey information captured from this RFI will only be used for market research and participation is voluntary.</p>
<p>ACRONYMNS/DEFINITIONS:<br />Terms are often misunderstood due to the ambiguous nature of complex health care requirements coupled with military jargon. Therefore, the following should be considered prior to completing the survey. If needed, further definitions clarifying intent are included in the actual survey questions.</p>
<p>1. Ancillary Services: Services provided by qualified workers who deliver patient treatment or assist in the provision of patient treatment including, but not limited to, audiologists, clinical laboratory personnel, dietitians, mid-level providers (i.e., nurse practitioners, physician assistants), occupational therapists, pharmacists, physical therapists, podiatrists, radiology support, respiratory therapists, speech pathologists, and clinical support staff such as medical assistants.</p>
<p>2. Clinical Services: Direct care of acute and chronic medical conditions. This includes all services involved in assessment, diagnosis, treatment, patient movement, advice, recommendations and area/equipment preparation.</p>
<p>3. Deliverable: Anything that can be physically delivered, which may include, but is not limited to, meeting minutes, staff rosters, key personnel or routine reports.</p>
<p>4. Dental Services: Services provided by qualified workers who deliver dental care including, but not limited to, general dentists and specialty dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants and dental lab technicians.</p>
<p>5. Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Employee: For this RFI, a worker is considered a full-time employee if they perform 1920 or more hours annually.</p>
<p>6. Health Care Support Services (HCSS): This RFI is for HCSS which is defined as personnel who provide clinical care in ancillary, dental, nursing or physician service areas (see those definitions). This does not include personnel whose duties are primarily administrative or clerical in nature, or provide maintenance or security services.</p>
<p>7. Health support service: As defined in Joint Publication 1-02, DoD Definitions and Abbreviations, "All services performed, provided or arranged to promote, improve, conserve, or restore the mental or physical well-being of personnel. These services include, but are not limited to, the management of health services resources, such as manpower, monies, and facilities; preventative and curative health measures; evacuation of the wounded, injured, or sick; selection of the medically fit and disposition of the medically unfit; blood management; medical supply, equipment and maintenance thereof; combat stress control; and medical, dental, veterinary, laboratory, optometric, nutrition therapy, and medical intelligence services."</p>
<p>8. Temporary Services (a.k.a., Locum Tenens): A worker filling a position or temporarily covering for another worker for a period of performance of 13 weeks, but less than one year in duration.</p>

<p>14. Medical Facility: A DoD or VA hospital or clinic to include dental clinics as well as satellite areas such as standalone clinics and medical operations (i.e., health and wellness centers). The medical facility may be a clinic, hospital, or medical center. Clinics are outpatient facilities offering primary care or simple specialty care (i.e., routine exams, tests, treatments). A clinic may be a stand-alone site or a satellite of a larger clinic, hospital, or medical center, to include patient centered medical homes. Hospitals offer more complex, resource-intensive secondary care (i.e., inpatient care, surgery under anesthesia) and primary care. Medical centers offer tertiary (i.e., sophisticated diagnosis/treatment of any ailment), secondary, and primary care, hospital services, preventive services, blood bank, and other services.</p>
<p>15. Privileging: The process whereby the privileging authority, upon recommendation from the credentials committee, grants individuals the authority and responsibility for making independent decisions to diagnosis, initiate, alter, or terminate a regimen of medical or dental care.<br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:<br />The intent of this RFI is to conduct Market Research in accordance with FAR 10.002 and FAR 15.201.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT - THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) PART 10, MARKET RESEARCH. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), and nothing shall be construed here or through the RFI process to commit or obligate the Government to further action because of this RFI. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. The Government is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. There is no solicitation available and requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.
<p><br />This notice is intended as market research to determine the availability and capability of potential sources for the services described here and to assist in determining an acquisition strategy. Any information submitted by respondents to this notice is strictly voluntary. The Government does not intend to make an award based on responses to this notice.</p>
<p>Contractors responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information. The information collected through this process is market research as described by FAR 2.101 and in accordance with FAR 10.002. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>
<p>Note the following information is provided for INFORMATIONAL purposes only.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is issuing this notice on behalf of the Foreign Payment Practice within the Large Business &amp; International (LB&amp;I) Division as a means of conducting market research to identify the availability of a software program that reviews data intended to be reported on an IRS Form 1042-S (Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding) and identifies data that is inconsistent, or potentially inconsistent, with the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p>In general, Withholding Agents must file an information return on Form 1042-S to report amounts paid from U.S. sources to foreign persons. A Withholding Agent is any person, U.S. or foreign, that has control, receipt, or custody of amounts that are subject to the rules under Chapter 3 or Chapter 4 of the Internal Revenue Code. Based on 2016 numbers, approximately 3,500 withholding agents filed over 90% of the Forms 1042-S received by the IRS.</p>
<p>The Form 1042-S collects a variety of codes and information to help the IRS determine whether the correct amount has been withheld under the law. The IRS Foreign Payment Practice would like to identify the availability of a software program that Withholding Agents could use to review Form 1042-S electronic data before submitting it to the IRS. The program would produce reports listing identifiable reporting errors and potential errors. See Attachment 1 for examples of such reports.</p>
<p>Depending upon the availability, cost, and capabilities of the program, the IRS would consider use of the program when conducting compliance examinations. Use of the program by Withholding Agents as part of their due diligence could be be considered a mitigating factor in penalty determinations.</p>
<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION - Vendors who believe they can provide such a program to Withholding Agents should respond by indicating their interest and providing sufficient information to demonstrate a capability to provide the program. Responses should include a capability statement as well as a summary of the firm's experience providing this type of service. The information should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirement by providing clear and comprehensive information supporting the company's qualifications. <br />In addition to demonstrating your capability, each response must also include the following information:</p>
<p>(1) Company Name, Address, CAGE Code and DUNS Number</p>
<p>(2) Point of Contact Name, Telephone Number and E-mail Address</p>
<p>(3) Information Regarding Existing Government Purchasing Vehicles - Vendors should list any existing Government purchasing vehicles they hold that could be applicable to this requirement (e.g. GSA Schedule Contracts, Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), etc.). Vendors should provide the name of the vehicle (NASA SEWP, NITAAC CIO, VETS 2, Alliant/Alliant SB, GSA Schedule 70, etc.), a brief overview of the scope and their contract number.</p>
<p>(5) Pricing and Associated Costs (FOR BUDGETING PURPOSES ONLY) - Provide a general overall price range for these services and/or supplies based on your offering and identify main cost drivers, or the biggest expenses for providing these types of services and/or supplies?</p>
<p>(4) Questions/Comments - Vendors may include questions, comments or other feedback regarding this RFI and the content of Attachment #1 in their responses. The IRS is not obligated to provide responses or update this RFI in any manner however vendor feedback may be of assistance in refining any future requirements and determining an acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>RESPONSES - Responses to this notice shall be submitted electronically to Sandra.R.Anderson@irs.gov no later than<strong> 4:00 pm, Friday, November 30, 2018 EST.&nbsp; </strong>Responses shall not exceed 10 pages and shall not contain any brochures, advertising or any other type of extraneous, graphic literature or documents that have not been requested and are not relevant or essential in demonstrating the company's ability to provide the required services. Vendors may provide links to relevant websites, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Vendors may submit questions regarding this notice however, the IRS does not guarantee that any responses will be provided. Questions shall be submitted by e-mail. Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The Government shall not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with all applicable Government regulations. All documentation shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>Vendors shall use the reference number IRS-1042-S Data Integrity Program-2018 in the subject line of their response as well as in the subject line of any other e-mail correspondence referencing this notice.</p>
<p>** THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT RESPOND TO PHONE CALLS.**</p>

<DESC>Objective of this RFI<br />Based on its experience as a user of cloud services and through the Big Data Project, NOAA is seeking one or more contractual arrangements that would allow it to place a significant portion of its data in one or more cloud platforms, for&nbsp;use by the public. Such use could be in the form of egress or cloud-based processing and analytics. NOAA seeks to host data on cloud platforms in a sustained, operational manner to enable easier discoverability and access, allowing the untapped value of NOAA's data to be realized through the generation of novel products and services. NOAA is also interested in learning how these data stores may complement and enable future NOAA mission-related cloud usage, including but not limited to high-performance computing and product generation.<br /><br />In order to inform the future direction of the BDP, this RFI seeks direct input and feedback from all users of the data on their experience accessing NOAA's open data through one or more of the five BDP Collaborators' cloud platforms. In general, NOAA's OCIO is requesting information as to whether accessing the data in this manner is beneficial, and if so, the details on these benefits. Input is requested from the public, academia, researchers, and industry on the value of the access to the data through the Collaborators and the value of providing open access to the data. In addition, information is requested that particularly pertains to any business growth or contributions to new business services or new technology and scientific development related to accessing NOAA's data. NOAA will use this feedback to: 1) understand end user needs; and 2) understand the impact of NOAA data in the marketplace. Responses from this RFI will be compiled and made publicly available.<br />

<DESC>This Sources Sought has been updated to include Industry questions and Government responses to those questions.  The response date for this Sources Sought has been adjusted to October 17, 2018.&nbsp;
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Industry Questions:&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>1.  Is the plan to have the Loadmaster CWS mount in the same place as the current seating arrangement?  If so, can a few pictures be provided of the current mounting location so that an evaluation can be made whether we can accommodate this notice or not?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>2.  This solicitation appears to be a build-to-print contract where the manufacturing drawings are part of the TDP.  Can you tell us whether the TDP is complete; that is, does it fully specify all parts adequately for manufacturing purposes?  It appears that the solicitation would not allow for non-recurring engineering if needed to determine information that the drawings do not provide.  My company is a small business with experience in seat design and manufacturing.  This information would affect whether we are able to bid.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Government Responses:&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>1.  No, the existing observer seat attaches to the paratroop door.  While the seat will be in the same location, the mounting location has changed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>2.  NAVAIR is looking for a build-to-print item, per the completed TDP, which will be provided with the solicitation.</div>

<div>Synopsis:<br /><br /></div>
<div>Original Synopsis: October 16, 2017<br /><br /></div>
<div>Broad Agency Announcement, November 6, 2017 as:&nbsp;<br /><br /></div>
<div>BAA 18 100-SOL-00003<br /><br /></div>
<div>This Broad Agency Announcement combines versions of three related Broad Agency Announcements (BARDA CBRN BAA, BARDA Influenza BAA, and BARDA SST BAA), which have been re-issued annually:</div>
<div><br />BAA-16-100-SOL-00001</div>
<div>BAA-16-100-SOL-00002</div>
<div>BAA-16-100-SOL-00003<br /><br /></div>
<div>The Office of Acquisitions Management, Contracts, and Grants (AMCG) on behalf of the Office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) solicits proposals for the advanced research and development of medical countermeasures (MCM) for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) agents, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases that threaten the U.S. civilian population. BARDA anticipates that Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities awarded under this BAA will serve to advance candidate medical countermeasures towards licensure or approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This BAA will also serve to advance the knowledge and scientific understanding of candidates&rsquo; platform technologies, modeling and forecasting, and visual analytics.</div>
<div><br />BARDA encourages the advanced research, development, and acquisition of medical countermeasures such as vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, as well as innovative approaches to meet the threat of CBRN agents, emerging infectious diseases, and pandemic influenza. These efforts are in support of the preparedness mission and priorities of the HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) articulated in the 2016 PHEMCE Implementation Plan for CBRN Threats. The Implementation Plan is located on the ASPR website: https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/mcm/phemce/Documents/2016-phemce-sip.pdf.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act Pub.

No. 113-5, (PAHPRA: &nbsp; http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-113publ5/pdf/PLAW-113publ5.pdf) authorizes BARDA to (i) conduct ongoing searches for, and support calls for, potential qualified countermeasures and qualified pandemic or epidemic products; (ii) direct and coordinate the countermeasure and product advanced research and development activities of the Department of Health and Human Services; (iii) establish strategic initiatives to accelerate countermeasure and product advanced research and development (which may include advanced research and development for purposes of fulfilling requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or section 351 of this Act) and innovation in such areas as the Secretary may identify as priority unmet need areas; and (iv) award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, and enter into other transactions, for countermeasure and product advanced research and development.</div>
<div><br />Areas of Interest:&nbsp;<br /><br /></div>
<div>The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit proposals that focus on one or more of the following areas of interest as listed here and further described in Part I.</div>

<DESC>This notice constitutes a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This announcement seeks information from industry and will ONLY be used for preliminary planning purposes. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS RFI. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. The Government will not pay for any response expenses. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government is specifically interested in technologies, methodologies, ideas and solutions for the construction of The Rio Puerto Nuevo Project in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The information received will be used to support a market analysis for the project.
<p>The Rio Puerto Nuevo (RPN) and its tributaries covers a highly developed area of the San Juan Metropolitan area of Puerto Rico. Intense development in the drainage basin has altered the natural drainage patterns, significantly increased the runoff water, and restricted the flows in the flood plain. The existing channels and many bridges are undersized and in poor conditions. Development extends to the banks of the channels and hinders flood flows. Floods greater than the two-year event cause extensive damage. Flood waters from the Rio Puerto Nuevo represent a continuous threat to a significant portion of the population of over one million residents and to the economic activity of the San Juan metropolitan area. The Rio Puerto Nuevo Flood Control Project drains a highly developed 25 square mile basin and is designed to provide a 100 year flood protection for the areas adjacent to the Puerto Nuevo Channel and its tributaries, specifically by the following constructible features:</p>
<p>&bull; 11.2 miles of channel improvements to the existing Rio Puerto Nuevo and Rio Piedras and to five tributaries: Margarita, Josefina, Do&ntilde;a Ana, Buena Vista, and Guaracanal. The project plan includes 1.66 miles of bullheaded trapezoidal channel and 9.54 miles of concrete rectangular channel.</p>
<p>&bull; Two baffle pier stilling areas.</p>
<p>&bull; Two high velocity flow junctions with tributary streams Buena Vista Diversion Channel and Guaracanal Channel.</p>
<p>&bull; Two upstream debris basins with side-overflow spillways.</p>
<p>&bull; Replacement of 17 bridges (15 highway and 2 pedestrians).</p>
<p>&bull; Modification of 8 bridges.</p>
<p>&bull; Construction of 5 new bridges (3 highway and 2 pedestrians.</p>
<p>&bull; Kennedy Expressway and De Diego Expressway Bridge Modifications.</p>
<p>&bull; Sidewalks and bike paths for recreation.</p>
<p>RESPONSES</p>
<p>Industry is asked to provide a written response addressing the following objectives or questions:</p>
<p>1. This program consists of multiple construction projects. The total estimated value of the entire program is approximately $1,000,000,000.00.</p>
<p>2. What is your maximum bonding capacity?</p>
<p>3. What experience do you have working in Puerto Rico and how would you handle the logistical challenges working in this location (i.e. labor, material/supplies for construction, and lodging etc.)?</p>

<DESC>1. INTRODUCTION
<div><br />1.1 This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Department of the Army ("DA") will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) or take any procurement action in this matter in the future. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Further, neither DA nor the United States will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing information in response to this RFI. See Section 4 for requested information.</div>
<div><br />&nbsp;1.2 Humphreys Engineer Center (HEC) is a 583-acre U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Civil Works property.  It is managed by and home to the Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA) which provides essential, integrated operational support to the Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (HQUSACE) and other USACE activities; ensures continuing viability of the HEC infrastructure; and executes unique USACE delegated responsibilities.  It is also home to USACE and non-USACE tenants for which HECSA supplies a wide range of installation support.  The property is adjacent to, but not part of, Fort Belvoir.
<p>1.3 Fort Belvoir provides services to more than 245,000 military, defense civilians, retirees and families.  It is home to more than 145 distinct mission partners including, U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command, the U.S. Army Cyber Command and elements of ten other Army Major Commands.  Other tenants include 19 different agencies and direct reporting units of the Department of Army as well 8 elements of the U.S. Army Reserve and the Army National Guard.  Fort Belvoir also contains a community hospital. The majority of Fort Belvoir's electrical load is supplied by a substation located on HEC.</p>
<p>1.4 Project Overview: DA is interested in gathering information on the feasibility of seeking competitive proposals from private, public, or not-for-profit entities interested in leasing land at HEC to design, build, own, operate and maintain a fast-ramping, firm capacity, and black-start capable electrical generating asset.  The asset must have a minimum capacity of at least 60 MW, and must be capable of operating in is landed mode (hereinafter the "Project").&nbsp;</p>
<p>During normal grid operations, the electricity generated from the Project would be sold by the Lessee to a third party off-taker selected by the Lessee.  Instead of cash rent for the lease, the Lessee would provide in-kind consideration equal to or greater than the fair market value of the lease interest, in the form of contingency power and the requisite infrastructure to enable the provision of contingency power independent of the commercial electrical grid.  Although the Project would be located at HEC, both HEC and Fort Belvoir would receive contingency power. See below for further details.</p>
<p>1.5 Contemplated Lease: DA anticipates the Project will proceed in two lease phases.  The first phase will involve a study period to determine the impact and feasibility of the Project on the high-voltage electric transmission system managed by PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), the regional transmission organization.  For this first phase, the Army would issue a short-term lease up to approximately 28 contiguous acres of land within HEC boundaries for up to three years to complete all studies required by PJM.   In return for the lease of this land, the Lessee would be required to provide consideration not less than the fair market value of the lease interest.  Instead of cash rent, the Lessee will provide in-kind consideration ("IKC") in the form of an electricity bill credit or other similar non-cash consideration.</p>
<p>The second phase would include a long-term lease of approximately six (6) contiguous acres of land (down-selected from the study area) within HEC boundaries for the construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of the Project (the "Parcel").  The duration of the lease must be for at least 25 years.  Fort Belvoir would not contribute Army real property to the Project.  Additional land would be identified at HEC and made available for a laydown area during construction.  In return for the lease of this land, the Lessee would be required to provide consideration not less than the fair market value of the lease interest.  Instead of cash rent, the Lessee will provide in-kind consideration ("IKC") in the form of contingency power and the requisite infrastructure to provide contingency power to HEC and Fort Belvoir.  The IKC provided by the Lessee must enable HEC and Fort Belvoir to island operations from the external electrical grid and continue to receive sufficient continuous electricity to operate the critical load for a minimum of 14 days.  No cash consideration will be accepted for either lease phase.  Both short-term and long-term leases will be executed in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2667.</p>
<p>1.6 Contemplated Project Operation</p>
<p>Normal Operations: Under DA's proposed Project concept, during the times that HEC and Fort Belvoir are capable of receiving sufficient continuous electricity from the commercial electrical grid ("normal operations"), all power generated by the Project would go to the local electrical grid to be sold by the Lessee to a third-party off-taker.  The Lessee would be solely responsible for identifying and securing off-take agreements, and financing, constructing, and operating any additional infrastructure required to facilitate the off-take. During normal operations, DA will continue to purchase electricity from its local regulated service provider, Dominion Virginia Power (DVP), and will not consume or purchase any electricity generated from the Project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contingency Operations:   During grid outages or disruptions and validated threat scenarios (collectively "Contingency Operations"), the Lessee will provide to HEC and Belvoir electricity generated from the Project.  The Lessee will provide the infrastructure necessary to enable HEC and Fort Belvoir to receive and use such contingency power independent of the commercial grid (in "islanded mode"). The Lessee must provide HEC and Fort Belvoir with full and continuous operational capability to meet the minimum required load during Contingency Operations for a minimum of fourteen (14) days in islanded mode. For the purposes of this RFI, the term "validated threat" shall mean a situation in which the Army determines there is a threat to mission continuity and plans to electrically island the installation to ensure continuity of mission in the best interest of national security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the purposes of the RFI, HEC and Fort Belvoir's critical load that must be satisfied by contingency power is estimated to be approximately 45 MW peak, 32 MW average. Necessary infrastructure required to interconnect the Project to HEC and Fort Belvoir's existing electrical distribution system and enable the provision of electricity during islanded mode may include controls, and distribution equipment, such as backup generators, energy storage, electric utility grid enhancements, microgrid controls, and other technologies determined necessary by Lessee to provide the indicated energy resilience requirements to HEC and Fort Belvoir.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.7  DA envisions that development of the Project would entail a well-planned and coordinated endeavor to utilize the Parcel in a manner that would be compatible with HEC and Fort Belvoir's ongoing mission-related activities as described in 1.2 and 1.3, above.  The Lessee would be required to comply with HEC and Fort Belvoir's anti-terrorism force protection ("AT/FP") and operations security requirements, as well as DA requirements for cybersecurity, point of origin, and Buy American Act requirements.  DA will satisfy any required environmental studies for the Project, to include National Environmental Policy Act documentation.</p>
<p>1.8 DA intends to use the results of this RFI to determine the feasibility and level of interest for the Project as proposed by DA.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>2.1 Location.  HEC and Fort Belvoir are located in the greater Washington, D.C. area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.2.1 Infrastructure. The Parcel is contained entirely within HEC.  The Project may consider integration of the Parcel with HEC by either utilizing the existing infrastructure on HEC or by constructing new infrastructure to service the Parcel.  There will be no interconnection of generated electricity to the DA-owned infrastructure, with the exception of interconnections necessary to provide generated electrical energy to DA in the event of Contingency Operations as required for the Project.  The following infrastructure elements should be considered:</p>
<p>a. Utilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) The Project should connect to the Belvoir substation located at HEC. The Belvoir substation has two incoming 34.5-kilovolt (kV) commercial feeds. The on-site distribution system is currently a radial system.  Power is transmitted initially to Fort Belvoir and HEC via underground corridors.  These corridors exit into substations for distribution to the different areas of the installation. From these substations, there is a mix of overhead and underground distribution pathways.</p>
<p>(2) The Lessee would be required to plan for providing utilities and infrastructure needs to the Parcel without disrupting current operations at HEC and Fort Belvoir.  The Lessee may have access to DA utilities but would be required to pay for such utilities and enter into a contract with the appropriate installation.  All energy generated from this Project, except any electrical energy provided to DA during Contingency Operations, must be delivered to off-taker(s) via either overhead or underground electric distribution lines, as agreed to by HEC and Fort Belvoir, which interconnect to substations not located on DA land, at the Lessee's expense.</p>
<p>b. Physical/Operational Security. The Lessee would be required to incorporate applicable installation physical and operational security measures, such as the HECSA and Fort Belvoir's AT/FP requirements discussed below.  In addition, the Lessee would be required to provide fencing to secure the Parcel and/or any associated improvements.</p>
<p>(1) Although leases entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2667 are not subject to either the Federal Acquisition Regulation or the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, the Secretary of the Army has determined, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2667(a), that the inclusion of the mandatory requirements set forth in the list contained in Attachment C ("DA Mandatory Requirements") promote the national defense, and therefore would be required in the lease agreement.  These DA Mandatory Requirements would be part of the lease agreement, and thus would be binding upon the selected lessee, or any subsequently approved lessee successors in interest or assigns.</p>
<p>(2) As noted above, the Lessee will be required to comply with specific requirements for AT/FP and operations security as established by HECSA and Fort Belvoir, and which may be amended from time to time.  Current antiterrorism and operations security requirements are included in Attachment D ("Current Anti-Terrorism and Operations Security Requirements").</p>
<p>(3) The Lessee would also be required to comply with and implement, as applicable, specific requirements for cybersecurity as established by DA, and as may be amended from time to time. All network-enabled equipment attached to the distribution system may be required to meet all risk management framework (RMF) requirements and achieve authority to operate (ATO) status as part of the commissioning process, if applicable.  Current cybersecurity and RMF requirements are included in Attachment E ("Current Cybersecurity Requirements").</p>
<p>c. Design Considerations. The Lessee would be required to comply with applicable HEC and Fort Belvoir Appearance Plans, Development Plans, and be context sensitive with the system construction. (i.e., blend with the surrounding area).  Additional lay-down area of approximately 15 acres could be provided within the Installation to be utilized during construction.</p>
<p>d. Interconnection. DVP is the local electric utility provider for HEC and Fort Belvoir.  The Lessee would be responsible at its sole cost for any studies required to connect the Project electric generation and energy storage to off-taker(s) and any associated fees for utility interconnection, including the cost of entering into a three (3) year lease with DA for completing the required PJM interconnection study.  Consideration equal to or greater than the fair market value of the lease interest must be provided in-kind during this three (3) year period; cash rent cannot be accepted.</p>
<p>3. RESPONDING TO THIS RFI</p>
<p>3.1 The following persons (including entities) responding to this RFI are ineligible to participate in this RFI if they are: (a) any person that has been debarred or suspended from doing business with DA; (b) any person that is listed on the most current "Excluded Parties List System" published at https://www.sam.gov/, as updated from time to time; (c) any person who poses a security or safety risk, as determined by the Secretary of State, including but not limited to any person who either represents a country, or is a member of or provides political, financial, or military support to a group, that is listed in the most current "Patterns of Global Terrorism" report issued by the Secretary of State in compliance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 2656f, available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402 and also available at http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/index.htm; (d) governments of a terrorist country; and (e) any person who is subject to a criminal indictment or information for a felony in any U.S. court.  DA reserves the right to require any participant in the Project to confirm that it is not ineligible under the foregoing criteria.</p>
<p>3.2 RFI responses must include:</p>
<p>a. Organization name, legal form of organization (i.e., corporation, limited liability company), the state where it is organized or incorporated, and state(s) where authorized to do business;</p>
<p>b. Description of organization capability and relevant past performance;&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. Name of the primary point of contact for the response;</p>
<p>d. Business title;</p>

<p>4. DA REQUESTED INFORMATION</p>
<p>4.1 DA is requesting responses to the following questions from entities interested in developing the above described Project at HEC:&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Please explain your organization's approach to financing the Project including a description of the organization's strategy to obtain financing, including anticipated costs, discussion of the risks, etc.  In addition please provide responses to the following:</p>
<p>(1) What would be the proposed sources of funding (i.e., aggregate amount and type)?</p>
<p>(2) What is the estimated amount of time needed to obtain financing?</p>
<p>b. Does your organization see an off-take market for the energy produced by the Project, and if so, what is the likely timing for entering into off-take agreements?</p>
<p>c. How would your organization ensure that HEC and Fort Belvoir would receive sufficient secure, uninterruptable power to operate the specified critical load for a minimum of fourteen (14) days during Contingency Operations? Is the approach of providing such power independent of the commercial electrical grid (see Para 1.6) feasible without additional DA expenditure?&nbsp;</p>
<p>d. Describe how long it would take to complete the construction of the project after execution of the long-term lease.  Describe major milestones (e.g., permits, off-take agreements, etc.), their timing, and any potential issues or impediments.</p>
<p>e. Describe the proposed business concept for the Project, including:  (i) approximate size, acreage required, and anticipated generating capacity of the system; (ii) recommended technology; and (iii) proposed IKC that would provide contingency power for HEC and Fort Belvoir.</p>
<p>f. If DA issued an RFP for the Project, would your organization submit a responsive proposal? Responsive proposals to an RFP would be expected to address, at a minimum: (i) size, acreage required, and generating capacity of the system; (ii) off-take and/or ancillary services arrangement; (iii) transmission access and capacity capabilities and constraints; (iv) a discussion of the economic viability of the proposed approach; (v) use of the electrical generating asset to provide IKC in the form of contingency power for HEC and Fort Belvoir; and (vi) description of approach to project financing.</p>
<p>g. If the lease were awarded to your organization, would your organization be prepared to pay for all studies and fees related to the PJM interconnection requirements without DA reimbursement?&nbsp;</p>
<p>h. If your organization were selected to develop the Project, would your organization be prepared to enter into a separate three (3) year lease at HEC to satisfy PJM's site control requirement for the PJM interconnection study?  If so, what type of IKC can your organization provide in lieu of cash rent for the 3-year lease?</p>
<p>i. If your organization were selected to develop the Project, would your organization need access to the Parcel for site preparation prior to the end of the above-mentioned three (3) lease?  If so, what type of site preparation would you anticipate engaging in and for what purposes?</p>

This is to confirm all invitations have been extended and no further consideration or invites will be granted for participation in this Industry Day.
This is market research and the VA technical team has limited time so they had to make choices in who to meet with.  Not participating in the industry event will not preclude participation if a solicitation is released.
Also to clarify, future Industry Visits with the TAC can be scheduled with Nicholas Racioppi, Nicholas.Racioppi@va.gov or Marc Savare, Marc.Savare@va.gov.  They conduct regular industry visits each week to go over who the TAC is and what we buy, but they do not get involved with individual procurements.

<DESC>This is an award notice for a contract to provide medical transcription services for VISN 21 of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  This contract was awarded as a sole source contract to America s Pride.
This is a short term period of performance of only four months.  The long-term goal is to issue a competitive RFQ but more time is needed to conduct a competitive procurement.  This award was made under the statutory authority of 38 USC 8127(b), which allows the VA to make a sole source award to a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.  The goal is still to issue a competitive RFQ.  Interested vendors are encouraged to review FedBizOpps for an upcoming RFQ for the medical transcription services.  
The point of contract is Michael Hodahkwen.  Phone (916) 923-4567.  Email michael.hodahkwen@va.gov.

The awarded contract will address the requirements of the Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) within the Office of Acquisition Program Management (OAPM), and is for supplies and services for which the Government has solicited and negotiated with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.<br /><br />The Contract Award information is as follows: <br />Contract Award Number: 70T04018C9CAP1058<br />Total Contract Value: $58,661,536.00<br />Contract Award Date: September 27, 2018<br />Vendor: Reveal Imaging Technologies, Inc., 10260 Campus Point Drive, San Diego, CA 92121-1522.<br />
<p>The Justification for the Sole-Source contract is attached. This Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been reviewed and approved in accordance with established TSA procedures and is hereby published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.305. Any and all redactions in this published document (that is, language marked out or deleted) have been identified and confirmed by the Government as contractor proprietary information which the Government must protect from unauthorized disclosure. As the Government's intent to acquire using other than full and open competition was previously published on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps) and all public comments considered at that time, the Government does not intend to respond further concerning this publication</p>
