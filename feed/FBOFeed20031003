<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Tamika Gray, Contract Specialist, (202) 273-6471
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) intends to solicit for VistA Imaging and Maintenance Support services.  This solicitation/procurement is a 100 percent (%) small business set-aside.  All qualified small businesses are encouraged to participate in this competition.  The estimated time frame for issuance of the solicitation is the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 (on or before 10/20/03).  At that time interested small businesses can access the solicitation on line at http://www.bos.oamm.va.gov and the Federal Business Opportunity System at http://www.fedbizopps.com.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541519, Other Computer Related Services; size standard $21 million.   Small businesses exploring teaming and subcontracting arrangements with other potential vendors (i.e. large businesses) should be aware that the proposed small business (serving as the prime contractor) shall complete at a minimum 51 percent (%) of the level of effort required to perform and complete the contract.  This presolicitation notice does not commit the VA to issuing a solicitation in the future.  No response to this announcement is elicited.  Background:  VA’s Chief Information Office introduced VistA in 1996.  VistA is a rich, automated environment that supports day-to-day operations at local VA health care facilities.  VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff.  VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.  The Decision Support System (DSS) and other national databases that might be derived from locally generated data lie outside the scope of VistA.  When development began on the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DCHP) in the early 1980s, information systems were in their infancy in VA medical facilities and emphasized primarily hospital-based activities.  DHCP grew rapidly and is used by many private and public health care facilities throughout the United States and the world.  Although, DHCP represented the total automation activity at most VA medical centers in 1985, DHCP is now only one part of the overall information resources at the local facility level.  VistA incorporates all of the benefits of DHCP as well as including the rich array of other information resources that are becoming vital to the day-to-day operations at the VA medical facilities.  It represents the culmination of DHCP’s evolution and metamorphosis into a new, open system, client-server based environment that takes full advantage of commercial solutions, including those provided by Internet technologies.  Place of Contract Performance:  Washington Metropolitan Area.  Set-aside Status:  100 Percent (%)Small Business Set-aside.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to issue a competitive solicitation, set aside for eligible small business concerns for Technical and Management Support (TAMS).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330 with a size standard of $23.0 million.  This support contract will provide planning, program management, and communications support to NETL's Federal project managers, product managers, policy analysts, public affairs officer, and researchers. This support will be primarily of a general nature, providing reviews and analyses of existing data and continuing ongoing tasks to provide assistance to NETL program and project areas.  As part of this support, the contractor will assist NETL personnel in planning programs, administrating programs and projects consistent with and in response to NETL-management and DOE/HQ direction, and communicating with stakeholders and the general public. These support services will be provided to NETL personnel at four locations in Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, Tulsa, OK, and Alaska.  It is expected that the core support personnel will be employed by a small business and that these personnel will primarily consist of qualified scientists, engineers, energy analysts, and public affairs specialists.  Most of the support personnel will physically be located at NETL sites, but the support contract will include provisions for short-term, off-site efforts when these are justified by cost, staff, or timing considerations. The contract to provide these technical and management support services will be performance-based.  The contract will include measurable performance standards that  will assure the timely performance of services or delivery of reports. Contract performance will be encouraged by incentives (e.g., award fee) and measured according to a performance evaluation plan. NETL has initiated an electronic reading room as part of the strategy to provide information that may benefit potential offerors in preparing their proposals.  The information is provided to assist the reader in gaining an enhanced understanding of the requirement.  The reading rooms are under construction and changes should be expected throughout this process and up to the issuance of the solicitation.  The reading rooms may be accessed at http://www.netl.doe.gov/business/solicit/ssc2003/index.html . A FOIA release version of the current contract has been posted to the electronic reading room.  Offerors requesting a FOIA copy of the current contract will be directed to the reading room to download it from that location.  Summary information, including the estimated range of dollar value, estimated FTE's, and anticipated type of contract are posted to the electronic reading room. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be made available for downloading from the IIPS Internet page in late fall (November), 2003.  The IIPS page is located at http://e-center.doe.gov. At this Internet site you will be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to download the solicitation, join the mailing list for the solicitation, and to submit a proposal.

<DESC>The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. The following document describes the Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) Services Contract for the renovation of the Warren E. Burger Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse, 316 Robert Street, in St. Paul, Minnesota. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and the option for Construction Phase Services. The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs). Project Summary: The W.E. Burger Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse was constructed in 1966.  The seven- story building provides 260,541 occupiable square feet.  The renovation project will increase the presence and meet the operating needs of the courts, upgrade the facility to U.S. Courts Design Guide standards, meet ADA requirements and improve security. Work items include creating a separate circulation system for the judges, prisoner, staff and public; security upgrades at the building entrance, new salleyport, new Special Proceedings Courtroom, and expansion of the court family functions.  Construction will be phased, as the building will be fully occupied, during the renovation.  It is anticipated that multiple bid packages may be developed.   Estimated optional construction phase cost range is $25,000,000 to $30,000,000. Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor: A Construction Manager as Constructor, or CMc, is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the planning, design, and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer and GSA's selected A-E firm, Teng & Associates, Inc., Chicago, IL, as well as other GSA consultants. (NOTE: No A-E contract has been negotiated or awarded at this time.) Proposal Submission Requirements: Proposals will be evaluated using a two-stage, advisory multi-step process (FAR 15.202). Stage I of the RFP will contain an explanation of the entire selection process, including the evaluation factors for Stage I and Stage II of the Request for Proposals (RFP). Under Stage I, offerors must submit information regarding the firm's qualifications, past performance, past experience, proposed personnel, experience with electronic project management (e-PM) and factors identified in the RFP. Submissions shall clearly address the rating factors identified in the Stage I RFP. The Government will evaluate Stage I of the RFP submissions to identify and advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors. The Government shall evaluate all responses in accordance with the criteria stated in Stage I of the RFP.  The Government shall advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. The Government shall advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. The Government shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their Stage I submissions, they may participate in Stage II of the acquisition. Offerors must submit a Detailed Project Management Plan, Oral Presentation, Price Proposals and Subcontracting Plans under Stage II of the RFP. All Stage II respondents shall provide a brief written narrative of their outreach efforts to utilize small disadvantaged and small women-owned businesses on this project. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum goals for all subcontracted work: 40% for Small Business (SB) which includes 2.5% for HUBZone Small Business (HZSB), 8% for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), 5% for Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), and 5% for Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) that includes 3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) for Fiscal Year 2003. An acceptable Subcontracting Plan shall be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business. (Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.) Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13. FAR Clause 52.219-4 - Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply. Offers from Small disadvantaged business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.12. FAR Clause 52.219-23 - Notice of Price Evaluation Adjustment for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns shall apply. The Stage II evaluation will be based on technical factors as well as price. The Government reserves the right to discussions. Pre-Proposal Conference: A Pre-Proposal conference will be held prior to Stage II submissions at the Warren E. Burger Federal Building & U.S. Courthouse, 316 Robert Street, St. Paul, MN 55101.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a contract on a sole-source basis to the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the University of Colorado to procure a Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) instrument and a corresponding pointing platform.  This procurement includes development of the TIM instrument requirements, instrument interface requirements, preliminary and detailed designs, instrument development, assembly and test.  The TIM has been designated to fly on the Glory mission, which is scheduled to launch in December 2006.  Delivery of the TIM instrument is expected in January 2006.   The TIM instrument is being included on the Glory mission to continue the measurement of Total Solar Irradiance, which is currently being measured on SORCE.  The corresponding pointing platform allows the instrument to be integrated into a nadir pointing, earth observatory to maintain the measurement accuracy of the TIM instrument consistent with the data attained through SORCE.   Inclusion of this instrument on the Glory mission will allow for necessary overlap of data availability between the SORCE and NPOESS missions. NASA/GSFC intends to procure the TIM instrument and pointing platform with LASP based upon 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source and 10 U.S.C.2304 (d)(1)(B), Unacceptable Delays.  Only LASP has the heritage to build, integrate, and test the TIM instrument to meet the scientific requirements and the accelerated Glory mission schedule.  LASP possesses unique knowledge and expertise, including flight heritage of the TIM instrument as a part of the NASA SORCE mission that was launched in January 2003.  However, companies that believe they can provide a TIM and pointing platform for the Glory mission without any detrimental impact to the existing instrument delivery and launch schedules should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  These capability statements will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this instrument procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses to the synopsis received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement on a full and open basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  See Note 22.  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL: http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nnotes.htm.   An Ombudsman has been appointed, See Internet Note “B”.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) supports a comprehensive program in all aspects of tuberculosis (TB) research (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/tuberculosis/ ), including the biology and physiology of the pathogen, host/pathogen interaction, host response to infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) animal models of infection and disease, as well as research leading to the development of improved vaccines, drugs and diagnostics.  To advance research in TB and accelerate development of novel vaccines, the NIAID is supporting the Tuberculosis Research Materials and Vaccine Testing Contract, currently awarded to Colorado State University (http://www.cvmbs.colostate.edu/microbiology/tb/top.htm), to provide researchers with standardized reagents and vaccine testing services. This contract has proven to be an essential component of support for national and international TB researchers and the NIAID is now re-competing this contract to maintain such a valuable resource. 

Since the resurgence of TB in the US during the early 1990s, NIAID has steadily increased funding through its TB programs to support research needs and provide state of the art resources to the community to keep pace with the rapid advances in the field. During the past 10 years, major milestones have been achieved in TB research, marked by the completion of the genome of M. tuberculosis (Mtb), the creation of genetic tools to manipulate the pathogen, insights into the immunology of host responses to infection as well as the physiology of the microbe. These advances have led to a transition from basic research to include applied studies for the development of novel vaccines, the identification of promising drug candidates and the evaluation of novel diagnostic methods. This contract enables and facilitates the participation of researchers, many of whom are without the required BSL3 facilities needed to culture quantities of Mtb or evaluate candidate vaccines and drugs, in basic and clinical research projects that require these resources. 

This contract will provide standardized research materials, such as inactivated microorganisms, purified protein, lipid and carbohydrate antigens, culture filtrates, nucleic acid constructs and post-genomic reagents. Furthermore, this contract will fund development of advanced techniques and customized tools for the preparation of mycobacterial reagents and genomic analysis of gene expression in mycobacteria and animal models of TB disease. Data generated by these tools will assist the research community by creating standards for laboratory evaluations of commonly studied mycobacterial strains, and vaccine candidates and adjuvants. Furthermore, the contractor will provide expert guidance in the design, execution, and analysis of targeted experiments for the evaluation of vaccine candidates, adjuvants and immune-modulators.

It is anticipated that this contract will have a seven year performance period beginning approximately September 30, 2004.  RFP-NIH-NIAID-DMID-04-21 will be available electronically on or about October 06, 2003, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Drasko Petrovic, Director General, Telekom Srbija, ul. Takovska 2, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia & Montenegro, Phone: +381-11-303-20-30, Fax: +381-11-334-16-35.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for on achieving conformity with the telecommunications law project in Serbia & Montenegro.

As the monopoly provider of fixed-line services, Telekom Srbija provides local, national long-distance and international voice services; Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN); leased lines; data transmission services; fixed satellite services; and various value-added and telematic services.  Its mobile division, Telekom Srbija Mobile, covers more than 65% of the national territory and has some 1.5 million subscribers, or around 50% of the mobile market.  Telekom Srbija is also the main provider of Internet access and of bandwidth to Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and has plans to become an ISP in its own right. 

Despite the fact that Telekom Srbija has achieved a basic teledensity of 27%, which is on a par with its neighbors, and is beginning to deploy some advanced infrastructure and services, a number of challenges remain.  The overall digitalization of the network is lacking, there is a waiting list of over 300,000 for basic telephone line installation, and call completion rates are below regional and European standards.

A Telecommunications Law, based on existing legislation, domestic and international practice and standards, and on the relevant European Union (EU) Directives, has been adopted by the Serbian Parliament.  The Law allocates the various competencies and responsibilities in the sector among the Government of Serbia, the Ministry of Transport & Telecommunications and the newly established Telecommunications Agency of Serbia, which is the telecommunications regulator.  The new law leaves unchanged the current timetable for the elimination of Telekom Srbija’s monopoly.

This technical assistance would allow Telekom Srbija to come into compliance with the new Telecommunications Law.  The new law imposes requirements on Telekom Srbija, as monopoly provider, to create the conditions for the liberalization of telecommunications services already scheduled for June 2005.  Telekom Srbija will be required to move to cost-based tariffs, provide cost-based interconnection fees, separate accounting, and calculate the cost of providing universal service.  The technical assistance will further the liberalization of telecommunications in Serbia by bringing Telekom Srbija into conformity with this law.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $293,814 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

<DESC>Headquarters Standard System Group, Combat Ammunition System (CAS) Program Management Office is conducting market research to find if a commercial means of accounting for munitions can be attained.  CAS is a web-based system, accessed through the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) that provides inventory accounting for all munitions stored and used by the United States Air Force at locations around the world.  CAS will incorporate both wholesale and retail functions.  The current CAS capability utilizes processes and procedures from the 1960s and hasn’t been updated to incorporate wireless technologies readily available in 2003.  It is web based, but only for the ability to store balances from all 45 prime sites at a central location.  Cost accounting methodology utilizes latest contract cost for all assets regardless of actual cost of individual items.  Wholesale functions have not yet been incorporated.   CAS is assumed to fall within three categories: (1) Stand-alone munitions such as bullets, grenades, etc; (2) Munitions that must be built up, such as a bomb and tail fins. Many different configurations can be built by mixing and matching components.  All components must be individually tracked even after build-up.  The end item must also be tracked by a common designation, and war planners must be able to do “what-if” exercises based on quantities of components. (3) Missiles; configuration data must be tracked—many missiles have internal components with individual shelf life and serialized control. Maintenance actions and movements must be tracked for the life of the missile.   CAS will be the sole accounting and tracking system for munitions.  From the time an item is planned for procurement at the depot until it is expended and reordered, CAS must account and reflect the current status.  Paperwork elimination is a primary goal and usage of the Air Force Identification Card, the PKI enabled Common Access Card (CAC), is essential.  Automated in-transit tracking is desired, using technology similar to “On-Star”, for example.  Serialized control is required for all items with unit cost exceeding $500 for accounting and maintenance (TCTO) actions.  Storage and shipment require edits to assure maximum net explosive weights and explosive material compatibilities are not violated.  Expenditure updates upon release from bomb bays/wings (when in the clear) is desirable; however the ability to scan aircraft and update launch-load records upon return is acceptable.   Continued incorporation of CAS into GCSS is required.  CAS must be able to be used anyplace in the world utilizing ruggedized equipment with either commercial or military web access.  Autonomous operations must be able to take place in the event connectivity is broken with automatic update upon reconnect. The updated CAS must be simple, take advantage of common operator knowledge and have a simplified user interface including set-up and operation.    Interested vendors should submit their capabilities information via email to gail.sosa@gunter.af.mil or mail to: HQ SSG/PK, 490 East Moore Drive, Suite 270 (Bldg. 892), Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex AL 36114-3004.   The capabilities information should show what can be done to achieve CAS roadmap and should address any significant foreseen risks.  There are no pre-conceived restrictions on design.  The information should include a graphical prototype and a description of the concept in 10 pages or less. Please specify whether the firm is a large business, small business, very small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  Also, specify if the firm is U.S. or foreign-owned.  All responses should be received on or before COB 5 November 2003.  This is a request for information only.  No solicitation will be generated or contract awarded as a result of this request.   Additionally, the Air Force will not pay for any information, documentation, and/or data submitted in response to this request for information.  For specific questions, please contact Ms. Gail Sosa at 334-416-6599 or gail.sosa@gunter.af.mil.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate 'AATD', U.S. Army Research Development and Engineering Center intends to procure Survivability Planner Associate Rerouter (SPAR) software to support AATDs mission of supporting developmental and fielded aviation systems. The goal of this program is to develop near real-time software tailored to small unit manned-unmanned team operations that allows team cooperative/collaborative responses to tactical threats and enhances team survivability.  Threat susceptibility algorithms will use onboard and off-board sensors, information feeds, and pre-mission data to assess the location of threats and to determine their ability to detect and engage own forces.  Cognitive decision aiding algorithms will be employed to produce o ptimized cooperative/collaborative behaviors for each team element.  The objectives of the SPAR software are rapid less than 1 sec and accurate greater than 90% situational understanding of threat lethality to own force assets and development of rapid rero ute options for evading or engaging these threats.  This system will be demonstrated through future Army mission flight simulations. Specific tasks associated with this work include, concept definition/preliminary and detailed design, threat lethality pred ictor algorithm development and demonstration, team 'actions on contact' cognitive decision aiding algorithm development and demonstration, and software integration with existing manned/unmanned mission management software and flight simulation demonstrati on.  A single cost-plus fixed-fee contract is anticipated. The planned period of performance for this effort is 42 months with an anticipated award date of  5 March 2004.

MEYER Contracting Officer Attachments: 1.Key Performance Parameters 2.System Capabilities and Characteristics Parameters 3.Additional Technical Information Requested NOTE:  The Industry Day attendance roster, minutes, and questions from 9-29-03  will be posted the week of 6-10 October.   ///UPDATE END/// UPDATE (9-23-03)  Paragraph 1 below of the ESUP T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP) RFI  issued on 8-28-03 stated that the government would be conducting an Industry  Day 29 Sep 2003 and that the specific time and location were yet to be  determined.  Both the time and the location have been determined as follows: We will be holding this conference on Monday, September 29th, 2003 from 1:00pm  to 5:00pm (Eastern Standard Time).  We will be meeting at the Ervin J. Nutter  Center in the "Berry Room" conference facility.  It is located within the  Nutter Center at 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway in Dayton, Ohio, 45435-0001, USA.   This link, http://www.nuttercenter.com/berry/index.html, should provide more  information about the conference center.  A tentative agenda and information on  local accomodations is attached.   /////UPDATE END///// The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center is analyzing and assessing industry capabilities to provide an  upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s ejection  seats, escape path clearance, inter-seat sequencing, as well as the physical  accommodation of a greater range of aircrew personnel.  The Government  anticipates conducting the first Industry Day on 29 Sep 2003 (specific time and  location to be determined).  This will be Industry’s initial opportunity to  meet with cognizant Government representatives and to discuss the known  requirements and intent of the T-38 ESUP.  We are actively seeking Industry’s  inputs in helping us develop the acquisition strategy for this program.  Due to  size limitations, no more than three (3) representatives per company may attend  this meeting. A simulated T-38C cockpit, to be located at AFRL, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH,  will be available to Industry for inspections, measurements, etc. to aid in  Industry’s partnership with the Government in developing the acquisition  strategy.  The modified cockpit mock-up will be available to Industry  approximately late October/November 2003.  Companies interested in obtaining  access to the mock-up must request this in writing through the individuals  listed at the end of this synopsis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program and the  results of a recent Air Force Research Laboratory anthropometrical study on the  T-38C aircraft will be given. This will be followed by an “open forum” of  question and answers.  Following the open forum, Industry representatives may  individually engage with Government representatives for appointments (one hour  or less) to present their capabilities and concepts.  Maximum leverage  of “available technology” in any technical approach is highly encouraged.  This  is the initial step to establish industry’s understanding of the T-38 ESUP and  to allow the Government to determine market capabilities. Attendees must  indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 10 Sep 03 via the  individuals listed at the end of this synopsis.  Similarly, if you are  interested in having access to the T-38 cockpit mock-up please provide your  request, in writing, to the listed individuals contained at the conclusion of  this synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this RFI and notification.  Submitting capabilities  and concepts in response to this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be  compensated.

<DESC>Provide professional engineering service to evaluate all piping systems, including but not               limited to, domestic hot and cold water piping, heating hot water and chilled water piping, waste water piping, and steam system piping. The evaluation will result in a complete and comprehensive set of existing plumbing as-built drawings on AutoCAD 2000, a detailed master plan on the deficiencies found, with locations on drawings, recommendations on how to              correct the deficiencies, and finally a complete design project including drawings and specifications detailing all corrective actions required to bring all piping systems, within the              Atlanta VA Medical Center, in full compliance with all local, state, and federal plumbing codes. An extensive field investigation of the existing systems will be required, which may involve after hours work so as not to disturb the medical center operation.   This service is required due to numerous changes made to the existing piping systems over the past 35 years; some minor and some major have not been studied with respect to their overall impact on the systems as a whole, but rather as localized occurrences. This evaluation and design project will need to outline the corrective measures that must be taken to bring the systems in compliance, make them more energy efficient, and prevent major disruptions in service due to sudden system failures. The inclusion of isolation valves in the design will allow for periodic maintenance shutdowns that will have limited impact on hospital activities.  This is an unrestrictive procurement pursuant FAR Part 19.1007. Award is subject to availability of FY 2002 funds. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE OR PLANHOLDERSS LIST IS AVAILABLE. Firms desiring consideration shall submit SF 254's and SF 255's (See Note #24) by close of business (3:00PM EST) 11/7/03.

<DESC>Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository

The National Institute of Mental Health is conducting a market survey to assess the availability and technical capability of all types of organizations, to provide the scientific and technical expertise necessary to establish the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository, described below. This announcement is intended to conduct market research to establish: 1) whether small businesses are capable of performing this effort (as defined by NAICS Code 541710 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences); and 2) whether there is sufficient capability and interest from all types of organizations and businesses to conduct an efficient competition. 

Capability statements should include a concise summary of specific capabilities to perform this work by addressing the following: (1) professional qualifications and experience of specific personnel in providing these services; (2) the organization's specific experience related to this work; (3) the type of organization (e.g. small business [state NAICS Codes], nonprofit etc.). This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). Please provide three (3) copies of your capability statement by October 24, 2003. These statements should not be unnecessarily lengthy or elaborate.  Point of Contact: Bruce E. Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 443-2234, Fax (301) 443-0501, Email: ba9i@nih.gov

The Small Molecule Repository is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap Molecular Libraries initiative for the creation of an NIH small molecule library and screening centers (for additional information on the NIH Roadmap, see http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/).  It is anticipated that the Small Molecule Repository will be accomplished through a contract mechanism (a 5-10 year contract). The Small Molecule Repository will offer public sector biomedical researchers access to small organic molecules that can be used as chemical probes to study cellular pathways in greater depth and will provide new ways to explore the functions of major components of the cell in health and disease.  In order to provide these benefits, the library of small molecules must contain a sufficient number of diverse compounds to be screened for a large number of possible new activities and applications. To build such a library, a contract will be established to acquire, maintain, and distribute a collection of approximately 500,000 chemically diverse small molecules of both known and unknown activities. An NIH Molecular Libraries Steering Committee will help identify candidate compounds to be acquired from government, academic, industry and commercial sources. Over time, this collection will be expanded and modified to include compounds that are capable of interacting with an increasing number and diversity of biomolecular target domains. The development of such libraries will provide probes for studying molecular events, pathways, and networks in biologic systems that span the scale from single cells to whole organisms.

Anticipated requirements for the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository include the following tasks:

1) Compound Identification and Library Development.  The contractor, in coordination with a NIH Molecular Libraries Steering Committee, shall identify candidate compounds from government, academic, industry and commercial sources, and acquire a collection of approximately 500,000 compounds meeting criteria to be specified by the Government Project Officer (GPO)/Steering Committee (i.e., stability, solubility, availability of sufficient quantities, ease of re-supply or re-synthesis, diversity). Initially the contract will focus primarily on this task. Over the course of the contract, this function will continue but the effort will decrease as the library develops in size.  
 
2) Handling, Plating and Distribution.  All compounds shall be bar-coded and arrayed in sets suitable for supplying to high-throughput screening (HTS) facilities.  The contractor shall have the capability to array compounds into both 96 and 384 well plates to produce arrays in a format suitable for long term storage and shall have the ability to produce arrays for distribution (i.e. daughter-plates developed from plate replication or reformatting into higher density 1536 or 3456 well plates).  Compound arrays shall be distributed to the Molecular Library Screening Centers and other interested HTS facilities.  The contractor shall also provide arrays of compounds to investigators on a fee for service basis.

3) Storage.  Compounds shall be stored in arrayed sets under conditions that ensure optimal stability and purity.  The contractor shall provide the necessary expertise, equipment, and facilities to store, maintain, and track the compound collection inventory.  The contractor shall propose a plan to monitor the stability of compounds in the library (e.g., analysis by LC/MS, HPLC, and/or NMR).

4) Re-supply and Re-synthesis.  The contractor shall monitor the compound inventory to ensure that sufficient quantities of all compounds (minimum of 1mg) are available to support screening needs.  As compounds become depleted the Contractor shall purchase sufficient quantities of the compound to replenish the inventory.  The Contractor shall have the ability to synthesize, at a minimum purity of 90%, sufficient quantities of depleted compounds that cannot be re-purchased.

5) Informatics.  The Contractor shall provide the necessary informatics support to track compound inventory and distribution, including maintenance of a compound collection inventory database and shipping and distribution databases for each screening center and for extramural requests.  The contractor shall create and maintain a repository website, describing the program and providing a list of available arrays.  The contractor shall also provide the capability of interfacing any repository informatics systems with other Molecular Libraries databases.  

6) Confidentiality. The contractor may be acquiring and handling some proprietary compounds under this contract.  To protect the preexisting rights of these compound suppliers the NIMH may exercise its authority under FAR 27.303 in seeking a deviation for this contract from the standard patent rights clause, FAR 52.227-11, Patent Rights - Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) (June 1997); if approved, this deviated clause would restrict the Contractor's rights in subject inventions involving proprietary compounds. The NIMH will publicize this clause in full text, and seek public comments, at a later date.

<RESPDATE>110303
<CONTACT>Contracting Officer, G. Michael Dodd (Mick), 202-781-2848
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command seeks to identify potential sources of nondevelopmental item (NDI)  systems designed for surface combatant ships, which are capable of detecting and tracking submarine periscopes by using or modifying existing US Navy RADAR systems.  “Nondevelopmental item” means – 1) Any previously developed item of supply used exclusively for government purposes . . .; 2) Any item described in paragraph 1) of this definition that requires only minor modification . . .; or 3) Any item of supply being produced that does not meet the requirements of paragraph 1) or 2) solely because the item is not yet in use.  The following Key Performance Parameters (KPP) are the Navy’s threshold minimum and/or objective values:  System must be able to detect periscope targets with a radar cross-section corresponding to that of a submarine periscope from 0.5nm out to the horizon in sea state 3 and lower.  The Government prefers detection in sea state 4 and lower.  The probability of detection should equal or exceed 0.5, with a relatively low false alarm rate.   The purpose of this sources sought announcement is to test the market place for NDI radar systems, which meet the above KPPs.  The Government intends to evaluate whether target detection capability can be incorporated into an existing USN radar or distribution system through field change modifications.  Under no circumstance, does the Government intend to add a new and separate RADAR system to that which currently exists aboard USN surface combatants.  The allotted time to evaluate NDI systems, design and incorporate engineering changes or modification kits into existing systems is very limited, as is the projected budget.  Interested parties must submit a written expression of interest, accompani ed by copies of proven periscope detection test reports and NDI radar system photographs to the attention of G. Michael Dodd (Mick), SEA 02431 at the following address: Naval Sea Systems Command, Isaac Hull Ave SE, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-2030; telephone 202-781-2848; fax 202-781-4637 or 4649; e-mail, doddgm@navsea.navy.mil.  Submissions of interest must be received by 3 November 2003 and must specify the size of the Contractor’s business concern.  No award will be made as a result of this sources sought synopsis.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only.

<DESC>The 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg AFB, CA, is soliciting offers to provide High Intensity Lighting for Atlas IIAS MLV-14 to SLC-3E. The contractor will provide all services, non-personal: Contractor to furnish all labor, tools, parts, materials, facilities (no government-furnished property), transportation, supervision necessary to provide high intensity Lighting for Atlas IIAS MLV-14. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation reference number is FA4610-04-T-0001. This solicitation incorporates Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-09. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 335129 and the size standard is 500 employees. This solicitation is set aside for small businesses. The Department of Labor Wage Determination 94-2063, Revision # 20, CA Santa Barbara applies to this solicitation. Lighting is required to illuminate the entire outside surface of Launch Vehicle 360 degrees to 400-foot candles minimum, for a minimum period of three consecutive hours. Contractor will start setting up equipment approximately 10 days prior to launch. Contractor will need to have completed setup and testing of lights no later than 3 days prior to launch. All setup and testing needs to be coordinated through the Squadron Coordination Center (SCC) and to be conducted on a noninterference basis to launch pad activities. The test will be used to verify remote operability and to focus lights. The estimated launch date is 20 Nov 03 between 0400 and 0800. The official launch time will be given at initial setup. The contractor will be responsible for the loading and unloading of all equipment. The three locations stated for the lights do not require a lot of access during the Atlas IIAS cycle. If the lights interfere with the Government’s requirement to access the sight, they will need to be temporarily removed. Two of the locations will require a vehicle with off-road capability of four-wheel drive. The lights may be able to stay in placed for up to 14 days at the contractor’s discretion, but they may need to be covered to protect them from the environment. The time available for the contractor to move the equipment may vary depending on the activities at the pad. The Government will provide at least two days to move the equipment in or out, but the days may not be consecutive. If the launch is delayed after final testing is complete, and the lights and/or antennas are removed from the lighting locations, they will need to be retested. The test is to ensure that the lights are focused to the proper locations on the vehicle and to confirm that the remote operations for turning the lights on and off is still operable. The contractor will have three locations to position their lights/equipment, as indicated below. SLC-3 East: Atlas IIAS, 165 feet tall and 15 feet in diameter: 1st location is approximately 800 feet from launch vehicle, 2nd location is approximately 700 feet from launch vehicle and 3rd location is approximately 3000 feet from launch vehicle. The Government will determine final lighting position. Generators that operate the equipment will need to operate continuously for a minimum of 3 hours; there is no commercial power available and contractors are required to supply all fuel. Contractor will need to provide statewide portable equipment registration certificates to the Government for all generators brought to Vandenberg AFB. Generator run times and fuel usage need to be reported to the Government after every use. The launch may or may not go as scheduled.  The contractor shall be available to operate equipment until a successful launch; this could be from 24 hours to several weeks. If the launch is delayed, the contractor can store the equipment on-site; however they may need to remove the equipment to a lay down area outside of the fence. The requirement to remove the equipment would be driven by the vendor’s need to protect the equipment from the environment, and the required access to the light locations for maintenance. The Government is not responsible for rodent or weather damage. There will only be one launch window per each 24 hours.  If the launch is delayed, personnel will not be required to remain on-site.  The contractor may, at his discretion, remove equipment from the launch site.  If the launch is delayed after the testing period, and the lights and/or equipment is removed from the lighting locations, they will need to be retested.  This test will be to ensure that the lights are focused to the proper locations on the vehicle, and to confirm that the remote operation for turning the lights on and off is still operable. Using a remote transmitter, lights need to be turned on and off remotely from 4 miles away at a fallback area, a repeater may also be needed due to terrain.  The frequency used for the remote transmitter equipment will need to be approved by the Government prior to use.  A frequency of 2.4 GHz has worked in the past.  Offerors shall submit the following information with their proposal: 1. The quantity and model number of lights that are going to be used at each location. 2. The data/specification sheets that show the Beam Spread, Beam Lumens and Avg. Candle Power setting. 3. The number, size, location, make and model number of the Generators that will be used. 4. The quantity, location, manufacturer and model numbers of the antennas, transmitters and receivers. 5. The labor required for set-up, teardown, test operation and day of launch operation. 6. A rough schedule showing set-up, test run, day of launch and teardown plans for the lights. The contractor shall be available to perform the services 5 hours before specified launch window and remain for duration of launch window or until launch occurs, whichever happens first.  Launch windows may vary from several minutes to several hours. The contractor needs to be on the Entry Authorization Listing to access South Vandenberg AFB, and must be escorted while on the space launch complex.  The contractor will need to provide their own escorts.  Contractor personnel should also ensure that they have in their possession photo identification.  Vehicle operators also require operators license, registration, and proof of insurance. The estimated launch date is 20 Nov 03. If the contractor is notified of a delay prior to the required five-day set-up & testing period, no additional cost will be incurred. There will be one (1) basic line item with two optional line items for delays that may occur while the contractor is on site. Line items will be listed as follows: 0001 - To provide high intensity lighting for Atlas IIAS (SLC which will include all cost for set-up, testing, and lighting for the launch as outlined above. 0002 - (Optional line item) Delays one day to one week when the contractor is notified of delay while on site.
