<DESC>American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Project Firm, Fixed-Price (FFP) Design/Build contract - GSA has need for full design and installation of an engineered copper scrim product with all its necessary components, support, anchors, labor and materials for the new 8 story, 239,600 gross square foot United States Federal Courthouse in El Paso, Texas. The project envisions a fully installed and functioning system that is designed to accommodate the existing building's structural and architectural components. The original concept design featured this energy conservation, copper exterior window shading scrim, to act as a shading device against the El Paso sun. The solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps on or about January 26, 2010. The contract will be issued as a Design-Build with one base and three options in which the base will be awarded for the west side of the building and the three options being for the south, east and north sides. The selected contractor will accomplish all work in accordance with the Scope of Work (SOW) and conceptual design drawings provided by GSA. The designer may come up with something different than the concept design as long as it is similar. Installation cannot begin until the construction contractor for the courthouse has vacated the site. This procurement will be competed full and open. Proposals will be evaluated for technical capability and price. Technical qualifications are significantly more important than price. The Government will provide bridging documents, for background information purposes only, on the original concept project design documents (plans and specifications) to prospective offerors as part of the Request for Proposal (RFP). An on site pre-proposal conference will be held to allow all prospective offerors an opportunity to visit the project site and ask questions about the project SOW. Prior to receipt of proposals all offerors must be registered in CCR (Central Contractor Registration) at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx and have completed their Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/.

This project will provide all site improvements, utilities, pavements, security fencing with gates, emergency generator, access road, area lighting, fire protection and communications support.  An access road is required to the POL compound, and fencing with two motorized gates and one pedestrian gate.  The project scope also includes the demolition of the existing five underground fuel storage tanks, one off-loading station, 2 fill stands. The work will include two alternates. Alternate A will include installation of internally lined, externally coated carbon steel piping throughout fueling system. Alternate B will include installation of stainless steel pipe upstream of issue filter separators FSI-1 and FSI-2 in lieu of the internally lined, externally coated carbon steel piping. Each alternate (Alternate A and Alternate B) will also include two options to install an automatic tank gauging system and a closed circuit television system. The preferred choice of the government is Alternate B, stainless steel piping. NOTE: The Government intends to award a single contract from this solicitation for either Alternate A or Alternate B.  The alternate selection is contingent on availability of funds.  Magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. The estimated performance period is 540 calendar days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed plus 90 calendar days for final establishment of grass after seeding. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. Proposals will be evaluated on technical, past performance and price. THIS IS AN SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE ACQUISITION.
