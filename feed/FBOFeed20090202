<p>AFRL Rome has a requirement to perform software research and development for the RIE Division, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, Rome NY (AFRL Rome). AFRL Rome has a requirement to develop and integrate new technology into real-time spiral releases of the Web-Enabled Temporal Analysis System Tool Kit (WebTAS TK) software, and sustain the operational baseline to meet the functional requirements of users through software enhancement and on-site engineering support. WebTAS TK supports Air Force efforts in providing Department of Defense commands, services and various Federal Agencies with a software toolkit that provides a general data visualization and analysis infrastructure for the analysis of temporal, spatial, entity and association information. The flexible WebTAS TK architecture provides access to multiple data sources, data mining, and collaboration tools that facilitate trend, link, pattern, and distributed analysis to support activity prediction and customer unique capabilities like Strategic Worldwide Integration Capability (SWIC), Predictive Analysis and Network-centric Analysis for Collaborative Intelligence Assessment (PANACIA) and Master Air Attach Plan (MAAP) Toolkit. This effort will perform engineering and technical tasks and operations and maintenance support for current and new users of the WebTAS TK software toolset. Technical enhancements are needed to correct any identified shortcomings in the toolset and to provide additional capabilities, features, processes, and documentation. The enhancements will extend WebTAS TK functions and provide more effective and efficient capabilities to meet the needs of the users. Installation support will be needed to install the WebTAS TK software and hardware, and train users at multiple sites throughout the world. Operations and maintenance actions will be needed to provide continued system support to current customer sites and to the new sites after system installation. In the course of performance, the contractor will interface with various DoD and Government agencies through visits and electronic means, and technical visits that will take place at various sites, worldwide. The contractor will also provide technical support to the Air Force Research Lab/Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division to assist in the analysis, design, development, integration, testing, and evaluation. Anticipated deliverables include software, hardware, and technical documentation. An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months. The maximum contemplated ordering amount is anticipated to be approximately $300,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The prime contractor and their subcontractors for this contract must have Top Secret SCI security clearances; foreign allied participation at the prime contractor level shall not be permitted for this effort. In reference to the WebTAS TK effort, information can be obtained by contacting the Government WebTAS TK Program Manager, Michael Welch, at (315) 330-7758, who will forward a copy of the WebTAS TK Read Library which has been updated as of the time of this notice.

In addition to providing Launch and Test Range System (LTRS) sustainment, logistics, depot level maintenance, and options for LTRS product modifications, including modifications engineering, integration, and test, for both the Eastern Range (ER) and Western Range (WR), the Government intends to consolidate the above SLRS follow-on LTRS effort with the effort of the two existing ER &amp; WR support contracts for operations, scheduling, base support services, maintenance, downrange base operating support services, and other support (Eastern Range Technical Services (ERTS) &amp; Western Range Operation Communications and Information Contracts (WROCI)), thereby combining the above scope into a single "Launch and Test Range System (LTRS) Integrated Support Contract (LISC)" to meet the HQ AFSPC vision of improving LTRS efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed LISC effort is scheduled to commence in August 2010 and is envisioned to have a total budget of approximately $2-3 billion+ over 10 years. LRSW requests interested, qualified sources to respond to this RFI with a White Paper as detailed below.</p>
<p>2. The LTRS consists of the ER, headquartered at Patrick AFB in Florida, and the WR, headquartered at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The LTRS is comprised of a network of equipment within 12 different subsystems which must function in concert to fulfill mission requirements. These 12 subsystems are: Command Destruct, Communications, Data Handling, Safety, Optics, Planning &amp; Scheduling, Radar, Surveillance, Timing &amp; Sequencing, Telemetry, Weather, and Modeling and Simulation.</p>
<p>3. Please be advised this is a request for information only, and does not obligate the Government to reimburse any cost associated with preparation and/or submission of this information. Nor does the RFI guarantee the Government will issue your company a Request for Proposal (RFP) or award a contract for supplies or services. Instructions for submittals are provided below. The Government may use information submitted by respondents to this RFI to help assess the feasibility of a LISC acquisition and to assist in developing effective industry incentives for a LISC acquisition strategy. A subsequent LISC RFI #2 is envisioned to further understand industry capabilities and enhance the contemplated LISC acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>4. The contemplated LISC would provide the Government with a single prime contractor responsible and accountable for complete and integrated LTRS operations, scheduling, organizational level maintenance, depot level maintenance (consistent with USAF &amp; AFSPC 2-level maintenance policies), sustainment, logistics, base support services, downrange base operating support services, and optional LTRS modifications at both ER &amp; WR. It is envisioned that the LISC would improve efficiencies and reduce Operating and Maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, leveraging the advantages of a single responsible contractor approach to LTRS (ER &amp; WR) support and management, e.g., seamless, problem-free transitions of products (including training, certifications, and associated technical data) from modifications phase to operational acceptance. Public safety, mission success, assured access to space as well as improving operational and test support is of prime interest to the Government. Following OSD &amp; AFSPC guidance, the LISC shall implement Performance Based Logistics for Space (PBL-S) and contract incentives that: 1) ensure rigorous and objective LTRS reliability, maintainability, and availability (RMA) data preparation, measurements, and collection, and 2) ensure ER &amp; WR are "green" (operational) throughout each "launch and test campaign" at the lowest price to Government. Moreover, the LISC requires a contract incentive structure that is immediately responsive to LTRS dynamics, such as LTRS assets decommissions, relocations, and additions.</p>
<p>II. White Paper Content: Interested industry respondents are requested to provide a White Paper that includes answers/information with regards to the following questions/requests:</p>
<p>1. Maintaining a 24/7 operational LTRS<br />a. Present an approach to maximize range flexibility in both launch and test campaigns at minimum manning.<br />b. Present a proposed skill set required to achieve optimum LTRS flexibility.<br />c. Present an approach that facilitates common data management tools across the LTRS that results in standard data products and reports for both ER and WR.<br />d. Present an approach to deconflicting multiple range missions that may occur simultaneously. <br />e. Present an approach to implementing Performance-Based Logistics for Space (PBL-S) into LTRS.<br />f. Present a singular management and communication approach that encompasses all LTRS operating/support locations and organizations.</p>
<p>2. LTRS transformation <br />a. Present an approach to effectively decommission LTRS assets while ensuring a 24/7 operational LTRS.<br />b. Provide examples of how your company has managed large-scale transformation on other programs, to include the decommission of assets while maintaining operational capability.</p>
<p>3. LISC implementation<br />a. Present an approach to incentivize successful implementation of PBL-S, objective RMA data collection, and launch and test campaign successes (including simultaneous campaigns at each Range), at lowest price to the Government.<br />b. Present a LISC contract incentive structure that is immediately responsive to LTRS dynamics, such as LTRS assets decommissions, relocations, and additions, over the life of LISC.<br />c. Present suggestions for contract type and CLIN structure.<br />d. Present an approach to potential price incentives. Provide examples where appropriate.<br />e. Identify opportunities for small business participation with your approach. Provide the methodology used to make this determination</p>
<p>4. Identify the top 3 challenges associated with the LISC contract consolidation and present an effective risk mitigation strategy. Provide examples where appropriate.</p>
<p>5. Identify any perceived or actual Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) associated with this effort with respect to other current and future LTRS contracts (see also "LTRS SE&amp;I" Solicitation FA8811-09-R-0001).</p>
<p>III. Industry Days: An industry day session may be scheduled, based on the results of the RFI. RFI respondents may be invited to participate in supplemental industry day one-on-one discussions with the Government to discuss their White Paper information in greater detail. However, failure to respond to the RFI does not preclude proposal submittal nor industry day participation if a formal acquisition is announced.</p>
<p>IV. Small Business Consideration: The Small Business size standard is: 1,000 employees. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, HUBZone, historically black colleges, and minority institutions. The Small Business point of contact is Mr. Willard Strozier at 310-653-1108.</p>
<p>V. White Paper Classification: Respondents shall provide an unclassified, non-proprietary response to this RFI.</p>
<p>VI. White Paper Format: Responses shall not exceed fifty (50) pages; the Government will not consider pages in excess of 50 pages. Page size shall be 8.5 x 11; font size shall be 12 pt. The White Paper cover page and table of contents pages will not count against the page limit. The Government may not accept company literature or marketing materials.</p>
<p>VII. Response Due Date: 12:00pm PST, 17 February, 2009.</p>
<p>VIII. Submission Instructions: Submit an electronic copy in either PDF format or Microsoft Word format to the Government Contracting Officer, Ms. Senah Williams, at senah.williams@losangeles.af.mil by the Response Due Date.<br /><br />IX.

<DESC>NASA intends to extend Contract NNA04BC25C with Eloret Corporation on a sole-sourcebasis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of AmesResearch Center's (ARC) Code TS, Space Technology Division. The objective is to extendthe performance period for five months. The current Contractor provides the following mission critical support services underSpace Technology Research and Development (STRAD). The principal purpose of this contractis to support the Space Technology Division at NASA Ames Research Center to obtain theservices needed for the development of technologies for use in the design and fabricationof prototype vehicles that travel at hypervelocities in the atmosphere of Earth and otherbodies in the solar system. The Contractor provides support in the areas of Reacting FlowEnvironments, Nanotechnology, Thermo-Physics Facilities, and Thermal Protection Materialsand Systems. This extension will allow for a continuation of services to ensure programcontinuity and critical mission support and avoid significant technical impacts while acompetitive follow-on acquisition is completed. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA04BC25C,value and extend the period of performance for a period of five months, from February 28,2009 through July 1, 2009. The current contractor, Eloret Corporation is considered theonly contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period of performance for theextension. Awarding a five-month contract to another source, at the same time evaluationsor  recompetition of the follow-on is in process, would not allow for sufficient phase-inperiod, thereby affecting the seamless continuity of services and cause unacceptabledelays in fulfilling ARCs requirements. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:00 PM. PST onFebruary 9, 2009. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which the Defense Distribution Center, New Cumberland, PA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for Optical Memory Laser Cards.  The cards are used as part of an Automated Manifest System.  These cards have the capability to hold 1200 pages of information, and can withstand the harshest military conditions without any loss of data.

General Dynamics Information Technology Inc. is the only source that can provide these cards due to the proprietary nature of the Automated Manifest System.  Any attempt to develop an alternate source to provide this system, if possible, would result in a substantial cost to the Government.  Accordingly, the Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order (FFP) utilizing FAR Part 13 to General Dynamics Information Technology Inc. for the Optical Memory Laser Cards.

Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The delivery date will be 30 days after receipt of the order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 326130 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. 

All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to provide the Optical Memory Laser Cards by 4:00 PM EST, 17 FEB 2009 to Daniel Herring, Acquisition Operations, DDC J-7, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Phone:  717-770-6030, FAX:  717-770-5689, or e-mail:  daniel.herring@dla.mil for consideration by the agency.  If no affirmative responses are received by 4:00 PM EST, 17 FEB 2009 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated and awarded to General Dynamics Information Technology.

As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's core Microsoft Exchange Messagining infrastructure.  The equipment listed above is required to support the EML Exchange 14 Rapid Deployment Project.  EML is working in close partnership with Microsoft Corporation as part of the Microsoft Rapid Deployment Program (RDP) to verify whether or not Exchange 14 overcomes the limitations of Exchange 2003 in current Department operations.  Hewlett Packard hardware, software, and services are integral to current core E-Mail Operations functions of worldwide message routing and Central Site mailbox storage.  Hewlett Packard systems are tightly integrated with Microsoft Exchange and integrate seamlessly into the Department's networking infrastructure.  Therefore, EML personnel have a thorough understading of operating and maintaining Microsoft Exchange on Hewlett Packard servers.  Acquisition of servers from any other supplier would involve substantial risk in the areas of quality and continuity of operations, cost for maintaining current operations, and schedule for deployment Exchange 14 upon successful completion of this Rapid Deployment Project is successful.  In order to properly test Exchange 14, EML needs to use HP servers.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Market Survey for Training and Meeting Facilitation Services
This is a market survey for the above identified requirements.  This market survey is being released in accordance with FAA A.M.S. policy 3.2.1.2.1.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only and will not be released.  Proprietary information will be protected if appropriately marked as such.  This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of a product or service, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This is not a screening information request (SIR) or a request for proposal (RFP). The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The purpose of this market survey is to seek industry input and comment on Training and Meeting Facilitation Services, and to allow an opportunity for industry suggestions and recommendations for alternate strategies.  
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.   Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training, with a small business size standard of 6.5M
The FAA has a requirement for training and meeting facilitation services for the Air Traffic Technical Training and Development Annual Conference that will take place in spring of 2009.  Approximately 125 participants will attend this 3-5 day conference including FAA Headquarters and field personnel responsible for air traffic controller and technical training initiatives and programs.
Scope of Work:
The contractor shall assist the FAA in designing conference content, structure, and learning activities centered around a collaborative planning process involving all facets of the FAA technical training community.  In addition, the Contractor shall provide meeting facilitation services for selected portions of the conference.  The Contractor may also assist in determining the make up of conference attendees. The Contractor shall submit a brief report (10 to 12 pages) describing the outcomes of the conference with an emphasis on any action plans developed by the FAA during the conference. While the location of the conference has yet to be determined, some possible venues include St. Louis, Dallas/Ft. Worth and Atlanta.
Prospective candidates should have the following experience and knowledge:
1.	Training and meeting facilitation expertise
2.	Experience developing, executing and facilitating effective meetings   utilizing the Future Search method
3.	Ability to integrate Future Search Conference with other large group   processes as appropriate to achieve learning outcomes
4.	Program/conference design
5.	Experience in creating a culture of collaboration
6.	Use of collaborative technologies
Purpose/outcomes of conference: employees in the technical training and development directorate will define the purpose of their organization and sub-organizations, with clear roles and responsibilities, and improve relationships with stakeholders, partners and the service units they support.  Participants will establish common goals and strategies to achieve them, develop actions plans to improve levels of service, and link individual work with organizational and agency strategic management plans and flight goals.
In addition to the formal conference structure, we want to include time for activities to build relationships and help staff get to know each other better.  We may include poster sessions or other means of sharing information about work accomplishments and best practices.
Responses to the Market Survey shall include a brief work sample that describes how the vendor approaches conference design and develops training content.  The work sample may be based on actual previous work or developed in response to this Market Survey and should be noted accordingly.  The combined response including the work sample shall not exceed 6 pages and include the Business Declaration Form (Attached) as an acceptable additional page.

Research laboratories are located on levels B3, B2, 1, 3 and 5.  The laboratories lead to the southeast and southwest patient care units through distally placed elevator lobbies.

The purpose is to provide consistent and reliable Patient Care Unit Clerk (PCUC) staffing for various patient care units and patient care support areas within the NIH Clinical Center.   Twenty-eight (28) positions have been designated to be filled by contract staff on an ongoing basis.   In addition, there will be a need for intermittent patient care unit clerk staffing services to cover planned/unplanned leave of contractor staff and government vacancies.  These services will be performed in various locations throughout the Clinical Center, including:  inpatient units, outpatient clinics, diagnostic testing areas, surgery, admissions, centralized scheduling and the patient travel voucher office.  

The Clinical Center has a need for dedicated and committed individuals to perform in a health care environment that is aligned to the NIH mission.  The Contractor(s) shall, on a consistent basis, provide contract personnel to provide Patient Care Unit Clerk staffing services. This may include a contractor staying beyond their assigned tour of duty to meet the program of care needs. This contract will be managed by the Ambulatory Care Services Department of Nursing and Patient Care Services at the NIH Clinical Center.  The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that staff assigned to this contract will provide consistent and reliable services meeting all the requirements of the specific position and meeting program needs. The contractor(s) shall be responsible for providing appropriate staff coverage in a timely manner when a contractor is on planned and unplanned leave to ensure continuity of services.  Personnel working in all the areas will be interacting in-person and by phone with patients, visitors, physicians, nurses and other staff and it is important that the contractor personnel provide outstanding, consistent customer service for all customers.   Patients that are seen at the NIH Clinical Center may be anxious, fearful, sick, have physical deformities, etc.   In addition, many of the patients and families are not from the local area and this sometimes creates additional anxiety.   It is extremely important that the contract personnel maintain a consistent high level of customer service and convey understanding, responsiveness, care and compassion. 

The duties listed below are a general list of the requirements for this contract.  The patient care unit clerk will only be performing the duties for the specific area assigned. Not all duties below apply to all areas.

The government will provide all training required to perform these duties.  All duties shall be performed accurately and timely and all interactions with customers (internal and external) to the Clinical Center must be performed in a professional manner demonstrating outstanding customer service. 

The functions performed by the Patient Care Unit Clerks are critical to supporting the clinical research mission of the NIH Clinical Center.  The personnel assigned to perform these functions will be interacting directly with patients, visitors and staff.   They may be the first and lasting impression that our patients and visitors have of the Clinical Center and it is important that our customers always leave a service area with a positive experience.

The Government intends to make either a single or multi award to the intended offeror(s).  The anticipated award for this acquisition shall be on or about March 31, 2009 with the Base 12-month award and (4) successive options.  The solicitation for Request for Proposal shall be released on or about February 17, 2009. Those interested offerors may request the solicitation through written request to Ms. Deborah Britton at dbritton@cc.nih.gov.

Justification</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tomotherapy Inc. is the sole
distributor of the HI-ART Helical Tomotherapy System.<span>&nbsp; </span>All system components are highly integrated
through both proprietary hardware as well as software.<span>&nbsp; </span>ROB purchased an early version of the HI-ART
system 2 years ago and, while it is an excellent system, it has suffered from
several deficiencies, all of which involve the original couch design.<span>&nbsp; </span>These are (1) unlike vertical and
longitudinal position, the lateral position is a manual adjustment and prone to
operator error, (2) the vertical motion is not a true vertical movement, but an
arc that changes the longitudinal position as the vertical is changes,
requiring an unnecessary repositioning, and (3) the original couch top is a
thin piece of carbon fiber and suffers from &ldquo;springboarding&rdquo;; hence <span>&nbsp;</span>the couch top sags as it is moved into the
gantry bore, changing the position of the patient relative to the setup
position.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tomotherapy Inc. has
recognized these problems and has developed a High Performance Couch that it
offers as an upgrade to the system.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since it was developed and is exclusively marketed by the manufacturer,
it will be fully integrated with the existing system and, as such, will not
void the existing and on-going maintenance contract that ROB has with the
vendor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This is not a solicitation
for competitive quotations.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, if
any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed they
may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished shall be in

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), intends to procure on a sole-source basis for a  Ra-224 Isotope Generator with additional processing to remove stable Pb with AlphaMed Inc., P.O. Box 607 Acton, MA 01720. 

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

Ra-224 generators are required for on-site production of the daughter radionuclide from the decay process, Pb-212, that the Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) has been using to perform extensive pre-clinical studies, a disseminated colorectal disease animal model system.  Ra-224 will be purchased in a generator form for use in ROBs dedicated Hot Cell laboratory.  The Ra-224  generator would be used for direct support of the toxicology and additional studies requisite for the IND for the clinical trial.  

The Ra-224 generator must be consistent with those previously prepared for and used by the Chemistry Section for their animal model pre-clinical therapy studies and originate from the same nuclear feedstock materials; therefore, insuring completely consistent chemical and radiochemical behavior and purity of the eluted Pb-212.  Activity levels of 15-20 mCi is a minimal amount of Ra-224 that has to be on the generators such that adequate amounts of Pb-212 can be provided.  

Alphamed has the exclusive contract from the Department of Energy (DOE) for marketing this radionuclide due to the parental being fissionable and not available from any commercial source in this country.  ROB uses the parental radionuclide, Pb-212, in its studies.  There are no other known sources which sell ready to use generators at greater than 2 mCi of Ra-224.

The process to remove stable Pb is critical to good operational generators for doing the animal model pre-clinical therapy studies.  The presence of stable Pb interferes and competes with the use of the radioactive Pb-212 that is generated from the Ra-224.  The Ra-224 generator and the translation process both reside with AlphaMed; therefore, AlphaMed is uniquely qualified to  provide the requirement with no disruption or delay to the on-going studies.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office on or before 11:00 AM EST on February 16, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  It is the vendors responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration/certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-90046-MM on all correspondence.

<SOLNBR>N6945009R0758

<ARCHDATE>03042009
<CONTACT>chris.mclaughlin@navy.mil chris.mclaughlin@navy.mil chris.mclaughlin@navy.mil
<DESC>REQUIREMENT:The requirement is to entirely replace building 8 which is in a failed and failing condition. This phase will house approximately 230 dynamic component repair personnel. There are a total of 1850 personnel who perform component rebuild and repair functions in Building 8. Follow on phases will house power plant remanufacturing, surface treatment and metalwork support processes, operational and accessory component repair functions, rotary aircraft rebuild, and other associated support functions.
CURRENT SITUATION:Currently repair personnel are housed in building 8 which is too old to adequately maintain and there is insufficient space to provide a good process flow as required for lean manufacturing, or accomodate newer technology equipment. The electrical system is underpowered, outdated and cannot be economically repaired any longer, the roofs are leaking, the drainage no longer works as designed and the roof structure requires steel pole reinforcements. Additionally, ability to use floor space is becoming a problem due to the steel roof support poles spread throughout the reinforced areas.
The contractor will be required to design and construct an industrial facility to house a portion of the dynamic component repair and rebuild functions at Corpus Christi Army Depot as Phase I of the Power Train and Integrated Manufacturing Processes Facility, replacing parts of Building 8, the main facility at Corpus Christi Army Depot.  Individual production shops to be relocated include: Rotor Control/ Landing gear, Rotor Head/ Cargo Assembly, Gear Box Assembly, Transmission Assembly, and Transmission/ Gear Box Test Cells.  Processes associated with these shops include disassembly, condition analysis, and repair, with some metal finishing and soldering.  Heating and air conditioning will be provided by self contained units.  Sustainability will be integrated into the design, development, and construction of the project in order to certify to a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver level.  Sustainable Design and Development (SDD) and Energy Policy Act ! of 2005 (EPAct05) features will be provided.  The overall facility will be required to meet Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) requirements in accordance with Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-01.  This project is estimated to complete in 550 calendar days from the date of award.  Estimated cost will exceed $10 Million.
The solicitation will result in the award of a firm fixed-price contract.  The proposed Request for Proposal (RFP) will be solicited under full and open competition.
Phase-one of the procurement process is a narrowing step of offerors up to a maximum of five (5) offerors (design-build teams) who offer the best technical value to the Government, unless the SSA determines that a number more than five (5) is in the Government's interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design-build contracting.  During phase-one, only phase-one evaluation factors apply.  Offerors shall not submit phase-two submittals until invited to participate in phase-two.
In phase-two, the successful phase-one offerors will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.  Phase-two firms will be invited to attend the Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit for the project.  Firms participating in the Pre-Proposal Conference and on-site process will not be directly compensated for their participation.  This solicitation will result in an award of the design and construction contract for the base bid.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals in phase-two will not be considered for award.  If discussions are required, they will be conducted with each offeror in the competitive range.  After a competitive range determination is made and final proposal revisions (if necessary) are received, a best value award decision will be made based on the base bid.  The Government will award the solicitation based on the most advantageous combination of price and technical factors that result in the overall best value awa! rd to the Government.
The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following six technical factors.  However, because this is a two-phase procurement, only the initial three technical factors will be used to form the evaluation of offerors in Phase 1.  A total of no more than five offerors, rated the best value under Factors 1 through 3, will proceed to Phase 2 in which both price and Factors 4 through 6 will be evaluated.
Phase 1:
Factor 1 - Corporate ExperienceFactor 2 - Past PerformanceFactor 3 - Small Business Subcontracting Past Performance
Phase 2:
Factor 4 - Technical SolutionFactor 5 - Management ApproachFactor 6 - Small Business Subcontracting Plan
The distinction between Corporate Experience (Factor 1) and Past Performance (Factor 2) is Corporate Experience pertains to the types of work and volume of work completed by a contractor that are comparable to the types of work covered by this requirement, in terms of size, scope, and complexity.  Past Performance relates to how well a contractor has performed.
The distinction between Subcontracting Past Performance (Factor 3) and Subcontracting Plan (Factor 6) is Past Performance pertains to how successful the offeror has been in meeting previously established Small Business Subcontracting goals.  Subcontracting Plan relates to how well the offeror intends to meet future Small Business Subcontracting goals.
The relative order of importance of the technical evaluation factors:  Factors 1 through 3 are approximately equal in importance to each other.  Factors 4 through 6 are approximately equal in importance to each other.  And the sum of Factors 1 through 6 is approximately equal in importance to Price.
Basis of Evaluation and Submittal Requirements for Each Factor.
Price:  To be evaluated in Phase 2 only.
Solicitation Submittal Requirements:  Offerors shall submit price proposals separate from technical Proposals.  One original and one copy of the price proposal shall be submitted in hard copy and shall include a completed schedule of prices for base bid CLIN 0001, a bid bond, completed representations and certifications or a printout of the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) report, and a completed and executed contract face page with acknowledgement of all amendments.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), Panama City, Florida intends to issue a modification to contract N61331-05-C-0012 with Detroit Diesel for additional FY09 MTU Mechanical and Electronics courses.  Specifically, NSWC-PCD has a requirement for one MTU Advanced Mechanical Class (W-5), two MTU Advanced Electronics Classes (CE-2), and one MTU Advanced Electronics Class (CE-3).  This requirement was only recently defined and was not known at the time the procurement quantities for contract N61331-05-C-0012 were established.  This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons:  These specialized training courses are for the maintenance of the MK V Special Operations Craft MTU engines.  MTU owns the proprietary information on the engines and engine electronics, which is inherent and required part of the training courses.  Detroit Diesel is MTU's only authorized American partner for this training.  For these re! asons, Detroit Diesel Corporation is uniquely qualified to fulfill this requirement.  NAICS 611699 FSC U006.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 336212   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in accordance with Federal Acquistion Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to award a sole source purchase order to the current provider Featherlite, Inc, for the procurement and installationof a Fume hood for the Cargo Trailer at EPA's Research Triangle Park Facility, North Carolina. It has been determined that this acquisition be awarded sole source based on the fact that down time and additional costs would be incurred by EPA in terms of replacement of equipment, training personnel for new equipment,  etc if a new vendor were to be chosen.  Market research has also shown that other companies offer service-only options but charge additional fees for service if their equipment is not used.  This would not be cost effective to the government.  This service is necessary to complete the Cargo Trailer.   The hood specifications are the following:
Labconco #3030000 "Fiberglass 30"Standard Model Fume Hood with Blower and Guardian Air Flow System and Epoxy Flat Work Surface
      The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is: 336212  If there are any other potential sources, submit your capability statement via email to the US Environmental Agency, c/o Mr. Micole Cheatham at cheatham.micole@epa.gov by 02/05/2009 4pm.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

We are exploring pricing variable levels of support into the E-9 CLS contract as part of this initiative and are seeking industry feedback and ideas on possible contracting options. The goal is to establish a flexible contract that allows the Government to adjust required level of support as needed without driving costs or significantly increasing the risks to the Contractor or the Government. The following scenario is for research purposes only and your candid answers will aid our strategy planning for the E-9 CLS contract.<br />1. Do you have capability to price incremental levels of support? For example, are you able to price two separate levels of Mission Capable (MC) and Non Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) support<br />a. Level I (standard); MC Rate 80%, NMCS rate 3%.<br />b. Level II (reduced); MC Rate 70%, NMCS rate 5% <br />2. Would there be a significant price difference at the Level I and Level II increments? If not, at what increment could the Government expect to see a price difference?<br />3. Could you conceivably adjust your level of support at the beginning of each FY based on a change in required MC/NMCS rates?<br />4. Do you foresee additional risks of pricing two levels of support? If so, briefly explain. <br />5. In your opinion, would the overall contract price increase, decrease, or remain the same if an incremental pricing structure was established versus pricing to support a single MC/NMCS rate?<br />6. Do you have other recommendations for making a CLS contract more flexible to accommodate variations in Government funding levels by fiscal year?</p>

<DESC><p>I. Description / Purpose:
<p>1. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California is contemplating the feasibility of acquiring a long-term, follow-on contract to the existing Spacelift Range System Contract (SLRS), which ends 31 October 2010. In addition to providing Launch and Test Range System (LTRS) sustainment, logistics, depot level maintenance, and options for LTRS product modifications, including modifications engineering, integration, and test, for both the Eastern Range (ER) and Western Range (WR), the Government intends to consolidate the above SLRS follow-on LTRS effort with the effort of the two existing ER &amp; WR support contracts for operations, scheduling, base support services, maintenance, downrange base operating support services, and other support (Eastern Range Technical Services (ERTS) &amp; Western Range Operation Communications and Information Contracts (WROCI)), thereby combining the above scope into a single "Launch and Test Range System (LTRS) Integrated Support Contract (LISC)" to meet the HQ AFSPC vision of improving LTRS efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed LISC effort is scheduled to commence in August 2010 and is envisioned to have a total budget of approximately $2-3 billion+ over 10 years. LRSW requests interested, qualified sources to respond to this RFI with a White Paper as detailed below.</p>
<p>2. The LTRS consists of the ER, headquartered at Patrick AFB in Florida, and the WR, headquartered at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The LTRS is comprised of a network of equipment within 12 different subsystems which must function in concert to fulfill mission requirements. These 12 subsystems are: Command Destruct, Communications, Data Handling, Safety, Optics, Planning &amp; Scheduling, Radar, Surveillance, Timing &amp; Sequencing, Telemetry, Weather, and Modeling and Simulation.</p>
<p>3. Please be advised this is a request for information only, and does not obligate the Government to reimburse any cost associated with preparation and/or submission of this information. Nor does the RFI guarantee the Government will issue your company a Request for Proposal (RFP) or award a contract for supplies or services. Instructions for submittals are provided below. The Government may use information submitted by respondents to this RFI to help assess the feasibility of a LISC acquisition and to assist in developing effective industry incentives for a LISC acquisition strategy. A subsequent LISC RFI #2 is envisioned to further understand industry capabilities and enhance the contemplated LISC acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>4. The contemplated LISC would provide the Government with a single prime contractor responsible and accountable for complete and integrated LTRS operations, scheduling, organizational level maintenance, depot level maintenance (consistent with USAF &amp; AFSPC 2-level maintenance policies), sustainment, logistics, base support services, downrange base operating support services, and optional LTRS modifications at both ER &amp; WR. It is envisioned that the LISC would improve efficiencies and reduce Operating and Maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, leveraging the advantages of a single responsible contractor approach to LTRS (ER &amp; WR) support and management, e.g., seamless, problem-free transitions of products (including training, certifications, and associated technical data) from modifications phase to operational acceptance. Public safety, mission success, assured access to space as well as improving operational and test support is of prime interest to the Government. Following OSD &amp; AFSPC guidance, the LISC shall implement Performance Based Logistics for Space (PBL-S) and contract incentives that: 1) ensure rigorous and objective LTRS reliability, maintainability, and availability (RMA) data preparation, measurements, and collection, and 2) ensure ER &amp; WR are "green" (operational) throughout each "launch and test campaign" at the lowest price to Government. Moreover, the LISC requires a contract incentive structure that is immediately responsive to LTRS dynamics, such as LTRS assets decommissions, relocations, and additions.</p>
<p>II. White Paper Content: Interested industry respondents are requested to provide a White Paper that includes answers/information with regards to the following questions/requests:</p>
<p>1. Maintaining a 24/7 operational LTRS<br />a. Present an approach to maximize range flexibility in both launch and test campaigns at minimum manning.<br />b. Present a proposed skill set required to achieve optimum LTRS flexibility.<br />c. Present an approach that facilitates common data management tools across the LTRS that results in standard data products and reports for both ER and WR.<br />d. Present an approach to deconflicting multiple range missions that may occur simultaneously. <br />e. Present an approach to implementing Performance-Based Logistics for Space (PBL-S) into LTRS.<br />f. Present a singular management and communication approach that encompasses all LTRS operating/support locations and organizations.</p>
<p>2. LTRS transformation <br />a. Present an approach to effectively decommission LTRS assets while ensuring a 24/7 operational LTRS.<br />b. Provide examples of how your company has managed large-scale transformation on other programs, to include the decommission of assets while maintaining operational capability.</p>
<p>3. LISC implementation<br />a. Present an approach to incentivize successful implementation of PBL-S, objective RMA data collection, and launch and test campaign successes (including simultaneous campaigns at each Range), at lowest price to the Government.<br />b. Present a LISC contract incentive structure that is immediately responsive to LTRS dynamics, such as LTRS assets decommissions, relocations, and additions, over the life of LISC.<br />c. Present suggestions for contract type and CLIN structure.<br />d. Present an approach to potential price incentives. Provide examples where appropriate.<br />e. Identify opportunities for small business participation with your approach. Provide the methodology used to make this determination</p>
<p>4. Identify the top 3 challenges associated with the LISC contract consolidation and present an effective risk mitigation strategy. Provide examples where appropriate.</p>
<p>5. Identify any perceived or actual Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) associated with this effort with respect to other current and future LTRS contracts (see also "LTRS SE&amp;I" Solicitation FA8811-09-R-0001).</p>
<p>III. Industry Days: An industry day session may be scheduled, based on the results of the RFI. RFI respondents may be invited to participate in supplemental industry day one-on-one discussions with the Government to discuss their White Paper information in greater detail. However, failure to respond to the RFI does not preclude proposal submittal nor industry day participation if a formal acquisition is announced.</p>
<p>IV. Small Business Consideration: The Small Business size standard is: 1,000 employees. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, HUBZone, historically black colleges, and minority institutions. The Small Business point of contact is Mr. Willard Strozier at 310-653-1108.</p>
<p>V. White Paper Classification: Respondents shall provide an unclassified, non-proprietary response to this RFI.</p>
<p>VI. White Paper Format: Responses shall not exceed fifty (50) pages; the Government will not consider pages in excess of 50 pages. Page size shall be 8.5 x 11; font size shall be 12 pt. The White Paper cover page and table of contents pages will not count against the page limit. The Government may not accept company literature or marketing materials.</p>

IV. POSITION ELEMENTS



1. Supervision Received: The DPCIT will report to the PCIT and will receive general guidance from that individual.

The DPCIT may encounter difficulty in identifying the exact nature of the relevant issues or problems and in planning, organizing, and determining the scope and depth of tasks, studies and/or audits to be undertaken, due to the complexity, high visibility and/or political sensitivity related to many issues with which the NAS is involved. The work may require the incumbent to establish new concepts or programs and to expend considerable effort to resolve previously unyielding problems. 

5. Scope and Effectiveness: The DPCIT performs a broad range of tasks related to a complex foreign assistance program in Mexico. NAS programs have a significant impact on embassy operations including those of other USG agencies. An essential part of the complexity will be the identification of the project parameters with the GOM counterpart(s) and the subsequent negotiation of goals. 

6. Personal Contacts: The DPCIT will work closely with NAS personnel, the Embassys Management Section, other USG LEA agencies within the Mission, contractors implementing NAS projects and GOM counterparts.

Installation Description

The natural gas distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

Entergy supplies natural gas to Little Rock AFB at one primary connection located at the Bases southern boundary. This connection point is composed of a pressure regulation and metering station inside a structure located within a fenced area owned by Entergy. Odorization is provided by the natural gas supplier. There are no Government-owned odorization facilities associated with the natural gas system included in the Utilities Privatization solicitation.
The main regulation station owned by Entergy regulates the natural gas supply pressure to the seasonal operational pressure of 20 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) in the summer and 45 psig in the winter. Service regulators accomplish further reduction in pressure to between 8 and 11 inches of water or to the pressure required by specific operations. 
Natural gas is used to meet space and water heating requirements in non-residential buildings on Base. MFH units are not currently served by the natural gas distribution system.
The natural gas distribution system at Little Rock AFB consists of piping mains, valves, vaults, valve boxes, service lines, service regulators, meters, and impressed current and sacrificial anode cathodic protection systems for metallic piping and valves. Approximately 58 percent of the piping is original steel piping from the 1950s. The natural gas distribution system was originally constructed in the mid 1950s and has since been expanded to handle increased system demands. Replacement of the original metallic piping with polyethylene (PE) piping, which is the preferred material for current replacements, began in the mid 1970s. Standard installation practices are to install tracer wire or tape with plastic piping; however, it is not known for certain if all plastic piping was installed with tracer wire or tape. It is estimated that approximately 70 percent of the plastic piping was installed with tracer wire or tape.
The average burial depth for buried natural gas system infrastructure is estimated at 3 feet below ground surface. This burial depth was estimated and there may be areas of the Base with deeper burial depths. For example, portions of the system along Chief Williams drive are as deep as 9 feet below ground surface. The prevailing subsurface at Little Rock AFB is rock and/or slate. Overall, approximately 5 percent of the system is underneath paved surfaces. 
The distribution system serving the majority of the Base has a 6-inch diameter steel pipe loop with lateral taps off the loop. A 2-inch diameter PE pipe loop services the east side of the Base and connects to the main 6-inch loop at two points. The majority of the system can be fed from at least two different paths. In addition to the PE pipe on east side of the system, service lines to the buildings are replaced with PE pipe when replacement is warranted. 
Little Rock AFB has approximately 130,600 lf of piping (mains and services to the facilities). The diameter of the piping ranges from  to 8 inches in diameter. Each building served by the natural gas system (not all buildings on Base are served) has at least one regulator to lower the gas pressure for equipment and appliance use. There are no district pressure regulator stations. Meters are used for internal charging (reimbursement) and energy management. Currently, all the Base-owned meters are read through a service contract.
Entergy performs an annual leakage survey under a service contract through the Base Civil Engineer. At times, this contract has included provisions to make repairs to the system as leaks were identified. The sole-source contract award to Entergy calls for a leak-survey report, categorization of the detected leaks, notifying Base infrastructure personnel of leaks requiring immediate attention, and providing a cost estimate for each repair needed to the system. Overall, there are few leaks in the majority of the system. Most of the leak-repair work is due to contractor excavations. If the natural gas system being solicited is privatized, the sole source leak-survey contract and the meter-reading contract will be discontinued on contract start date.
The Little Rock AFB natural gas distribution system utilizes both impressed current and sacrificial anode cathodic protection systems to minimize corrosion. Readings of the cathodic protection rectifiers are taken monthly. Copies of the readings are maintained in a data repository and summarized in an annual report. A copy of the performance survey data is included in the Bidders Library. 

The water distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

Little Rock AFB purchases drinking water from the City of Jacksonville water system. Lake Winona and Lake Maumelle are two of the water sources the City of Jacksonville (Arkansas) Water Department uses to provide drinking water. The City also uses 11 wells in Lonoke County to provide drinking water. Little Rock AFBs drinking water comes from lakes and is not mixed with well water; the lake water is conveyed through several water systems before reaching Little Rock AFB. 
The primary connection to Jacksonvilles system is from the Citys 5-million gallon (MG) storage tank that is located adjacent to the south perimeter of the Bases area. Water flows by gravity from the Citys storage tank to the Bases low-pressure transfer pump station at Facility 2998 through a 16-inch ductile-iron water pipe with cement-mortar lining. The water is metered as it enters the low-pressure pump station. A second emergency connection is located south of Facility 1078 and is connected to the City of Jacksonvilles 12 inch water main that runs along the Bases perimeter. This second emergency connection is also metered. Additionally, a third connection point supplies water to the golf course irrigation system. The piping associated with this third connection point is not part of the UP Solicitation.
The low-pressure transfer pump station (Facility 2998) pumps water into the Bases main storage reservoir. The water is pumped by two centrifugal variable speed pumps, each with individual capacity of 2,214 gallons per minute (gpm). System controls limit operations to one pump; the second pump is reserved as a backup pump. The pumps typically operate at about 1,700 gpm. The Bases main storage reservoir is a 1.28-MG ground-level storage reservoir adjacent to Facility 570 (high-service pump station). 
The high-service pump station (Facility 570) houses three centrifugal pumps and the Bases water treatment (disinfection) system. The high-service pump station pumps water into the Bases water distribution system using two pumps in a rotating sequence. One of the centrifugal pumps is rated at 600 gpm and two are rated at 1,100 gpm. The pumps are operated in parallel with Pump 1 (the 600-gpm pump) as the principal pump since the disinfection system is connected to that pump. The Base uses mixed-oxidant solution for disinfection. The other two pumps provide additional support to Pump 1. 
The water distribution system also includes one recirculation pump station (Facility 1373). The pump moves water through the flightline area of the Base and reduces the stagnation and residual low-disinfectant water. 
The water distribution system consists of approximately 43.4 miles of buried water main piping (which ranges in size from 6 to 16 inches). Three types of piping material are used for water mains at Little Rock AFB: approximately 80,400 linear feet (lf) of cast-iron pipe was installed in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s; 7,900 lf of ductile iron pipe with cement-mortar lining installed in the 2000s; and about 141,400 lf of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe has been installed since the 1980s. PVC is the material of choice for water-line replacement. Standard installation practices are to install tracer wire or marking tape with PVC piping mains. Nearly all mains have been installed with tracer wire or marking tape. Water mains are typically installed with a 4-foot burial depth and approximately 5 percent of the system is underneath paved surfaces. The prevailing subsurface at Little Rock AFB is rock and/or slate.
In addition to the water mains, the water distribution system consists of approximately 9.6 miles buried service lines (which range in size from 3/4-inch service lines to 4-inch water lines). Four types of material are used for service lines at Little Rock AFB: approximately 1,700 lf of cast-iron piping, 1,900 lf of galvanized steel piping, 22,700 lf of copper piping, and 24,300 lf of PVC piping installed from the 1940s through the 2000s. All four types of service lines are currently in operation.
Three water-storage tanks support the potable water-storage requirements for Little Rock AFB. One ground-level storage reservoir with a capacity of 1.28 MG (Tank 578) and two horizontal hydro-pneumatic tanks (Tanks 572 and 574), each with a storage capacity of 30,000 gallons, provide water for daily residential, industrial, and fire-fighting demands throughout the Base. The three main potable water storage tanks (Tanks 572, 574, and 578) are protected with cathodic protection systems.
Little Rock AFB provides limited water treatment. The Base provides disinfection treatment and corrosion control. The other water quality requirements are controlled by the City of Jacksonville. Little Rock AFB is within compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Disinfection and Disinfection By-product Regulations; however, trihalomethane (THM) concentrations at several locations are very close to exceeding the standard during the warm summer months.  This is due to the warm water temperature and the long time (over 10 days) chlorine is in contact with the water.  Little Rock AFB recommends UP Contractor continue managing chlorine residuals through operational controls already in place; and develop measures to increase water usage to reduce water age.
The following bullets summarize known conditions the Government has observed for the Little Rock AFB water distribution system. The conditions listed represent items of concern that may impact the systems ability to maintain reliable service and water quality. The following conditions may not include all items of concern on the system that could impact the systems reliability and are provided to illustrate a general understanding of the systems condition. If the system is sold, the Government will not address these conditions.
	Elimination of all dead end loops - Work Order Q8570, use of H2O MAP for re-design and engineering.
	CAWS Connection  Work Order R4715, H2O MAP designed/ cost estimated, work with City for possible window usage (early summer 5 million gallon tank bypass).
	SCADA Expansion  Identify problem areas (low flow. Excessive water age, low chlorine, pH variance, metering sites for I&I Review) once SCADA is installed and use H2O MAP to design improvements.
	Replace Pump Station 570  recommended by AFIOH study.
	Interim Plan - Provide a temporary bypass around the 5 million gallon reservoir during late spring and early summer (periods when THM formation is the highest), continue water main flushing, develop unidirectional flushing program, continue to monitor THMs in residential areas and flush water mains when concentrations are too high or chlorine levels are too low, and manage chlorine residuals throughout the distribution system both manually and with SCADA system.

The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: 

The wastewater collection system at Little Rock AFB consists of approximately 198,700 linear feet (lf) of gravity collection mains and services, 31,400 lf of force mains, 20 lift stations, and 860 manholes. There are no wastewater treatment facilities on the Installation. The City of Jacksonville, Arkansas, treats the Bases wastewater at its wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).
There are fourteen wastewater meters, including the billing meter at the discharge to the City of Jacksonville, located throughout the wastewater collection system. Six of these metered locations, including the billing meter, also have automatic samplers associated with them. Thirteen of the flow meters and five of the samplers are located at strategic points within the collection system to address the I/I issues on the installation and to track discharge permit exceedances, if they occur. The off-Base billing meter and associated sampler is located at the end of the Base-owned pipeline in a meter vault approximately 2 miles south of the Base boundary on South Redmond Road. Currently, all these Base-owned meters are maintained through a service contract.
Vitrified clay and concrete pipe was used extensively to construct the system when the Base was built in the mid 1950s, and they are still the most common pipe type in the system. Over 50 percent of the vitrified clay mains have been slip-lined. It is not known if any tracer wire or tape was used when collection piping was installed. It is assumed that there is no tracer wire or tape for any wastewater collection piping.
The average burial depth for buried infrastructure is 10 feet below ground surface. This burial depth was estimated and there are areas of the Base with deeper burial depths. The prevailing subsurface at Little Rock AFB is rock and/or slate. Overall, approximately 20 percent of the system is underneath paved surfaces. 
The 20 lift stations vary by type, but most are either submersible or flooded-suction type. Two of the lift stations (270 and 3001) are primary lift stations; the remaining 18 lift stations service individual buildings or groups of buildings. The lift stations at Buildings 122, 126, 270, 590 (Fam Camp), 1378, 1500, and 3001 are new and are in very good condition. The stations at Buildings 118, 249, 392, 1342, and 1994 are not new, but are in good condition. Other lift stations are located at Building 110A, 162 (supporting Building 160), 258, 294, 298, 1585, 1706, and 1714, condition unknown. 
The manholes are generally the same age as the pipelines. Most of the manholes are constructed of tile or brick, but newer installations are made of pre-cast concrete sections. Older brick manholes are currently being rehabilitated by installing liners to reduce infiltration and inflow (I/I).
Wastewater from Base housing empties into a force main, which sends the wastewater to a lift station. From the lift station, the piping turns to 15-inch gravity main. From main Base, the wastewater empties into a 12-inch force main, which transitions to a 15-inch gravity line from another pump station. Both sets of wastewater flows then enter a common 15-inch line. The 15-inch line transitions to a 24-inch line at Manhole 0-39A.  From the Base boundary, the waste is conveyed through approximately 2 miles of pipe, which is owned and maintained by the Base, to the Jacksonville WWTP.
Little Rock AFB performed extensive closed-circuit television (CCTV) inspections in MFH starting in 1985. Based on the results of the CCTV inspection a significant portion of the mains in MFH were slip-lined. More recently, Little Rock AFB initiated a program to inspect buried piping and manholes using CCTV and performed a system-wide capacity study in 2005. The CCTV inspection program was developed in response to notification from the City of Jacksonville to reduce the Bases I/I rate. The average wastewater discharge at the outfall for the last 5 fiscal years is approximately 1.23 million gallons per day (mgd). During this same period, Little Rock AFB purchased an average of approximately 0.65 mgd of potable water from the City of Jacksonville. 
The program to inspect buried piping and manholes consists of using CCTV to inspect the buried piping in an area of the Base. Following an evaluation of the CCTV logs to identify, locate, and categorize the deficiencies, the Base prepares and bids a contract to correct the deficiencies. Piping corrections can include point repairs, slip-lining a segment between manholes, or replacing complete sections of pipe. 
Three projects have been completed under the program to date. The first two projects included two areas within the MFH portion of the Base, which was identified in 1985 as the area with the highest I/I contribution. The third project, completed in 2006, corrected deficiencies identified with the main trunk line adjacent to the tarmac in the East Flightline Area. The amount of infrastructure inspected and repaired for each project varies based on available funding.
The CCTV data collected to date provides information on the functionality of the pipe, pipe material, pipe size, pipe sags, joint conditions, debris in the pipe, active service taps, root intrusion, and evidence of infiltration or ex-filtration. Identified deficiencies include cracks in the pipe, separated joints, offset joints, and leakage inside manholes. Pipe repairs include point repairs, replacement of segments of pipe, and resealing penetrations into manholes. In at least three instances, the entire segments of piping between manholes have been replaced as part of the three completed projects.
The CCTV information indicates the older lines that have not been slip-lined are in poor condition and should be replaced. Based on the CCTV logs, it is assumed that older vitrified clay, cast-iron, and concrete lines that were not evaluated using CCTV technology probably also require replacement. 
Point failures in slip-lined and new polyvinyl chloride (PVC) segments of piping have also been identified in the available data. The identified deficiencies are not as common; however, a significant number of the deficiencies in the slip-lined and PVC pipe are at manhole penetrations and joint locations. Little Rock AFB appears to be experiencing differential settlement along the system, which results in offset joints and construction phasing problems.
A hydraulic capacity study was completed between 25 October 2005 and 15 January 2006. The study divided the Base into five sub areas. Flow meters were installed in the exit manhole for each sub-area. The flow data was evaluated and an analysis of the dry weather flow and rainfall-dependent infiltration and inflow (RDII) coefficient for I/I during rainfall events was determined for each sub area. The measured average dry weather flow from the study reasonably aligns with the last 2.5 years of wastewater meter readings at the outfall to the City of Jacksonville. 
The normalized RDII values on a gallon per inch of rainfall per foot of pipe for the five sub areas can be an indication of areas on the Base that may have I/I issues. The larger the RDII value, the greater the contribution to I/I that would be expected to enter the system. Normalized RDII on a per-inch-of-rainfall-per-foot-of-pipe basis for the five sub-areas were as follows:
	T1 (East Flightline area), RDII=3.20
	TS2 (South Maintenance area), RDII=1.13
	T3 (West Flightline area), RDII=0.37
	T4 (MFH), RDII=2.97
	T5 (Administrative and commercial area), RDII=4.56
The highest potential contributing area to I/I would be expected to be the T5 area. This area has the largest percentage of older pipe that has not been slip-lined or repaired. 
The RDII value for the T4 area appears higher than expected, based on the fact that two recent upgrade projects were completed in this area prior to performing the capacity study. However, the northwest corner of the MFH area and the piping extending from the east edge of the MFH area to the main trunk line exiting the Base have not been inspected or repaired; these areas are included in the T4 area. 
The third repair project, East Flightline Area, had not been completed prior to the capacity study; therefore, the RDII value for the T1 area may now be lower than shown.  
Sub areas T1 and TS2 also contain older pipe and manholes that have not been rehabilitated.
The collection system experiences frequent grease build up in several of the collection mains. Little Rock AFB currently maintains an annual line inspection and cleaning program to remove the grease build up and prevent stoppages. The Base also installs enzyme socks in manholes along problem sections to assist in reducing grease build up.
Current system operation has resulted in occasional discharge permit exceedances, especially for total suspended solids (TSS). Almost all TSS exceedances historically, have been associated with contractor break-ins (unexpectedly breaking the line during new construction) and failed piping resulting in solids entering the line. Little Rock AFB currently has a dig-permit process to reduce the number of break-ins.
Housing units at Little Rock AFB have been privatized. The Housing Privatization Contractor is responsible for all service lines from the houses up to the main lines.

<SUBJECT>Perform Preliminary Programming Study for New Ecological and Analytical Laboratory, Beaufort, NC.
<SOLNBR>WC1330-03-CQ-0009TO41SSN
<RESPDATE>031510
<CONTACT>Phyllis R. Jackson, Contract Specialist, Phone 816-426-7464, Fax 816-274-6998, Email phyllis.r.jackson@noaa.gov - Jackie S Smith, Procurement Technician, Phone 816-426-2068, Fax 816-274-6828, Email jacqueline.s.smith@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>This Sources Sought Notice is issued for the purpose of identifying and determining the availability of sources capable of performing preliminary programming study services. The action for which these services are required is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), Ecological and Analytical Laboratory Project at the Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research (CCFHR), Beaufort, NC.
<p>Project Scope: NOAA is in the process of completing its Master Planning Study for its programs and facilities on Pivers Island in Beaufort, NC. The Master Planning Study was contracted with Gibbens Drake Scott, Inc. (GDS), Raytown, MO, on September 12, 2007, under Task Order (T.O.) Number T0043 issued against Contract Number WC1330-03-CQ-0009. Initially, it was believed that a new Wet Laboratory was the most urgent site redevelopment project. To that end, T.O. Number T0041 against WC1330-03-CQ-0009 was issued to GDS, also on September 18, 2007, for creation of design-build (DB) bridging documents for construction of a new Wet Lab. The Wet Lab bridging document effort was proceeding concurrently with the master planning activities. However, in the later stages of the master planning process, it has been determined that a major shift in focus is needed to most effectively use available space and to best schedule construction activities at the site.</p>
<p>It was found that NOS will be better served by placing the Wet Lab where the existing Administration/Fisheries building is presently located. Before that can be done, the existing Administration/Fisheries (Tee Wing) building and adjoining two-story Ecology Wing building must be razed and removed. In anticipation of that project, the new Ecological and Analytical Lab would have to be designed and constructed in order to relocate personnel from the Administration/ Fisheries building and the Ecology Wing to the new Ecological and Analytical Lab prior to the demolition of the existing structures. For those reasons, the new Ecological and Analytical Lab has come to the forefront as the construction priority in the revised master planning phasing.</p>
<p>Because the new Ecological and Analytical Lab was not originally intended to be in Phase 1 of the NOS Beaufort master plan, NOAA does not yet have valid programming information for it. Therefore, a Preliminary Program Study for the new Ecological Analytical Lab at this time in planning is required to confirm the fundamental design information and subsequent cost estimates developed in the master plan and ensure management support in moving forward with the overall master planning objectives. The required work will involve an analysis of the required spaces to meet the functional and operational needs of the facility and an outline of the functions, users' needs, goals, budget, programmatic constraints, and site requirements. The available budget for all design and construction effort is between $18.5 million and $22.5 million. Occupancy is planned for October 2013.</p>
<p>Initial master planning has already determined that the Ecological and Analytical Lab will combine the programs of the Field Ecology and Forecasting Laboratory with the Analytical Laboratory into one building program. The estimated space requirement for the combined programs is approximately 34,000 square feet. It will need to house approximately 70 staff members. The preliminary cost estimate for this new lab building is $16,767,325 (excluding site work, geothermal wells, and other exterior preparations). However the allocation of square footage for this building is based upon a calculated determination by current NOS/CCFHR staff. That calculation reflects existing and planned laboratory operations, and will need to be further defined during programming and preliminary design phases for this building. This research laboratory will be used for analyzing data and material collected in the Wet Lab and in the field. The building must be physically separated from the Wet Lab because the Analytical Lab contains instruments that are highly sensitive to salt water aerosol, and salt water aerosol is prevalent in the Wet Lab. Based on the Master Plan effort, the Ecological and Analytical Laboratory site selection, site improvements, site civil and mechanical utilities, and site electrical utilities requirements have been completed and building selection recommendations for materials, substructure, superstructure, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and plumbing criteria have been established.</p>
<p>Basis for Evaluation: Responses to this announcement will be evaluated based on the following criteria presented in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>1. Familiarity with the site and with the established NOS programs and facilities at that location.<br />2. Documented recent experience in the planning and design of NOAA laboratories, full-service hospitals, or similar facilities, to include associated complex HVAC and mechanical systems.<br />3. Documented experience in performing and successfully completing comparable projects in coastal North Carolina.<br />4. Proven established subcontracting relationships on comparable recent projects.<br />5. Proven ability to successfully complete comparable recent projects at the required quality level, on schedule, and within budget.<br />6. Documented LEED experience on comparable projects.</p>
<p>Submission of Responses: Sources can be a partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity having full contractual responsibility for the project. To be responsive to this sources sought notice, interested parties must submit the following documentation:</p>
<p>1. Evidence of successful experience on AE projects of similar type and scope during the past five years. Evidence must include contract numbers, project titles, total project dollar values, and points of contact with current contact information to include telephone and facsimile numbers and e-mail addresses. More importance will be assigned to more recent experience with NOS programs and facilities at the Beaufort location and at other NOAA laboratories.<br />2. Evidence of experience in performing and successfully completing comparable projects in coastal North Carolina. More importance will be assigned to more recent experience<br />3. Evidence of established subcontracting relationships on comparable recent projects.<br />4. Evidence of ability to successfully complete comparable recent projects at the required quality level, on schedule, and within budget.<br />5. Evidence of successful implementation of LEED criteria and principles on recent comparable projects.<br />6. Evidence of current Central Contractor Registration (CCR) documenting size status and other socioeconomic qualifications.<br />7. A positive statement of intention to submit an offer as a prime contractor under any resulting solicitation.<br /><br />Submissions provided in response to this notice shall be no more than fifteen typed 8 and &frac12;-inch by 11-inch pages, excluding resumes. Submissions will not be returned. All submissions received will be evaluated by qualified NOAA professionals.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals. Nor is it an offer to contract or a Phase One solicitation for qualification statements. This announcement does not create any obligation whatsoever on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses to this notice nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this notice. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government's evaluation of the information received. It is anticipated that a single best value negotiated solicitation for the entire programming study effort will be issued for this project. It is expected that it will result in a firm fixed-price contract award.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.</p>
<p>
<p>The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) on the behalf of National Institute of Standards and Technology/Office of Law Enforcement Standards (NIST/OLES) is conducting market research to determine sources for the following equipment. The anticipated North American Industry Classification system Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 334220 Radio and Television Broadcasting and wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing with a size standard of 750 employees. The Government anticipates award of a contract in the 2nd or 3rd quarter of 2009.</p>
<p>ISSI Based Project 25 Trunked Infrastructure</p>
<p>1. Project Overview</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) on the behalf of National Institute of Standards and Technology/Office of Law Enforcement Standards (NIST/OLES) is in the process of building out a laboratory that includes Project 25 (P25) infrastructure manufactured by different vendors that is capable of interoperating via the Inter-RF Sub-System Interface (ISSI). We would like information on P25 trunked ISSI capable systems. Since we currently have an ISSI based P25 trunked system manufactured by EADS, we are interested in obtaining information about other vendors' ISSI based P25 trunked systems. An example of some of the major components that the terms infrastructure and system refer to in this context are the Radio Frequency Sub-System (RFSS) (a.k.a. base station controller, site controller, system controller, etc.), trunked P25 base stations, ISSI interface, and Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OA&amp;M) interface, etc. It should be clearly noted that this infrastructure will be used by ITS for research and test purposes only. The intent is not to support mission critical traffic using this infrastructure. The purpose of this market research process is to determine what companies offer ISSI based P25 trunked infrastructure that may fulfill the needs of ITS. This is a Request For Information (RFI) announcement and NOT A SOLICITATION. The responses provided by the vendors will allow us to compile the necessary information in order to make informed choices on ISSI based P25 trunked infrastructure.</p>
<p>2. Disclaimer</p>
<p>It should be fully understood by all companies who provide responses to this document that this is in no way is an endorsement from ITS. The information given to ITS is strictly for research purposes. At no time should press releases or any type of sales brochures references be made with regards to this process.</p>
<p>It should also be understood that any and all information provided, unless specifically noted by the company, could be made available to the public in the future. If specific information is covered by an existing NDA, this should be clearly described in the reply.</p>
<p><br />3. Band of Operation</p>
<p>The frequency bands that Project 25 systems typically are capable of operating in is VHF, UHF, and 800MHz. ITS would like the infrastructure to be capable of operating in UHF band since we currently have licensed frequency pairs in this band. However, for future purposes, we'd like information on how the different manufacturers would go about converting the system to operate in the 800MHz or VHF bands. If a forklift upgrade is required, in your response, please indicate that this is the case.</p>
<p>4. Request For Information Questions</p>
<p>The next several sections contain questions and requirement statements on the specific information we need to gather on ISSI based P25 trunked infrastructure. Please provide information about your current or future products that can address these questions and statements. For all questions and requirements, if your product does not currently support a particular feature or function please indicate when you anticipate the feature/function in question will be available.</p>

<DESC>Document Type:  Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI)<BR>Solicitation Number:  W900KK-09-R-0002<BR>Response Date:  1600 hours (EST), 13 February, 2009<BR>Classification Code: 6910<BR>Set-Aside:  NA<BR>NAICS Code 333319<BR>Estimated Value:  $500M<BR>Period of Performance:  One year base plus four-one year options.<BR>Anticipated Place of Performance:  CONUS & OCONUS  <BR><BR>Title:  Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Single Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Live Training Contract.  <BR><BR>Description:  PEO STRI Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manger for Digitized Training (DT) anticipates numerous live training requirements for instrumentation and associated equipment, spares, training, and maintenance support for Integrated Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT) Training Systems (IMTS), Mobile MOUT, and Combat Training Center MOUT Instrumentation System (CTC MOUT-IS) under Urban Operations. <BR> <BR> The intent of Urban Operations is to provide dynamic, modular and scalable solutions to fulfill various aspects of individual, collective, and combined arms training.  Urban Operations encompasses more than traditional going-to-war training; it also addresses other-than-war operations (such as peacekeeping missions), and homeland defense and anti-terrorism scenarios.  Urban Operations supports both fixed-permanent and non-permanent structure facilities, allows for the additional expansion to existing facilities, integration across sites and mission domains, and supports the continuation of instrumentation and data processing growth commensurate with tactical systems.  This equipment will provide an instrumentable Live Training Capability for the Soldier.  The Urban Operations environment completely immerses the training participant into the realism of the event, and it becomes indistinguishable from real life environments.  The Urban Operations environment allows and supports flexibility and changing of scenarios to prevent learned responses vice learning benefits.  The Urban Operations environment allows for the inclusion of the unexpected, unplanned, and uncontrolled events, and trains learning, not conditioning.   <BR><BR>The Integrated-Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT) Training System (IMTS) consists of three training facilities/systems:  1)  the Urban Assault Course (UAC);  2) Shoot house (SH); and  3)Combined Arms Collective Training Facility (CACTF), all of which are designed to provide individual through battalion-level, homestation, and urban operations training. These new training facilities will allow units to train Soldiers on building entry and room clearing techniques under live and blank-fire conditions and limited subterranean training in an urban training facility large enough to conduct combined arms force-on-force collective training at the battalion/task force level. These urban training facilities that are located across the Army ensure that Soldiers are prepared to conduct full-spectrum operations in any urban environment. By providing state-of the-art urban training facilities capable of training todays Soldiers in a realistic urban environment, this system ensures that they have the highest level of training experience.  Lessons are learned on the training ground and not in the battle. These systems monitor and control the training exercise, process, display, and analyze collected exercise data, prepare and present standardized training performance feedback, and archive training performance information for external use. <BR> <BR> The Mobile Military Operations on Urban Terrain Training System (MOUT) is a transportable urban combat training system consisting of reconfigurable shipping containers assembled into urban structures. Urban structures are fitted with audio/video instrumentation systems, exercise control and monitoring, and After Action Review (AAR) presentation capability. Urban structures can be multi-story with interior/exterior stairwells and may include balconies and trap doors leading to subterranean storage areas or tunnel complexes. In its fully instrumented configuration, the system allows realistic battlefield effects (smoke, sounds, smells, pyrotechnics, etc.) and provides video and audio of Soldiers being trained to allow for rapid AAR.  The Mobile MOUT provides a rapidly fielded, deployable urban operations training system that allows Soldiers to improve their tactics, techniques, and procedures and to conduct mission rehearsals practicing force-on-force or force-on-target while utilizing Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES), blanks, man-marker rounds, or Short-Range Training Ammunition (SRTA).<BR><BR>The CTC MOUT-IS project initially provides the National Training Center National Urban Warfare Complex (NTC NUWC) with an instrumentation system to support 200 - 400 urban structures.  The instrumentation will include audio/video instrumentation systems, exercise control and monitoring, and after action review editing, production, and presentation capability.  In FY12 the project then shifts to tech refresh of the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) and Joint Multi-National Readiness Center (JMRC) MOUT-IS systems.<BR><BR>These systems will support the full range of Urban Operations live training requirements, from individual training to collective training at various ranges around the world.  The Government intends to award a single award ID/IQ contract in FY 2009 with a five year period of performance (one year base with four one-year options) with a Not-To-Exceed value of approximately $500 million USD.  The award of this contract will be made on a Best-Value basis.  See the Urban Operations draft statement of work for more information regarding desired capabilities.

<DESC><p>COMMERCIAL SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE<br />________________________________________<br />GENERAL INFORMATION<br />Document Type: Request for Information and Sources Sought Notice <br />Solicitation Number: MSC-NGW<br />Posted Date: 02 February 2009<br />Original Response Date: 03 March 2009<br />Current Response Date: 03 March 2009<br />Original Archive Date: 24 March 2009<br />Current Archive Date: 24 March 2009<br />Classification Code: D - Information Technology Services, including Telecommunications Services<br />NAICS Code: 517410 - Satellite Telecommunications Carriers/Resellers
<p>DESCRIPTION<br />PURPOSE: The purpose of publishing this notice is two-fold. First, it is a Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research which will be used to formulate an acquisition strategy for turnkey "solution provider engineered" space segment services, supporting hardware/software, and lifecycle support services necessary to provide end-to-end Internet Protocol (IP) communications connecting the global Military Sealift Command (MSC) maritime/mobile platforms to the two fixed shore-side MSC Continental United States (CONUS) Network Operation Centers (NOCs). This should be an all-inclusive integrated solution that will require minimum MSC effort to install, operate, and maintain.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is a sources sought notice for small businesses that can provide the required services under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 517410, Satellite Telecommunications Carriers/Resellers. All small businesses to include Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone, Women-Owned and Service Disabled are strongly encouraged to provide timely responses to this RFI. A response to this RFI will assist DISA in determining the potential levels of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability within the small business community to provide the required services. In addition, this information will be used to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract/small business participation plan small business goal percentages. This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued to assist the agency in performing market research to determine whether there are qualified and capable small businesses to provide turnkey commercial satellite communications service to MSC.</p>
<p>Request small business respond and discuss your company's ability to perform in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting clause (FAR 52.219-14). Interested small businesses meeting the small business standard of NAICS code 517410 are requested to submit a response to this RFI. Please include your DUNS number and CAGE code and a statement of self-certification under the NAICS code. Request your response include recent (within the past 5 years) and relevant experience (work similar in type and scope) to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers where the offeror performed the relevant work. Although marketing brochures and generic company literature may contain pertinent information, these would not be sufficient for the Government to determine capability of the business to perform the scope of work required.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal or a promise to issue a Request for Proposal in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Respondents are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>TARGET AUDIENCE: Satellite operators, managed service providers, and satellite system engineering and integration resellers and integrators who can integrate and provide turnkey end-to-end integrated Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) services, infrastructure, and operations for MSC. In particular, small businesses are requested to respond to this RFI to assist MSC in formulating an acquisition strategy that fairly considers small business ability to participate in the acquisition, either as prime contractors or as subcontractors.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: COMSATCOM is an essential component of today's DoD communications. Current capacity of on-orbit Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) systems cannot meet the increasing communications demands of the joint warfighters.</p>
<p>MSC intends to implement the Next Generation Wideband (NGW) technology to replace/upgrade the current MSC Afloat Bandwidth Efficient Satellite Transport (BEST) COMSATCOM infrastructure. The BEST system has provided MSC with robust service connectivity for voice, data, and imagery, both secure and non-secure, for both classified and unclassified missions. More than 70 MSC vessels currently have their voice and data networks connected to the MSC Ashore Enterprise via BEST. MSC implemented the BEST solution as an overlay to its existing legacy International Maritime Satellite (Inmarsat) infrastructure. The BEST solution has achieved efficiencies on the order of 300 percent relative to the legacy Inmarsat architectures previously used by MSC. The annual recurring operating cost for MSC has remained virtually the same, while service throughput tripled and changed from periodic narrowband voice or data to full period wideband multimedia voice, data, Internet, and intranet (SIPRNET and NIPRNET).</p>
<p>The following events have necessitated the replacement of the BEST infrastructure:<br />&bull; The BEST Satellite Communications (SATCOM) services infrastructure is no longer able to satisfy expanding MSC mission requirements.<br />&bull; The current SATCOM terminals utilized by BEST (NERA Bm) are reaching end-of-life.<br />&bull; The supporting Inmarsat satellite constellation is nearing end-of-life.</p>
<p>As a follow-up to this RFI, DISA may host an Industry Days unclassified event, including one-on-one sessions between DoD and industry representatives, allowing for a more engaging exchange with the satellite industry. Attendance may be limited to businesses which respond to this RFI. Additional information regarding the conference agenda would be released in advance of Industry Days.</p>
<p>Market Research:</p>
<p>The following questions are intended to help structure a potential future COMSATCOM services acquisition that effectively leverages the commercial marketplace, delivering COMSATCOM services in concert with industry best practices to meet unique MSC goals and objectives. The preliminary Statement of Objectives (SOO) (Attachment A) provides insight into the planned Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) for a potential acquisition. Questions pertain to the full range of COMSATCOM services, as applicable, including fixed and mobile satellite services, managed services, as well as any potential future service offerings. We welcome additional insights beyond the specific questions in this RFI that vendors may be able to offer to help shape our potential acquisition.</p>
<p>1. Given the information contained in the SOO, what would you recommend to meet MSC's objectives? For example, but not limited to: <br />a. Where have we offered too few constraints and why? What else is needed?<br />b. Where have we offered too many constraints and why? What should be deleted?<br />c. Would any specific type of solution provide particular advantages to MSC based on this SOO? Please briefly define this solution and type and rationale or advantages.<br />d. What future technological improvements/enhancements may become available to MSC?</p>
<p>2. Are there any requirements within the SOO that are technically challenging? If yes, please explain further and suggest alternative strategies that could mitigate the implications of these technical challenges.</p>
<p>3. Does the way the SOO is worded or the vastness of the coverage requirements pose particular challenges? Are there any particular aspects that unduly drive cost? How could a slightly modified requirement offer potential for significant cost savings?</p>
<p>4. Is any aspect of the equipment and installation requirements particularly difficult or expensive? Please elaborate.</p>
<p>5. To understand the capability of available maritime COMSATCOM equipment to support our performance requirements, please provide any information that conveys the size and performance for antennas and terminals in a shipboard environment. Ship movement and satellite handover are of particular interest.</p>
<p>6. How would you recommend that we support a potential surge in bandwidth requirements in a certain area of the world? (For example, a sudden shift of many ships to a particular location.) How could costs be optimized for this type of requirement expansion?</p>
<p>7. Given MSC's varying mission locations, portability of services between regions may be required. MSC is interested to learn more about commercial best practices regarding portability of services.<br />a. How does industry define portability of COMSATCOM services?<br />b. How does industry approach the delivery of portability to MSC? What is required for industry to "guarantee" portability of services? What terms and conditions are associated with portability?<br />c. What types of costs are there and under what circumstances may they be incurred? How could these costs be minimized?<br />d. What new systems architectures could make portability of services easier to execute and utilize, and/or more cost effective (e.g., network managed service)?<br />e. Are there any innovative approaches or capabilities within industry that MSC should be aware of? How would these approaches or capabilities impact MSC's acquisition of COMSATCOM services?</p>
<p>8. MSC requires COMSATCOM shipboard installation and support services to be performed anywhere in the world. Explain how your company provides worldwide installation and support services.</p>
<p>9. MSC desires end-to-end situational awareness into its satellite and terrestrial communications systems to evaluate the impact of performance degradation and outages to ongoing and planned missions. Therefore, MSC would like to leverage commercially available operational information to the maximum extent possible. MSC requests information to help examine how to best access commercially available information providing end-to-end situational awareness of provisioned services:<br />o Spectral monitoring of all MSC leased bandwidth and provisioned services;<br />o Service performance data (e.g., EIRP, BER, Eb/No, C/kT); and<br />o Configuration changes in equipment used to support MSC leased COMSATCOM services.<br />MSC wishes to leverage industry best practices for management, monitoring, and control resources to the maximum extent possible to provide situational awareness of end-to-end provisioned services such as notification of planned and unplanned outages, interference events, intrusion detection events, and component degradation.<br />a. Are there any aspects of monitoring and control which would incur or could be added with extra costs?<br />b. Please provide technical details and articulate what information with what frequency and delay can be made available to a customer.<br />c. Please provide your strategy for interference monitoring and detection (interference to and by MSC users).<br />d. What situational awareness information is normally collected within industry as part of day-to-day operations? Are there any open/industry standards defining how this data is collected and managed?<br />e. To what extent does the situational awareness information referenced in Question 1 already exist and to what extent is it available to be provided to MSC? How close to real time could the information be made available?<br />f. How consistent is your company's ability to support this need across the globe? If inconsistent, what is the basis and how might this be resolved?<br />g. What type of trouble tracking capability and information is currently in use and can industry provide to MSC? What is considered a reportable service outage?<br />h. What construct for Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with respect to situational awareness are typical within the commercial industry? What experience does your company have with commitments on service availability, anomaly resolution, etc.?<br />i. What situational awareness data would your company be unwilling to share with the Government?<br />j. How does your company share planned outages and unplanned outages and what are the typical response times?</p>
<p>10. Given the fundamental importance of commercial satellite communications services to the warfighters, secure and uninterrupted service and timely anomaly resolution is a critical service requirement. MSC must carefully consider the most effective way to attain cost-effective mission supporting services while meeting unique DoD requirements. <br />a. How is your company positioned to support DoD security requirements, specifically:<br />o Personnel with U.S. Secret or NATO Secret Clearances;<br />o Secure facilities with an approved Facilities Security Clearance;<br />o Secure communications (e.g., STU/STE);<br />o Electromagnetic Interference/Radio Frequency Interference incident resolution; and<br />o Certification/accreditation of information systems in accordance with DoD policies and procedures, e.g., NIST, FISMA, DIACAP, etc.<br />b. Do you foresee any change in the future?<br />c. How consistent is your company's ability to support this need across the globe? If inconsistent, what is the basis and how might this be resolved?<br />d. If foreign owned, what steps have you taken (or do you plan to take), to best meet DoD security needs?<br />e. What lessons learned from past experience in providing services to DoD customers can be leveraged to better facilitate the delivery of robust COMSATCOM services?</p>
<p>11. The SOO currently requires global homogenous capacity based on Kpbs. We also may require incremental capacity either globally or regionally during parts of the period of performance. We would like to understand how this deviates from the way that industry typically would sell bandwidth to a geographically diverse customer. In addition:<br />a. Would you recommend an alternative or more defined breakout of bandwidth requirements?<br />b. Considering that a user typically can get more Kbps per KHz near the center of a satellite beam, and considering that our requirement includes homogenous Kbps threshold and objective levels, what are the implications and what alternative may better align with industry practices?<br />c. How might prices best be broken out (i.e., CLINs) and proposed for us to most effectively assess costs for our baseline and any future bandwidth requirements?<br />d. How might we best leverage scale economies, both for our baseline as well as any future bandwidth purchases?</p>
<p>12. To provide us a vector against our estimates and program funding, please provide rough estimates for costs against the high level comprehensive list of cost elements below:<br />Cost Element Annual Recurring Costs Total Non Recurring Costs<br />Satellite Bandwidth % % <br />Terrestrial % % <br />Equipment % % <br />Installation % % <br />Integration % % <br />Lifecycle Support % %<br />Total 5 year ROM $ $</p>
<p>a. Which requirements or aspects in the SOO drive costs? Why?<br />b. Which requirements or aspects in the SOO could be modified to reduce costs?<br />c. Please discuss possible modifications and potential impacts on costs.<br />d. Which requirements or aspects in the SOO have an opportunity to be modified to reduce costs/optimize value?</p>
<p>13. What is a rough estimate for the time from award of contract to Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for the first ship? What are the primary drivers of this timeframe? Which requirements or aspects in the SOO drive schedule? How can these be streamlined from an MSC perspective? Is the proposed equipment deployment/installation schedule in 5.5.3 attainable?</p>
<p>14. MSC may require offerors, deemed to be in the competitive range, to undergo Prototype Testing. The primary purpose of the testing is to validate the performance and assess the usability of the systems proposed by the leading RFP offerors. The test results would be utilized in the down-select process to determine which offeror would receive awards to implement production pilots. We want to minimize cost and schedule impacts. The NGW RFP Prototype Testbed consists of three network infrastructures representing two ships and one NOC within the STF laboratory facility in Chesapeake, VA. The two "ship" network infrastructures will be connected to two complete ship sets of offeror-owned satellite equipment (including VoIP gateways). The "NOC" network will interconnect with the two "ship" network infrastructures via a backhaul link to the offeror-designated Land Earth Station (LES). Each offeror selected for prototype testing would provide, at their expense, the following resources in support of the testing effort:<br />a. Satellite infrastructure (as specified in the applicable proposal) to equip two ships;<br />b. Terrestrial infrastructure (as specified in the applicable proposal) to equip one NOC;<br />c. LES resources to support the two ships and one NOC (including the backhaul link from the LES to Chesapeake, VA);<br />d. Personnel to install, operate, and support the satellite infrastructure;<br />e. Personnel to provide appropriate instruction in use of the solution;<br />f. Applicable satellite infrastructure documentation; and<br />g. Offerors will be given at least seven days notice prior to the testing initiation. Following offeror equipment installation and operation verification, testing duration will be no more than three 8-hour periods over 3 consecutive days.<br />Do you foresee any problems with this requirement? What timeline would you expect to be necessary? How might this influence industry responses and willingness to participate?</p>
<p>15. Can you offer any other insights or recommendations not articulated in this RFI that may help shape this potential acquisition? What are the benefits to MSC for your recommendations?</p>
<p>Additional Requested Information:<br />1. Request your response describe your company's demonstrated ability to perform the work detailed in the above background section and in the following specific areas:<br />a. Leasing FSS C-, X-, Ku-, and/or Ka-band bandwidth and/or procuring MSS airtime on a worldwide basis on behalf of an enterprise consumer from multiple global and regional providers. Please include the amount of bandwidth leased and how this experience can be applied to the scale necessary to support MSC.<br />b. Determining feasibility (e.g., link budget analysis) and leasing technical solutions in response to high-level communications requirements including obtaining licenses and host nation agreements/landing rights to activate the leased service. Include metrics (shortest, average, and longest) on the companies' observed ability to obtain host nation agreements/landing rights.<br />c. Implementing strategies that optimize performance or minimize enterprise lease costs (e.g., combining multiple service requests across services/geographic areas to achieve economic order quantities) in an ongoing or long-term basis.<br />d. Providing worldwide quick reaction service (i.e., several hours) on behalf of an enterprise consumer including measured response times, if available.<br />e. Supporting requests to add/modify the bandwidth provided in separate regions as needed.<br />f. Integrating multiple sources of RF spectrum and link and terminal status information into an enterprise-level situational awareness picture. Monitoring and reporting performance and providing rapid customer response to outages/degradations including measured response times, if available.<br />g. Installing maritime satellite communications hardware anywhere in the world.<br />h. Providing lifecycle support to a maritime customer fleet anywhere in the world.<br />2.

The commercial services are being procured using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR 13.106-1. A purchase order will be issued for software updates, preventative maintenance, and on-site repair of the following list of U.S. Government owned laboratory equipment:</p>
<p>1. Nomenclature: EVO 200/8, Roma Arm, Posld<br />Equipment ID # 10310872 <br />2. Nomenclature: Sunrise Reader<br />Equipment ID # 10309848<br />3. Nomenclature: Columbus Washer<br />Equipment ID # 10309948</p>
<p>The period of performance will not exceed one calendar year. The place of performance is The CDC, NCID San Juan Laboratories, 1324 Calle Canada, San Juan, Puerto Rico 009203860. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered as it is believed that Tecan Inc. is the only vender capable of maintaining this patented laboratory equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. It is further believed that all software upgrades are the intellectual property of Tecan and can only be installed by an authorized Tecan representative.

DeVenCI is looking for companies who have potential solutions in the following areas:

1. Information Processing and Analysis
   a. Automated language translation
   b. Collaborative planning tools
   c. Systems and data interoperability
   d. Data and information fusion

DeVenCI is a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) activity that seeks to improve national security in the Global War on Terrorism. Its dual goals are to speed DoD adoption of promising new commercial technologies and to encourage broader commercial support of the DoD supply chain. DeVenCI will use workshops, technical expositions, industry outreach, and a publically available web portal to increase the visibility of DoD needs to commercial companies and technology area experts. It will also provide timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and pilot opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses, but rather focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed adoption of emerging technology solutions to DoD user needs.

Companies interested in applying for participation in this workshop should contact DeVenCI via e-mail at devenci@osd.mil for an application. All applications must be received on or before February 18, 2009. Selected companies will be responsible for their travel and all other expenses associated with participation in this workshop which will be held in the mid April to early May timeframe.

YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUTE DAILY TO THE PERSONNEL SECURITY BRANCH OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, DC

Description

OPM has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on prospective ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.  The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.  ATF will provide these regulations to the Contractor.

ATF realizes there is a need to secure the services of persons possessing certain degrees of expertise in the processing of background investigations, including planning, scoping, assigning and reviewing.  To that end, ATF has a need for In-House Special Investigators, hereinafter referred to as contractors.  ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators.  Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations.  Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.

Contract investigators who are under contract with ATF shall be known as Special Investigators and carry credentials authorizing them to perform such background investigations as the Assistant Director may authorize.  Contractors may also be assigned to assist with other official ATF investigations.

Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them.  Such tasks might include planning assignments, scoping investigations, assigning investigations, reviewing Reports of Investigation (ROI), auditing and adjudicating investigations, completing invoices for payment for the investigation and working on special projects as directed by the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) and/or Branch Chief.  Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.

Contractors duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability.  Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Contractors will be paid at the rate of $54.50 per hour. Hours authorized and worked in excess of 40 hours per week will be paid at the rate of $81.75; the need for additional work hours must be agreed upon and have prior approval from the COTR and/or Branch Chief.  Contractors shall ensure their availability to process needed work in a timely manner.  A minimum of 32 hours per week is required.  Contractors are responsible for providing adequate office coverage with their respective team; to include holiday and high vacation/travel months.  Failure to meet necessary availability may result in termination of the contract. 

In compliance with ATFs specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractors invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work. 

ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.  Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.  

Contractors are responsible for safeguarding information.  Background investigation information is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 and, unless classified, is considered Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) (also or formerly known as Sensitive but Unclassified information). CUI must not be transmitted via unsecured email or Internet, or disclosed to unauthorized parties.  Contractors must never furnish or divulge CUI contained in an investigation.  Each contractor must make every reasonable effort to protect data associated with a background investigation.  Data, notes, copies of testimonies, copies of ROIs, etc., are the sole property of ATF and must be safeguarded against unlawful disclosure.  

Each contractor shall execute a MOU, attesting to his or her understanding of this section, which, upon execution, will become a permanent part of this contract.  Contractors will have access to ATFs computer network and are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year.  Contractors must also complete the following forms: ATF P 7500.1 (Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users), ATF F 2030.1 (Personnel Authenticator Locator), ATF F 1710.5 (Request for Media ID), and Social Engineering Certification.  

Identification media, ATF-provided software, and all other Government property must be surrendered when requested by the PSB. 

Each contractor must be able to obtain and maintain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and receive a Top Secret clearance.  This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the PSB, and be performed under such standards as the PSB may establish.  A favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF information, information technology systems, and unescorted access to facilities.  Failure to have a background investigation favorably adjudicated SSBI or receive a Top Secret clearance constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor.  ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.

Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  

Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. The contractor is responsible for making changes to his/her own information.  Any changes to the contractors name, address, telephone number, company name, tax identification number, or financial institution information must be made by the contractor in the CCR.  The CCR is used to process electronic payment deposits.  It is vital contractors keep their registration current.  In addition, contractors must notify the PSB and the ATF Financial Management Division of any changes so the proper updates can be made to all systems.  

Each contractor, when working in the PSB, must carry themselves in a manner that reflects positively on ATF.  To that end, contractors, when on duty, should present themselves in a professional manner, be neatly groomed, and appropriately attired.  Complaints of inappropriate conduct or performance will be investigated, and if substantiated, may result in the contract being terminated.

Contractors must exhibit professional qualities during all periods of performance and absolute integrity is required and expected.  Contractors must be polite and professional in both conduct and appearance.

Contractors should never use ATF credentials for investigating any matter not assigned to them by ATF, PSB or for any personal gain.  Contractors must not allow their credentials to be photocopied or taken from their possession.  Lost or stolen credentials should be reported to the PSB immediately, as well as the local police department.

ATF intends to issue vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2010.  The solicitation will close October 8, 2008 at 4 p.m. EST.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors.  A BPA will be awarded after all evaluations are passed, tentative selections are made, interviews completed and background investigations adjudicated favorably.  Because ATFs needs are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation add new contractors to the pool.  

Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminate the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendors acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate).  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply.  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as passed will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of at least 68 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores.  At least 56 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance and 12 must come from Vendor Capabilities.

A. Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance (80 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each vendors experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the vendors communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the vendors customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendors performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases.  Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.
(56 points minimum).

B. Capabilities (20 Points):  Capabilities are the vendors ability to adhere to agency and program requirements. (12 points minimum).

C. Acceptability: ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a pass or fail basis.  A vendors offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendors assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

Reference the following links for additional information:<br />Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch in 5 CFR Part 2635: <br />2002 CFR Title 5, Volume 3<br />Conflict of Interest laws in Chapter 11 of Title 18 of the United States Code: <br />Title 18 United States Code<br />Financial Disclosure requirements in 5 CFR Part 2634: http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_05/5cfr2634_05.html<br />The Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution (See Sec. 9, Clause 8): http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html <br />3 FAM 4120 (Employee Responsibilities Abroad): <br />http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/85177.pdf<br />e. Clearances <br />(a) Medical<br />1) U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are eligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense if the following conditions are met:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC's contract stipulates that s/he is eligible for MED services and requires the individual to have health insurance coverage overseas.<br />-- The employing agency is paying for medical services under the International Cooperative Support Services (ICASS) and guarantees funding for the direct charge of local hospitalization and medical evacuation.<br />2) Non-U.S. citizens: PSCs and their dependents are ineligible for Health Unit services and medical evacuation coverage (Medevac) at Government expense. However, CDC policy mandates that the PSC must meet the following conditions:<br />-- The PSC must have a current Medical clearance or waiver.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain health benefits coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service.<br />-- The PSC must have and maintain medical evacuation (medevac) coverage for self and any accompanying family members that is valid in the country of service. The Government will reimburse the cost of medevac insurance premiums. See C.3.i. Insurance (3) Medevac Insurance (b).<br />3) For all assignments outside of the United States, the contractor and any authorized dependents shall be required to be examined by one or more licensed doctors of medicine acceptable to CDC, and the contractor shall forward a summary of the results of the medical exams as well as copies of the original tests and laboratory reviews to the CDC's Office of Health and Safety (OHS) for adjudication as to whether the requirements of the position and assignment are met. For non-U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS makes these determinations internally but for U.S. citizen PSCs, OHS passes their recommendations on to Department of State's Office of Medical Services (State/MED) for a final determination. The OHS or State/MED decision is furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to the official award of a contract. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for all costs associated with obtaining the aforementioned medical clearance examinations. Note: The official award of a contract is dependent upon the successful completion of the medical clearance. If the medical clearance is not granted and a waiver is not obtained, the contractor may be ineligible for award.<br />(b) Suitability Background Check<br />Based on the required Suitability Background Check, contractor shall have no access to classified or administratively controlled materials. However, failure to obtain the Suitability Background Check required for full performance of all duties described in the position description may deem the offeror ineligible for award or, if already awarded, constitute cause for contract termination.<br />(c) Applies to only U.S. citizens: Security clearance is not required at this time, however, should such clearance become required during the period of performance of the contract, contractor shall be required to obtain security clearance prior to having access to classified information.<br />f. Work Week and Compensation<br />The contractor's workweek shall not be less than 40 hours, unless otherwise provided in the Contract Schedule, and shall coincide with the workweek for those employed by the Mission or the host country agency most closely associated with the work of this contract. If the contract is for less than full time (40 hours weekly), the annual and sick leave earned shall be prorated (see the general provision of this contract entitled Leave and Holidays).<br />The contractor's compensation shall not be adjusted to reflect the pay comparability adjustments, which are granted from time to time to U.S. direct-hire employees by Executive Order for the statutory pay systems.<br />g. Leave and Holidays<br />1) Annual Leave:<br />(i) The rate of earned annual leave is determined on a case-by-case basis by the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH). In making this determination, COGH considers the individual's previous relevant service to the US Government through any of various employment, contractual, or grantee arrangements. However, no annual leave credit shall be earned if the tour of duty is less than 90 calendar days. Former Civil Service and CDC personal contractual service is creditable towards PSC service for annual leave accumulation purposes. Leave is earned at the following accumulation rates per pay period, based on relevant service credited by COGH:<br />0 to 3 years: 6 hrs.<br />Over 3 years: 8 hrs.<br />(These rates are based on a combination of annual leave and home leave granted to members of the Foreign Service.)<br />(ii) It is understood that annual leave is provided under this contract primarily for the purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation during the tour of duty in the host country and may be used only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer. The Contractor in consultation with the CDC Field Supervisor shall develop a leave schedule early in his/her tour of duty taking into consideration project requirements, employee preference and other factors. Unused annual leave will be reimbursed at the end of the period of performance of the resultant contract provided such leave does not exceed the annual carryover limit, currently 360 hours, plus the number of hours earned and unused during the final pay year during performance under this contract.<br />(iii) With the approval of the CDC Field Supervisor, and if the circumstances warrant, a contractor may be authorized advance annual leave in excess of leave earned, but in no case shall a contractor be authorized advance annual leave in excess of that which he/she will earn over the life of the contract. The contractor agrees to reimburse CDC for leave used in excess of the amount earned during the contractor's assignment under the contract.<br />2) Sick Leave: Sick leave is earned at a rate not to exceed 13 workdays per annum or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Unused sick leave may be carried over under an extension of this contract, but the contractor will not be compensated for unused sick leave at the completion of this contract. Sick leave may be carried over from one post to another whether or not a break in service occurs.<br />3) Relief Travel<br />The contractor shall be entitled to the reimbursement of air travel to return to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's original recruitment - to be determined by the Government at contract award. Relief travel refers to the reimbursement of air travel only and is earned for service outside the continental United States that allows the contractor to return to the city of last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment, or to any other place the contractor chooses, but reimbursable only up to the cost of round-trip tickets for the contractor and legal dependents at post to the city of recruitment or the last legal residence at the time of the contractor's recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the contractor wants to go elsewhere, the costs reimbursed will be limited to those costs equal to the contractor's last residence at time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. The contractor shall be responsible for all additional costs above those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award. If the costs are less than those costs that would be required for a return trip to the last legal residence at the time of original recruitment - as determined by the Government at contract award, then the reimbursable costs would be limited to the total cost of the trip. The contractor and dependents shall be eligible for relief travel when the following conditions are met:<br />i. The period of performance of awarded contract is for a minimum of 12 months. <br />ii. One relief travel reimbursement shall be granted per 12-month contract period served at place of performance as designated in the contract.<br />iii. Contractor must have served a minimum of 4 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract at commencement of Relief Travel.<br />iv. Contractor must serve a minimum of 3 consecutive months at place of performance as designated in the contract upon return from Relief Travel, or the cost of the Relief Travel will be deducted from the contractor's final payment, and any costs not recovered by deduction will be reimburseable to the Government.<br />v. The contractor must be approved in advance in writing for use of sufficient annual leave, leave without pay, or a combination thereof, for Relief Travel.<br />Exceptions to the above conditions shall be coordinated with COGH. Exceptions shall be based on extenuating circumstances only. If the period of performance of resultant contract exceeds 12 months or an option is exercised, and the contractor qualifies for relief travel, each relief travel reimbursement shall be used a minimum of 6 months apart. The contractor shall be reimbursed for any cancellation cost that is incurred which is caused by the Government.<br />4) Emergency Travel<br />Emergency transportation costs will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. To be eligible for reimbursement of transportation costs under emergency conditions, one of the following circumstances must exist:<br />(i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to which the employee is assigned or serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. CDC Field Supervisor or Government Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at contractor expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is necessary.<br />(ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the immediate family of the employee as determined by COGH or the immediate family of the employee's spouse.<br />When, for any reason, the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO determines it is necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the contractor will be reimbursed IAW paragraph 3 Relief Travel above. The return of such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so, and based on medical opinion, contractor is fit to return to duty.<br />.<br />The CDC Field Supervisor or Government PCO may also authorize the reimbursement of emergency transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, the circumstances warrant such action. Such authorization shall include the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.<br />5) Holidays <br />The contractor, while serving abroad, shall be entitled to all USG holidays and may also be excused from duty on local holidays and other occasions when the U.S. embassy is closed. However, there will be no additional compensation should the PSC be required to work on a local holiday that is not also a U.S. holiday.<br />6) Leave Without Pay <br />Leave without pay may be granted only with the written approval of the CDC Field Supervisor or Contracting Officer.<br />7) Compensatory Time and Overtime<br />The accrual and use of Compensatory (Comp) Time may be approved in lieu of overtime pay for irregular or occasional overtime work. A PSC employee whose contract does not provide for overtime pay may be awarded Comp Time for overtime hours worked. One hour of Comp Time off is granted for each hour of overtime work. The accrual and use of Comp Time is subject to written supervisory approval, as with Annual Leave. All Comp Time hours must be recorded on the Time and Attendance Report as they are earned and used.<br />A PSC employee will lose entitlement to Comp Time earned if it is not used by the end of eight pay periods immediately after having been earned (16 weeks beginning the first pay period after the pay period in which the Comp Time was earned), unless the failure was due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control.<br />Overtime and Sunday Differential are not authorized under this contract. Should overtime be required during the performance of this contract, the Field Supervisor shall submit a request for contract modification.<br />8) Passport<br />All passports must be valid for the entire period of performance of the contract. In the event that a passport expires during the period of performance of resulting contract, a copy of the renewed passport shall be submitted to the PCO.<br />h. Social Security, Federal Income Tax and Foreign Earned Income - Applies to only U.S. Citizens and Permanent Resident Aliens of the U.S. subject to U.S. Federal Income and FICA laws.<br />1) As a Personal Service Contract employee, when applicable, F.I.C.A. contributions and U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted from salary payments in accordance with regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively.<br />2) As a Personal Service Contract employee, the contractor is not eligible for the "foreign earned income" exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).<br />i. Insurance<br />1) Worker's Compensation Benefits<br />The contractor shall be provided worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.<br />2) Health and Life Insurance.<br />a) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 75% against the actual costs of the contractor's annual health insurance costs, excluding costs for private medical evacuation (medevac) insurance, if any, provided that such costs may not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.<br />b) The contractor shall be provided a maximum contribution of up to 33 1/3% against the actual costs of annual basic life insurance coverage on the same basis as the U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire personnel under the Federal Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) Program. Basic life insurance coverage is defined as coverage up to an amount equal to the contractor's annual basic salary rounded up to the next even $1,000 plus $2,000.<br />c) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not provide coverage or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such cases, the contractor could be eligible for contributions under paragraphs i.2(a) and/or (b) of this provision.<br />d) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance shall be prorated and paid accordingly.<br />e) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their spouse's Government health and/or life insurance policy is ineligible for the contribution under i. Insurance 1) and/or 2), respectively, of this provision.<br />3) Medevac Coverage<br />a) U.S. Citizens: U.S. citizens who meet the medical clearance requirements are furnished medical evacuation service at no cost.<br />b) Non U.S. citizens do not qualify for government furnished medical evacuation service at no cost and thus will be responsible for obtaining required medical evacuation (medevac) insurance. CDC shall reimburse 100% of the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance maintained by the contractor. CDC does not require that contractor obtain coverage from any one specific company. The contractor is responsible for and has the discretion to choose a provider. For information purposes only: The Department of State maintains a list of U.S. based providers on the following website: <br />http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/brochures/brochures_1215.html<br />CDC provides no endorsement, expressly or implied, of any emergency medical service provider. Contractors have full discretion to consider providers not provided in this list, but are expected to verify that the coverage they do obtain will adequately cover an evacuation due to a medical situation that arises in the location of contract performance. CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract. After receipt of an offer letter, the contractor shall furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance and its cost, for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders, in order for CDC to reimburse the fair and reasonable cost of medevac insurance.<br />j.

<DESC>Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD) of the Federal Highway Administration anticipates awarding up to three Full-Service Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for architect-engineer (A-E) services.  Projects will primarily involve improvements to low-volume and low-speed roadways ranging from 3R (resurfacing, restoration and rehabilitation) to full reconstruction.  Transportation engineering services will include all pertinent highway work needed to conduct planning, scoping, preliminary and final design to prepare contract documents in support of several federally funded programs administered by CFLHD.

TYPE OF CONTRACT:  This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis to A-E firms licensed and registered within one or more of the states served by CFLHD.  Professional documents produced under each contract will require a Professional Engineer and/or a Registered Land Surveyor license relative to the state in which the project work is located.  Each contract awarded will consist of 1 base year and options to extend the contract for 4 additional 1-year periods.  Each successful A-E firm will be re-evaluated each year to determine award of options to extend the contract.  The guaranteed contract minimum shall not be less than $25,000, with a maximum not-to-exceed 5-year total of $10 million.  Each contract will operate with individually negotiated task orders issued in accordance with the terms of the contract.  Task orders may or may not be for a complete project or series of projects.  

Selected firms must comply with Equal Employment Opportunity requirements in accordance with FAR 22.8.  Subcontracting plans will be required by the selected firms for large businesses in accordance with FAR 19.7.

<CONTACT>Elizabeth A. Jackson, (757) 878-2100

<a href="mailto:elizabeth.a.jackson@us.army.mil">Aviation Applied Technology Directorate</a>
<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) anticipates award for a noncommercial program entitled VUIT-2 VORTEX in support of the Kiowa VUIT-2 for the OH-58D Helicopter.  The objectives of this program are to procure engineering support services, and hardware including, but not limited to VORTEX radios associated hardware, in support of demonstration and potential fielding of the capability on Army and other DoD aircraft to both transmit and receive video and data from current U.S. Army UAS and VUIT-2 equipped AH-64D Apaches in the Ku, C, S, and L frequency bands, and to transmit video and data to OSRVT systems and VUIT-2 equipped AH-64D Apaches.  The ability to transmit and receive OSRVT compatible video and data from all of the listed sources on all of these frequencies in one component is a vital distinction differentiating the VORTEX radio from other available products.  A flight test will be performed of the Kiowa VUIT-2 system providing level 2 control.  The system must provide the capability to receive video and data from all U.S. Army UAS and VUIT-2 equipped AH-64D apaches as well as transmit the OH-58D Mast Mounted Sight (MMS) sensor video to the OSRVT operators and VUIT-2 equipped AH-64Ds.  The Kiowa VUIT-2 system will display both received video and position data on the aircraft Lightweight Color Multi-Function Displays (LWCMFD).  As well as viewing this data the pilot/copilot must be able to control all of the systems functionality while the aircraft is in flight.  Due to size and space limitations of the aircraft, the system must occupy a minimal size and weight footprint.  The Kiowa VUIT-2 system must be compatible with OSRVT software to ensure commonality with all U.S. Army UAS, VUIT-2 Apaches, and OSRVTs.  The contract will support potential projects to demonstrate and provide the capability to other Army or DoD aircraft.  A sole source award per 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements of VUIT-2 VORTEX.  AATD anticipates award of an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a contract maximum $9, 950,000.  Orders will be issued on a firm fixed price (FFP) and cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) basis.  The sole source IDIQ award to L3 Communications Corporation, Salt Lake City, Utah has a contract minimum of $500,000 that will be met with the first task order.  L3 Communications is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely capable of meeting this requirement without a substantial duplication of cost and schedule.  The development of these systems to provide the same functionality within a single component would require duplication of cost and take significant additional time and delay implementation of this critical capability that reduces operational risk to aircraft and Soldiers. This acquisition will be conducted pursuant to the terms of FAR Parts 6 and 15.  Market research has identified L3 Communications as the only manufacturer with knowledge, experience and as the original designer and manufacturer of the VORTEX system.  L3 Communications has sole access to the technical specification, the design an intellectual property to the VORTEX system equipment.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to L3 Communications.  The contract terms and conditions will be developed jointly between the Government and L3 Communications consistent with alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the FAR.  The ordering period for this IDIQ is sixty (60) months.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334290.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that shall be considered.  Written proposals should be submitted no later than March 19, 2009 at 2:00 p.m. EST to AATD, ATTN:  Beth Jackson AMSRD-AMR-AA-C, Bldg. 401 Lee Blvd., Fort Eustis, Virginia 23604-5577.  Ms. Jacksons phone number is 757-878-2100.  Anyone desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing at the above address, fax 757-878-0008 or Email elizabeth.a.jackson@us.army.mil.  Contracting Officer is Lauren Sebring who can be reached at 757-878-4828 or lauren.sebring@us.army.mil

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), within the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the offices programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC><p>Items 1-4 are questions asked at the walk through. As a result of these questions, the customer revised the Statement of Work which would answer these questions/clarify the work being performed. The updated Statement of Work being mentioned is currently posted for this requirement. Please call or e-mail Christina Rojas if you have questions.
<p>1. Should the wiring be removed from the floor conduits, or should the floor conduits with wire inside be removed?</p>
<p>2. Are Pull ropes only for conduits back to the power room and not for the conduits in the floor from the PDUs?</p>
<p>3. Should conduits be removed from the walls to just above the ceiling? What about the conduits on the wall going under the floor?</p>
<p>4. Electrical drawings would be available upon request.</p>
<p>Question asked after walk through:</p>
<p>Question: Are there valves in the 4" lines that supply each individual PAC and those lines are to be terminated just back to those valves, not all the way back the 8" main?</p>
<p>Answer: The Drawings show actually 3" lines, but they could be 4 " lines. The basic answer is not all the way back to the main. The contractor will have to do a site walk down for verification. Here is the updated statement of work.</p>

<DESC>Need 10 tons of fertilizer total (that's 20,000 pounds).  However----

-it must first be packaged in bags so that the field crew can carry (so that means each bag must be no more than 50-55 pounds - or it could be less than 50).  And then---

-second, the bags must be packaged so that a helicopter can carry them to the field in loads (that means about 1375 pounds a load - and so should have about 15 loads).  Also---

-each load needs to be in bulk bags certified for air lift.  And---

-each loaded bulk bag needs to be banded on pallets, so that we can move them around with fork-lift's in the process of getting off barge and to the helicopter staging area, and so that the bands can be cut so the loaded cargo bags can be freed from the pallets before the helicopter picks them up.

Fertilizer must be water soluable.

Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items.

Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on Fedbid.  All bids will be provided from GSA approved vendors.  It is anticipated the final award will be to the entity providing the best competitive price through the Fedbid process.  As this is a brand name justification it is supporting existing HP equipment that has reached end of life or out-of-cycle SAN that will be moved to the LAB which has no SAN.  Current SAN is 4 years old, is not expandable and has become stretched for capacity.<BR><BR>to correct Line Item 9<BR><BR>

Approximately 550 to 600 onsite parking spaces are available for tenant and client use.  GSA is interested in considering alternative space if relocation is economically advantageous to the Government.  In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space.  Proximity to employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation, and a fitness center, as well as hotel accommodations for visitors is also necessary.  Other factors impacting the Governments rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.  

Space must be located in Lakewood, Colorado and within these boundaries:  North-Sixth Avenue; South-Jewell Avenue, East-Pierce Street; and West-Sixth Avenue to Indiana to Jewel.  Space must meet the Federal Governments standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged, and be located outside a 100-year floodplain.  The space must meet the Green requirements in the Solicitation become LEED Certified.  Space must be ready for occupancy on October 1, 2009 or sooner.  A lease term of 10 years with a firm term of 5 years is sought.  

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the buildings ownership.  If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM EDT, February 17, 2009.  Expressions of interest should include building name and address, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), ANSI/BOMA defined usable square feet, percentage of common area factor used to determine the rentable square feet, one-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered, and contact information for owner or authorized agent.

A written statement of interest should be submitted by February 17, 2009 to: Dan McPherson, c/o General Services Administration, Colorado Service Center (8PC), P. O.

<a href="mailto:umetria.thomas@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Research Triangle Park</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, RTP Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, is issuing the FINAL Program Announcement (PA), W911NF-08-R-0012, for the Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA).  The purpose of this United States Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA) Program Announcement (PA) is to solicit offers that will help fulfill the research and development goals of the U.S. Department of the Army.  The objective of the Alliance is to conduct research creating the technical foundation supporting development of future autonomous unmanned systems. To achieve this objective the Alliance will advance fundamental science and technology in several key areas including the ability of unmanned systems to sense and fully understand the local environment in terms of both features and activities; the ability to interact intelligently with the surroundings to successfully conduct meaningful activity; individually or as part of a team, to readily adapt to changing situations and to learn from prior experience; the ability to be integrated safely and successfully into human activity; the ability to dexterously manipulate objects in a human-like fashion and to maneuver unfettered in cluttered, complex environments.  The Army envisions the Alliance will bring together government, industrial, and academic institutions to address research and development required to enable the deployment of future military unmanned ground vehicle systems ranging in size from man-portables to ground combat vehicles.  The FINAL ROBOTICS CTA PA has been posted at www.grants.gov and the Robotics CTA website: www.arl.army.mil/robotics.  This PA will result in the award of two instruments:  (1) a cooperative agreement as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for the execution of the Fundamental Research Component; and (2) a procurement contract as defined in 31 U.S.C. 6303 for the execution of the Technology Transition Component that will be awarded to the Integration Lead Organization of the selected Consortium.  The cooperative agreement for the Fundamental Research Component will be awarded to a Consortium of academic and industrial organizations.  To assure the creation of a well focused research program, the consortium will be kept small, ideally with approximately six members.  The consortium will be led by an organization that will be charged with spearheading the technology integration and technology transition efforts. This organization will be designated as the Integration Lead Organization (ILO) and its CTA activities shall be conducted in the United States.  There will be no limitation to the place of performance for other organizations participating in the Consortium.  However Consortium activities, conducted under the Technology Transition Component of the Alliance and directly related to military applications may come under the jurisdiction of the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) and appropriate controls must be in place when foreign entities are part of the Consortium.  Additionally, the Consortium must include an HBCU/MI member(s) that will participate substantially in the research effort and receive at least 10% of the funding for the Fundamental Research Component.  The Consortium will function as a collective of equal partners deciding upon all Consortium matters equally. Since unmanned systems draw upon a broad palette of technologies, it is expected that the Consortium will be enhanced by a constantly changing group of additional researchers and research organizations chosen jointly by the Consortium and the Government to complement research already undertaken by the Consortium and Government.  These researchers and research topics, while part of the annual program plan, will be subawardees to one of the Consortium partners and not part of the Consortium proper.    The procurement contract will be awarded to the ILO for the Consortium. The ILO is expected to subcontract with other entities (both members of the Consortium and other organizations as appropriate) to achieve the technology transition efforts. Individual tasks will be issued under the procurement contract as transition opportunities are identified from the research results under the cooperative agreement.  The proposal will form the basis for the Initial Program Plan and will set the stage for subsequent annual program plans.  Therefore the technical proposal should be detailed, identifying proposed research activities to the task level, specific research goals and timelines for each proposed research task, and the proposed set of personnel that will conduct these activities together with their qualifications. It should identify proposed mechanisms for intra-consortium and intra-alliance collaboration.  It should specify proposed educational opportunities for Government researchers and mechanisms for further developing the research and educational programs of the HBCU/MI members.  Plan funding levels are set forth in the FINAL Robotics CTA PA.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the Robotics consortium for five years with an option for an additional five years.

<DESC>The U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, RTP Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, is issuing a FINAL Program Announcement (PA), W911NF-08-R-0014, for the Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CAN CTA).  The purpose of the United States Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CAN CTA) Program Announcement (PA) is to solicit offers to establish a new Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA) in the area of Cognition and Neuroergonomics.  The FINAL CAN CTA PA can be found at www.grants.gov and the CAN CTA website: http://www.arl.army.mil/cogn-neuroerg.   The Army envisions that the Alliance will bring together government, industrial and academic institutions to address research and development to enable optimal Soldier-system performance during tactical operations.  The objective of the Alliance is the development and demonstration of fundamental translational principles, that is, principles governing the application of neuroscience-based research and theory to complex operational settings. The Alliance is expected to perform enabling research and to transition technology to enhance Soldier-system performance in complex operational settings by optimizing information transfer between the system and the Soldier, identifying mental processes and individual differences that impact mission-relevant decision making, and developing technologies for individualized analyses of neurally-based processing in operational environments. To achieve this objective the Alliance is expected to implement computational modeling and to execute and link neuroscience-based research from multiple levels to produce advances in fundamental science and technology, demonstrate and transition technology, and develop research demonstrators for Warfighter experimentation.  This PA will result in the award of two instruments:  (1) a cooperative agreement as defined at 31 U.S.C. 6305 for the execution of the Fundamental Research Component; and (2) a procurement contract as defined in 31 U.S.C. 6303 for the execution of the Technology Transition Component.  The cooperative agreement for the Fundamental Research Component will be awarded to a Consortium consisting of a Lead of the Consortium and other Members as necessary and appropriate to fulfill the goals of the CAN CTA Program. At least 70% of Fundamental Research Component funds go to academic institutions and at least 10% of the total funding provided for academic institutions must be provided to HBCU/MI Member(s).  The Lead of the Consortium may be an academic or industrial concern.  The procurement contract will be awarded to the Lead of the Consortium.  Individual tasks will be issued under the procurement contract as transition opportunities are identified from the research results under the cooperative agreement.   Under this PA, proposals are sought to select the consortium for the CAN CTA.  Planned funding levels for the cooperative agreement are set forth in the CAN CTA PA.  Contingent upon available funding, the Army expects to support the Cognition and Neuroergonomics consortium for five years with an option for an additional five years.
