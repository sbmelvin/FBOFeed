<DESC>NA (1) The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC), U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) have identified strong common technical inter ests that can best be advanced through consolidated grants to colleges and universities having exceptional expertise in or understanding of one or more of the technical areas as they relate to the missions of these agencies.   Proposals submitted should in clude new ideas and advanced and innovative concepts for current and emerging principles.  The technology proposal categories are:     A.  Advanced Propulsion and Hypersonic Systems:   NASA's MSFC has the lead role for defining and developing future generation reusable launch vehicles as part of the Integrated Space Transportation Program (ISTP).  MSFC is currently prioritizing technologies for investments in making second, third and fou rth generation space vehicles safer, more reliable and less expensive.  In addition to earth-to-orbit and on-orbit propulsion, MSFC is also looking for in-space propulsion that may not contain solid or liquid propellants as we currently know them. SMDC is responsible for development of defense against missiles that may carry weapons of mass destruction.  Current ballistic missile defense interceptors use kinetic energy in the form of missile-to-missile body impact at supersonic velocities as the des truction mechanism.  Interceptors require a variety of hypersonic and propulsion technologies in a missile that must be extremely fast, agile, accurate and affordable. AMCOM has two very important mission areas in fixed/rotary wing aircraft and tactical missiles.  Both areas require special forms of propulsion and hypersonic technology and both are very important to the ongoing transformation of the Army.  Several of AMC OM's aviation and missile systems will be part of the transformation objective force.  Aviation platforms require advanced turbo-machinery propulsion for heavier lift, better reliability and lower life-cycle costs.  Tactical missiles such as the Common Mis sile and the Compact Kinetic Energy Missile may require smokeless insensitive propellants, smaller and lighter packaging envelopes, and in some cases, hypersonic velocities to achieve desired lethality. Potential research areas for Advanced Propulsion and Hypersonic Systems are: 		  1.  Advanced Materials and Innovative Structures 		  2.  Combustion Devices 		  3.  Turbomachinary 		  4.  High Speed Turbines 		  5.  Aerothedrmodynamics 	           6.  Jet Interactions 		  7.  Advanced Propellants 		  8.  Solid/Hybrid Propulsion 		  9.  Scramjets 	         10.  Electric Propulsion 	         11.  Propellantless Propulsion                   12.  Biosensors 		13.  Electromagnetic 	         14.  High Energy Systems 	         15.  Innovative Concepts and Systems     B.  Robotics: MSFC, as NASA's lead center for the ISTP will explore the possibilities of robotics for several applications to gain safer, higher reliability and lower cost access to space and on-orbit or space exploration operations.  Areas of interest will include auto mated extravehicular activities, autonomous maneuver control and space docking operation, advanced manufacturing techniques for exotic materials, and automated on-orbit satellite replenishment and servicing systems. SMDC, as the lead organization for the Army's role in space and missile defense will share some of the applications of robotics with NASA in that on-orbit satellite rendezvous, maneuvering, docking and servicing will be required for future space assets.  A lso, future missile defense will need lower cost logistical footprints and maintenance costs, part of which may be addressed by use of robotics handlers, loaders launchers and diagnostic devices.  Another area of interest will be the application of some ro botics-related technologies for next generat ion low-cost miniature ballistic missile and cruise missile interceptors. AMCOM will have an interest in future Army robotics capabilities.  These include a host of leap-ahead technologies in autonomous/cooperative decision making for  and threat target recognition, autonomous secure perimeter surveillance and reporting and rout ine maintenance and ability to accomplish routine inspection tasks like missile handlers, loaders and launcher resupply will also be of interest to reduce battlefield logistics timelines and costs. The potential areas of robotics research include:  		 1.  Autonomous Decision Making 		 2.  Perception 		 3.  Man-Robot Interfaces 		 4.  World Modeling and Representation 		 5.  Cooperative Behaviors 		 6.  Visual Signal Processing 		 7.  Scene Understanding / Pattern Recognition 		 8.  Innovative Communications 		 9.  Coupled Spacecraft Control 	         10. Innovative Sensor Schemes 	         11. Miniaturization of Robotics Parts 		12.  Miniature Inspection Robots 	         13. Other Applicable Systems Technologies     C.  Novel Power/Energy Sources: MSFC will be seeking novel power/energy sources to support third and fourth generation reusable  launch vehicles and novel ways of powering space exploration platforms and probes (e.g. the Pluto/Kuiper Belt Rendezvous mission).  Ultra-efficiency solar cells and thermal energy collectors will power onboard devices and perhaps augment in-space propulsio n systems.  There will also be a need for compact electromechanical/electrostatic/electromagnetic stores such as ultra-capacitors.   SMDC and AMCOM both have needs for novel on-board-missile power/energy sources.  Lighter, more efficient, lower cost devices and longer shelf life are key issues with all missiles.  Novel power sources may also power autonomous robots or unmanned aerial or  ground vehicles in the future battlefield. Future military space operations of SMDC may call for energy/power sources for applications similar in scope to those of NASA.  Miniaturized interceptors could likewise take advantage of technological advance in this area of research. Potential research areas for novel power/energy sources include: 		1.  Solar Energy 		2.  Storage/Conversion Concepts 		3.  Reactive Chemicals/Compounds 		4.  Harvesting Surplus Human Energy 		5.  Compact Electrochemical/Electrostatic/Electromagnetic Stores 		6.  Non-thermal Batteries/Thermal Batteries 	         7.  Cold Fusion     D.  Broad Spectrum Vision Sensors MSFC had long been a developer and user of multi-spectrum sensors for the great observatories like Chandra and the Hubble Space Telescope.  These sensors have been used for optical alignment and calibration as well as astronomical observations of the unive rse.  Broad spectrum visions sensors refers to the simultaneous real-time imaging of events or phenomena in multi-spectral regimes.  In addition to observations of the universe such sensors might be used in non-invasive or non-destructive evaluation of fli ght components for satellite docking and servicing, or for passively or actively imaging distant objects for purposes of tracking, classification and recognition. SMDC has many multi-spectral sensor applications ranging in complexity from exo-atmospheric discrimination of real ballistic missile reentry vehicles from penetration aids, to over-the-horizon cruise missile detection against a highly cluttered background.   Broad spectrum vision sensors which can image a target, might be used onboard a missile interceptor, or as part of an observation, acquisition, tracking and target discriminating sensor package platform that is ground-based, airborne, or space-based. AMCOM uses many forms of multi-spectral sensors in helicopter and fixed wing battlefield reconnaissance and surveillance systems, missile targeting using semi-active target designation, passive visible and imaging infrared sensors onboard missiles, and in automatic target recognition , classification and aimpoint selection.  Broad-spectrum imaging sensors could make maximum use of the radiation  phenomenology that is the most prevalent to obtain the highest contrast picture of potential targets for each of these applications, thus avoiding friendly targets while recognizing and classifying unfriendly targets. Potential areas for broad-spectrum vision sensors are:                     1. Lightweight, Compact IR and RF Seekers 	           2. Conformal Multispectral Seeker Radomes 	           3. Real-Time Processing of Hyperspectral Data 	           4. Object Recognition 	           5. Sensor Arpeture Sharing Techniques 	           6. Imaging Infrared (I2R) Sensors 	           7. Multi-Spectral Computer-Aided Tomography 	           8. Automated Target Recognition (2)	Pursuant to 32 CFR Sec. 22.315 and Sec. 22.320, this announcement is open only to eligible U.S. colleges and universities.

This announcement constitutes the only solicita tion; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Any amendments will be issued through the FedBizOpps under solicitation number DAAE2002T0144.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitati on document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-01, effective 21 December 2001.  This solicitation is a full and open unrestricted, firm fixed price type procurement, NAICS Code  611420.  Th is requirement is for Windows 2000 Training to be taught to approximately 845 employees on-site at TACOM-RI located on the Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, Illinois.   The performance work statement follows:   1.  The contractor will conduct a structured curriculum of Windows 2000 – Level 1 training for the United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command-Rock Island (TACOM-RI) workforce.  Only vendors that have been providing this type of training for a  period of at least six months and are Microsoft Certified Trainers are eligible to respond with a quotation.  Due to the fact that our workforce presently uses  Windows 95 and has worked in this environment for some time now,  employees do not need signif icant training in the very basic computer skills.  The curriculum will cover at a minimum:   a.  Overview – Short comparison of Windows 95x to Windows 2000 noting differences.   b.  The Windows 2000 Environment:  Very brief Right/Left Mouse explanation and  usage. Logging on to your Workstation; the Windows 2000 Desktop; the taskbar and the start menu; working with an open window; and using help.  c.

<DESC>This announces the availability of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) which describes in general terms a research topic and outlines proposal preparation requirements.  The purpose is to solicit proposals for small pilot and feasibility clinical trials and to encourage the adequate testing of novel and innovative potential therapies for osteoporosis.  Projects supported would be phase I/phase II human trials to test basic safety and efficacy of treatments that would not be otherwise developed and pursued by private industry. The objectives of this initiative are to: 1) Identify and begin clinical testing of potential bone active agents; and 2) Perform initial dosing trials and select appropriate populations and endpoints for larger scale testing in appropriately powered clinical intervention trials.  To achieve the main goal of this BAA, the NIAMS seeks to support small pilot and feasibility trials.  The trials should be designed so that the preliminary data obtained would be sufficient to design the next phase (for example, Phase II/III), for which the investigators will have to seek separate funding or obtain evidence of efficacy where a large, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is not feasible.

It is anticipated that two to three cost reimbursement contract awards will be made for a period of three years beginning on or about September 30, 2002.  The solicitation NIH-NIAMS-BAA-02-05 will be available electronically on or about February 11, 2002 and may be accessed through the Internet at the following address:  http://www.nih.gov/niams/grants/rfp/rfplist.htm . Proposals will be due on or about May 1, 2002. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments and for routinely checking the Internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government.  All responsible sources may submit proposals which will be considered by the Government.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<SUBJECT>99--OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE IV&V FACILITY
<SOLNBR>RFP5-52423-501
<ARCHDATE>01292003
<CONTACT>Thomas  Russell, Contracting Officer, Phone (301)286-2885, Fax (301)286-0341, Email Thomas.S.Russell.1@gsfc.nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of the Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Facility owned by the West Virginia University Research Corporation (WVURC) and located in Fairmont, WV.  NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the services from the West Virginia University Research Corporation (WVURC). The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source. The IV&V facility was constructed by WVURC under a NASA grant, and title of the completed facility was transferred to WVURC.  The grant also stipulated that NASA would occupy the facility to perform IV&V services for the Agency. In support of this activity, NASA has funded WVURC for the operation and maintenance of the facility in support of the NASA activities conducted at the facility since the original occupation in October 1993. Therefore, this action will result in a follow-on contract to the current cooperative agreement with WVURC. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued provision of specialized services, such services may be deemed to be available from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition. Based on this, competition of the effort is not reasonable because of the substantial investment in the physical facility and the fact that WVURC has title to the facility and is the owner/operator.  Therefore, WVURC is determined to be the only responsible source capable of providing the O&M and other physical infrastructure necessary to support NASA operations. The anticipated period of performance of the resultant contract is 10 years. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. See note 22.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 13, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

These systems should run as an integrated set of multi-tier client/server solutions.  There will also be need for them to interface with existing internal and external systems.  All requirements are mandatory unless otherwise noted; however, the contractor is strongly encouraged to propose alternate approaches to addressing any requirement which would result in improved services and/or reduced costs.

Here are some questions that I have:
If the server is given to us pre-configured, what would be an example of the kind of Solaris, Linux, and Apache configuration that would be required.
Please give an example of the type of assistance that would be expected for CGI/Perl and Oracle.
Who will be configuring the backup system to run automatically, Atlantech or DLIELC?
Does DLIELC providing the security patches and updates mean that DLIELC will be installing them, or simply handing them to us to install?
What type of hardware support (repair) will be necessary and is there a SUN warranty/service contract for any hardware failures?
The 2 servers will be already programmed using Sun Solaris Unix OS, Apache Server (running the webserver), Oracle 8I (running the Store DB), Java (running the ServSide Style sheets), Perl (running the Shopping Chart input), CGI, and HTML files. The Load Balancer will have Linux with Apache.
DLIELC Webmaster will be updating files through TELNET sessions. He will be needing technician support/assistance on some of the program above. Backup requirement will be set by both DLIELC and ISP.
ISP will be required to go to Solaris and Apache website to uptain and run/install latest security patches. All the programs and equipment will be procure by DLIELC.

More information from the customer for your review:
This system is already in place and develop- It is set on two Sun Sparc 10 Systems that run Unix.
All the equipment and software is government owned and has been in use for the last 3 years. We are not asking to change the configuration just technical expertise on both software and hardware.
The system is already configured. It is a dedicated server and a mirror server with a Load Balancer acting as a router. 
We are looking for colocation of all the Hardware-- 2 Sun Sparc 10s, 1 Micron PC, and 1 Monitor with keyboard.
We are running Oracle (8I) version 8.1.7. Software and Licensing is purchased through the USAF.
Both system will be capable to be used as Database Servers--they are mirror images is one goes down then the other pickup as the primary DB Server. Only one will run at a time, while the load balancer distribute the information to the other. 
The Firewall issue can be discussed and modification can be done to this area.
Access to DB area is already granted through CGI scripts inplace. We also have access to the entire server via Telnet.
The primary service and bid request is for Fractional T1 or Full T1, with Colocation hosting of the DLIELC.org System, as well as software and technical support. Not purchasing hardware.
The website is using the following software: Oracle, Java, Perl, Apache, HTML, and Solaris.

<SUBJECT>69 -- Recruit Training Command Battle Stations Exercise

<DESC>The RFI is modified to provide responses to the questions that have been submitted regarding Battle Stations, and to provide the Updated Architecture Plan for the Recruit Training Center, Great Lakes, IL, as additional information.  Please review the Updated Architecture Plan attached in Acrobat Reader Format.  

Question 1: Are we designing and building a complete new facility to house these 12 exercises?
Response:  Yes.   While the exact contract strategy has not been finalized, the project will eventually result in the design and construction of a single facility to house the scenarios.
Question 2:  Can this facility compound be divided two, three or four different buildings?
Response:  Current Navy desire is to incorporate into a single building (driven by available real-estate at RTC).
Question 3:  Can we repurpose or utilize any of the existing infrastructure?
Response:  Unlikely.  Most of the current infrastructure is either used for regular training, or is not desirable for incorporation.
Question 4:  Is the 6 mile run currently taking place considered part of the exercise or a by product of the current facility layout?  i.e., do the recruits need to run 6 miles?
Response:  The running came about because of the need for the recruits to transit to each scenario and to allow for timing and sequencing of groups.  However, it is desirable to eliminate the running due to injury rates that are incurred.  The desired approach is to find other ways within the scenario to induce rigor and to provide sequencing/timing.
Question 5:  What is the previously-developed initial concept referred to in the RFI?
Response:  An initial concept for one potential approach was developed under an "Other Transaction Agreement" with a leading entertainment and attraction company. 
Question 6:  Is an existing script or detailed concept available, or does this need to be added to the ROM?
Response:  There is no existing script at this time.  Only a concept for an overall theme for the exercise.   If an RFP is issued, it will probably include further development of concepts and the development of "scripts."
Question 7:  If the concept for each exercise is not available, can we at least get an idea of the duration time for each one of these exercises?
Response:  The overall exercise is 12 hours.  Each scenario is roughly one hour long.  Of course, in practice, different recruit teams finish scenarios in different amounts of time.  The current approach is to use the running to makeup for the time (synchronization). 
Question 8:  Our ROM will detail the design approach, including number and length of each of the design phases.  Will you require a Factory Acceptance Test (FAT)?  A Site Acceptance Test (SAT)?  Please state your preferences.
Response:  While the exact acquisition strategy has not been completely developed, the general approach at this time is to conduct Preliminary Design Reviews, Critical Design Reviews, then on-site acceptance testing using a team-developed set of Test Procedures.
Question 9:  Does it matter if the order of the scenarios (exercises) change compared to the order of the powerpoint printout?
Response:  The order does not matter.  With the possible exception of General Quarters, all of the scenarios are conducted in parallel.  Right now, it's done as a modified shotgun start with teams in each scenario.  In some cases the order is different for different teams.  This is necessary to meet the throughput requirements of the exercise each night (approx 460 - 500 recruits).
Question 10:  Will you provide further background information where it references actual historical experiences upon which these scenarios are based?  Will you have a consultant available to us?
Response:  Yes, that can be done.  The Subject Matter Experts at RTC Great Lakes will be available and an integral member of the development team.
Question 11:  What part of the historical experiences are most critical to the present experience?
Response:  Hard to say.  With recent events, scenarios with a 'force protection' flavor will probably be of highest interest.
Question 12:  Will you be providing actors for each of the scenarios?  Will this castrequire directorial and stunt training from the turnkey vendor?
Response:  Yes.  The 'actors' would be the Battle Stations 'facilitators' who fill the role now.  Training for this staff would probably be a very beneficial addition to the contract.
Question 13:  Does the General Quarters scenario take place in the trainees normal barracks?  Or will they be moved to the set for this experience?
Response:  Currently it is performed in the barracks.  If possible, would probably be more effective if done as part of the exercise in tighter compartments.
Question 14:  Please provide a further description of the Marlinspike in the Emergency Sortie scene.  Is this an existing ship and dock?  How big is the facility?  If we are to duplicate hurricane conditions, the facility would need to be evaluated for installation of wave machines, etc.
Response:  The "Marlinspike" is a mockup of a ship and pier in an existing, separate facility.  Since the Marlinspike is currently used for recruit training in line-handling, implementation of a new Battle Stations would require the development, design and construction of another mockup.
Question 15:  Given that these exercises are more for assessment then training will you need to develop a system for acquiring performance data?
Response:  This is a topic of intense discussion within the Navy right now.  While there is not a current plan to formally acquire performance data, it is seen by many as an essential part of measuring the benefit of Battle Stations.

<SUBJECT>A -- Advanced Concepts
<DESC>The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend US deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack.  As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capability or improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats.  
	
	To investigate these new technologies, MDA has established an Advanced Concepts (AC) Deputate whose mission is to pursue and assess innovative concepts and develop algorithms to improve BMDS capability.  MDA/AC has established a team of scientists and engineers from government, industry, and academia to advance the BMDS.  In an effort to expand this team, MDA/AC intends to award cooperative agreements with various universities to undertake research in the following broad areas: (1)Radar Systems, (2)Lasers and Electro-Optical Systems, (3)Mathematics and Computer Science, (4)Electrical Engineering, (5)Physics and Chemistry, (6)Mathematical and Aerospace Engineering, and (7)Battle Management/Command and Control.

For a more detailed description of these areas, please contact the point-of-contact listed below.

	In order to obtain access to researchers within these areas, MDA intends to award cooperative agreements with selected universities.  These agreements will allow MDA to acquire research on an on-call basis through the issuance of Task Orders. MDA anticipates issuing orders totaling $2 million in fiscal year 2002, with individual orders ranging from approximately $100,000 to $250,000.  The award of a cooperative agreement does not guarantee receipt of a Task Order.  
	
	Prior to issuing a Task Order, the MDA Grants Officer will issue a draft Task Order containing a Statement of Objectives, period of performance, and a description of deliverables.  In response, the university will submit a Task/Program Plan, which will include the approach to accomplish the tasks, as well as a budgetary plan/estimate.  MDA will review the Task Plan, and either award an Order or advise the university of required changes to the Task Plan.  Once MDA and the university have agreed on the Task Plan, the final Order will be issued.    

	If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) identify the specific areas of interest you wish to include in your cooperative agreement, (2) a brief synopsis (maximum of 2 pages each) of your capabilities and past research activities for each area of interest you have identified, and (3) identify the principal investigators by area of interest, as well as provide their resumes/credentials.

	MDA will evaluate these responses based upon the university demonstrating (1) its capability in the areas it selected, as shown through its past research and (2) the qualifications of its proposed principal investigators.  

	Please provide your response by February 28, 2002.  Responses may be submitted electronically (PDF or Word format) to Sherri Nosar, Contracts Specialist, at sherri.nosar@mda.osd.mil.
If you have any questions concerning this initiative, or need additional time to complete this request, please contact Ms. Nosar at (703) 695-9107.

<SUBJECT>B -- MOUND LONG-TERM STEWARDSHIP INITIATIVE (LTSI) MONITORING TECHNOLOGIES
<DESC>BWXT of Ohio, Inc. (BWTXO), Prime Contractor for the United States Department of Energy's (DOE's) Miamisburg Environmental Management Project (MEMP), Miamisburg, Montgomery County, Ohio, seeks QUALIFIED SOURCE(s) to provide innovative or improved technologies for deployment by the Long-Term Stewardship Initiative (LTSI) Project at the DOE Mound site in Miamisburg OH. The DOE Office of Science and Technology (OST), EM-50, Deactivation and Decommission Focus Area (DDFA) is sponsoring through BWXTO a LTSI Project at the MEMP to identify post-closure facility monitoring needs and to find and deploy technologies to support them. The LTSI Project intends to obtain a list of qualified vendors to provide these innovative or improved technologies for long-term environmental monitoring.

A Vendor Workshop for experienced commercial vendors in long-term monitoring technologies will be conducted in Miamisburg, OH in early April 2002. The objective of the Workshop will be to conduct significant interactions among DOE, BWXTO and Commercial Vendors with expertise in environmental monitoring technologies.  Emphasis will be placed on a Vendor's previous operational experience and successes.  The expected outcome from the Workshop will be the issuance of a Request for Proposal and the expected deployment of environmental monitoring technologies during the third quarter of government fiscal year 2002.

The MEMP is a 306-acre DOE closure site currently undergoing Deactivation and Decommissioning (D&D) activities before being turned over to Miamisburg Mound Community Improvement Corporation (MMCIC) for reuse.  The current contractor, BWXTO, is decontaminating facilities at Mound to either demolish or transfer them to the MMCIC for office, research and standard industrial use The Project is seeking candidate technologies that are fully developed and ready for full-scale deployment that will provide more efficient and less costly monitoring than is planned.  These technologies should improve on the labor-intensive on-site sampling and analysis and should also improve confidence that the chosen institutional controls are protective of human health and the environment.  

The LTSI Project will, in the near term, seek technologies for post-closure monitoring of the institutional controls in place for land parcels already transferred to the MMCIC for re-use.  These institutional controls are in the form of Deed Restrictions that, among other things, prohibit removal of soil or installation of wells without prior approval from the State of Ohio, and require land use to remain Industrial.  The LTSI Project seeks technologies to implement these institutional controls in the most cost-effective manner, ideally, by minimizing reliance on onsite personnel to monitor and/or maintain the monitoring systems.  The LTSI Project will continue to seek technologies to address varied but specific LTS issues over the ensuing three years.  The next initiative will seek to remotely monitor buildings that have residual levels of radiological or hazardous material contamination (i.e., residual contamination associated with the building itself, or the surrounding environ).  In order for the MMCIC to effectively market these buildings to prospective tenants, building occupants must be assured that residual radiological or hazardous material contaminants have not migrated or caused a negative impact on human health and the environment.  All of the above technologies should gather and transmit data (ideally, in an unobtrusive and real-time/near-real time manner) with a minimum of human intervention and equipment maintenance.  At some later date, the project may deploy relevant technologies at other DOE closure sites to address their specific LTS issues.

An Internet Web Site will provide additional details on the project and links to support documents, questionnaires, directions for submitting the required information, and information on the upcoming workshop.  Theprerequisite for a company attending the Workshop is that they have successfully deployed environmental monitoring technologies/strategies at multiple sites AND that they submit to the web site information about their company (Corporate Capabilities) and deployments (Project Histories).  Interested companies can access information about the "Mound Long-Term Stewardship Initiative" at http://web.ead.anl.gov/techcon/projects/moundltsi.  This project web site will also provide questionnaires and directions for submitting the required information on Corporate Capabilities and Project Histories. 

The information provided by the responders at this web site will be the only source used for preparing a List of INTERESTED, PRE-QUALIFIED SOURCES. Only those responders selected for the Pre-Qualified list will receive an invitation to the Workshop and subsequently an RFP expected to be issued during the second quarter of government fiscal year 2002. All responses must be posted to the web site by 03/04/02. TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. 

Technical POC is: Joyce Massie (BWXT), (937) 865-3888, Email: massja@doe-md.gov

The Workshop will be organized and facilitated by the project team under the guidance of a Steering Committee consisting of representatives from LTSI Project Team.  The Workshop will be co-sponsored by DOE, BWXT, DDFA, and SCFA.
