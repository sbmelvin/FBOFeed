<CONTACT>Candace S. Tucker, Phone 2568764900, Email candace.s.tucker.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p>Using the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the US Army Aviation &amp; Missile Research, Development &amp; Engineering Center (AMRDEC), Weapons Development &amp; Integration Directorate (WDI), Fire Support Capability Area (FSCA) is interested in receiving submittals from Offerors adept to identify, develop, integrate and flight demonstrate emerging long-range missile system technologies in support of the Army's Long Range Fires (LRF) combat mission. AMRDEC is inviting Offerors with demonstrated experience in the design, fabrication, integration, flight test, and fielding of tactical missile systems to submit Concept Papers and subsequently, upon express request by AMRDEC, formal Proposals. Concept Papers and proposals are to be focused on the design, fabrication, integration and flight-test demonstration of those component-level and system-level technologies necessary to enhance the range, precision and/or lethality of Army LRF against stationary and/or mobile land and/or sea targets, at ranges beyond 300 km, in all operating environments, while maintaining compatibility with the Army's existing Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Family of Munitions (MFOM) Launch Platforms to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p>Proposals with new and innovative technologies are needed which could enhance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge for the technical areas listed below. Proposals should address and focus on one or more of the technical areas and capability demonstration listed. AMRDEC is interested in demonstrating technical advances in the following technology areas: (1) Inertial Navigation Technology - Highly accurate, low cost inertial sensors enabling precision long range navigation in GPS degraded or denied environments; (2) Multi-mode Seeker Technology - Active and/or passive seekers enabling target detection, acquisition, tracking, discrimination and aim-point selection in GPS degraded or denied environments; (3) High-temperature "Seeker Friendly" Dome Materials - High temperature "seeker friendly" dome materials capable of withstanding the thermal environments resulting from extended range, high velocity flight profiles, while simultaneously maximizing RF/IR/etc. seeker performance; (4) Signature Reduction Technology - Active and/or passive means of reducing the signature of the LRF Munition in the RF, IR and other common military detection bands; (5) Warhead Technology - Kinetic and Non-Kinetic means of enabling enhanced lethality and reduced packaging envelopes (weight and/or volume); (6) Digital Datalink Technology - Communication elements enabling secure smart-weapon network integration (aim-point coordination, arrival time synchronization, etc.); (7) Propulsion Technology - Enhanced performance propulsion systems (solid rocket motor, hybrid, gel, liquid, air-breathing, etc.) enabling extended range LRF missions; and (8) Attitude Control Technology - Enhanced performance altitude control systems (divert thrusters, canards, fins, jet vanes, etc.) enabling improved weapon system maneuverability, reduced packaging envelopes (weight and/or volume) and/or reduced power consumption. AMRDEC is interested in demonstrating the resulting technology-driven performance enhancements via sub-scale or full-scale flight test, potentially utilizing Army-provided MFOM test assets.</p>
<p>All development activities related to this BAA are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data, the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, Executive Order 12470, and/or DOD Directive 5230.25. Foreign Nationals are not eligible to access US classified information. Since awards to US contractors will involve access to classified information, any US contractor or subcontractor considering this BAA cannot have foreign nationals working on the effort. This acquisition is not open to foreign firms, including any subcontracting effort under this BAA. Any contractor or subcontractor considering this BAA is advised that foreign national employees are prohibited from participating or working under this effort. For the purposes of accessing US classified information, Foreign Nationals (also known as foreign persons) means any person who is NOT a US citizen or naturalized citizen of the US, a lawful permanent resident; or a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b (a)(3).</p>
<p>The application process for this BAA includes two stages as follows: Stage 1-Prospective proposers should submit concept papers prior to the submission of a complete, more detailed proposal. Concept papers should follow the format, content and submission criteria outlined in this notice. Stage 2-Interested Offerors will be contacted within 120 days to submit full proposals. Unsuccessful Offerors will receive notification of the results of their concept paper review within 120 days. Concept papers and proposals will not be returned.</p>
<p>Concept Paper<br />In Stage 1, Offerors should submit a summary concept paper for evaluation. Concept papers must be emailed directly to the email address identified at the end of this announcement. Concept papers should address the required content and adhere to the format detailed below to be considered for Stage 2. In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist Offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that the Offerors first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation. From this summary concept paper the Government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Government and whether a formal proposal would be likely to succeed. The Government, at its option, may provide comments that might be of assistance to the submitter in determining how or whether to submit a BAA proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated as soon as they are received. Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will not be made, and concept papers will not be returned. THE CONTRACTING OFFICE WILL ASK ONLY THOSE OFFERORS WITH PROMISING CONCEPT PAPERS TO SUBMIT FULL TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS. Offerors are not authorized to submit a formal proposal unless expressly requested to do so by the Contracting Office. Because of the flight test driven focus of this effort and the specified 48-month period of performance, Offerors must be able to show demonstrated experience in the definition, development, production, flight-demonstration, and deployment of fielded U.S. Weapon Systems in order to be considered for evaluation. Offerors are NOT authorized to submit a formal proposal unless expressly requested to do so by the Contracting Office. The Contracting Office will notify Offerors within 120 days of receipt of concept paper if a full proposal is requested. Concept papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data. All proprietary material should be clearly marked. The summary concept paper should state the proposed technical concept including the rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and its contribution to the AMRDEC. In addition, the summary concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost and Offeror's past performance on Government contracts. The concept paper shall adhere to the following format: 1) File Type: Microsoft Word (.docx); 2) Page Size: 8&frac12; x 11 inches, 1 inch Margins, single-spaced; 3) Font: Arial, 12 point (text); Arial, 10 point (captions &amp; tables); 4) Page Count: No more than ten (10) pages, not including a cover page, table of contents, definitions and references. Concept papers exceeding the page limit will not be evaluated. Pages shall be numbered consecutively. Proprietary material should be clearly marked. The statement "Releasable to Government Agencies and their supporting Contractors for Review Only" must accompany any proprietary submission. No classified data shall be included.</p>

<p>Concept Paper Evaluation<br />Concept Papers will be distributed by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to the designated Government Subject Matter Expert (SME) team for review and evaluation weekly. Every 15 days, the SME team chairperson will provide the COR with a numerical rating and summary of all concept papers received in the SME's designated Technology Focus Area during the 15 day evaluation period. At the end of 30 days, if a concept paper is selected for a Request for Proposal (RFP), the SME team chairperson will provide a detailed summary of all evaluations completed during the 30 days prior to the request and a justification for selecting that particular concept paper for RFP. The COR will be responsible for sending the evaluation to the AMRDEC Acquisition Office every 60 days, or before if a RFP is required. Acquisition has 120 days to provide a response (negative/ RFP) to the contractor. Concept papers will be evaluated using the following criteria: Concept Papers will be reviewed by AMRDEC personnel and their support contractors to ensure that the Offeror meets the specified experience and capability requirements, and that the submitted concept falls within the stated objectives of the BAA. Concept papers that fail to satisfy either criteria will not be formally evaluated. Selected Concept Papers will be formally evaluated by AMRDEC personnel and their support contractors. AMRDEC will base the technical merit evaluation on the contractor's demonstrated capability and competence in categories that include: 1) Understanding and insight into the LRF mission role within Army combat doctrine; 2) Understanding and insight into the emerging threats driving the need for LRF performance improvements; 3) Understanding and insight into current state-of-the-art and emerging/near-term long-range missile system technologies; 4) Demonstrated experience in the development, delivery, integration and flight demonstrating new missile system technologies; and 5) Perceived value to AMRDEC of the proposed capability enhancements to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>Concept Paper Evaluation Scoring<br />The following numerical ratings will be applied to the evaluation criteria:<br />- Demonstrated understanding of the evolving LRF Mission Requirements and emerging Threats (25 points) <br />- Demonstrated understanding of state-of-the-art and emerging/near-term long range missile system technologies (25 points)<br />- Proposed technology development, integration and flight demonstration of performance enhancement technologies within Army LRF missiles (25 points)<br />- Demonstrated missile system technology development and transfer experience (15 points)<br />- Cost reasonableness (10 points)</p>
<p>The overall ratings for combined criteria for concept papers is as follows: Excellent (80+), Good (79-59), Unsatisfactory (&lt;59). Concept papers receiving an overall rating of less than 80 will not be considered for a request for proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to request further clarification or request presentations to enhance our understanding of the Offeror's submittal as part of the Evaluation process. If there is sufficient interest within the Government, a formal proposal will be requested from the Offeror. Contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals unless invited to do so by the Contracting Office. The Contracting Office will notify Offerors within 120 days as to whether or not their concept paper was selected for formal proposal. Concept papers not selected for formal proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE CONCEPT PAPER RESPONSES RECEIVED.</p>

<p>Content.<br />The Government will provide SELECTED Offerors with proposal content requirements. Generally, proposal content and format shall contain and not be limited to: (1) Performance Work Statement (PWS): The PWS should be a concise document suitable for incorporation into a resultant contract. It should provide a qualitative description of the proposed work, which should be described in terms of advancement, improvement, or end product to be developed. The PWS should state the objectives to be achieved and how these objectives would benefit the Government. These objectives should be stated in terms of their potential usefulness to the advancement of tactical missile propulsion technology. The PWS should also include a proposed schedule detailing significant milestones and deliverables; (2) One page resumes of the Offeror's key personnel (including alternates, if desired) who will be involved in the research. Documentation of previous work or experience in the field of the proposer is especially important; (3) The type of support, if any, the Offeror requests of the AMRDEC, such as facilities, equipment, or materials. Any request by Offerors for Government furnished property/equipment must be clearly identified in the proposal. The Government is under no obligation to comply with such requests. Thus, Offerors should make provisions for alternate approaches in the event the Government is unwilling or unable to provide the requested property/equipment; (4) A statement regarding possible impact, if any, of the proposal's effect on the environment; (5) A brief description of your organization; (6) The facilities to be used for the work, if appropriate for and understanding of the proposal; (7) A listing of current similar R&amp;D contracts along with Government POCs (contracting officer &amp; technical) shall be included. The financial portion of the proposal should contain a cost estimate that is sufficiently detailed by element of cost for meaningful evaluation and must include sufficient detail to support and explain all costs proposed, giving figures and narrative explanation. Cost proposals must contain certifiable cost or pricing data, and shall be in sufficient detail to allow direct and indirect rate verification. The budget must include the total estimated cost of the project. The estimated project costs must be broken down for each year of the program to show the following: (1) A list of participants, not necessarily by name, showing the time and number of direct productive person hours (DPPHs) to be charged by principal investigator(s), research associates, and assistants, and the total amount per year to be paid to each from the project. For proposals from universities, the time and amounts to be charged should be identified by academic year and summer effort; (2) An itemized list of permanent equipment showing the cost of each item. Permanent equipment is any article of non-expendable tangible personal property having a useful life of more than two years, and an acquisition cost of $500 or more per unit; (3) A general description and total estimated cost of expendable equipment and supplies; (4) Contemplated expenditures for travel with brief explanation. Travel budgets that exceed $1,500 per principal investigator per year or that include foreign travel or travel by other than principal investigators will require special investigation; (5) Other direct costs; (6) Cost for consulting services, if any, showing number of days, daily rates, and estimated travel/per diem costs. The need for consulting services must be fully justified; (7) Indirect costs indicating whether rates used are fixed or provisional, and the time frames to which they are applicable (e.g., a fixed rate may apply until a specified date, after which the rate becomes provisional); (8) The fee, if any, which the organization proposes to assess the research project; (9) Subcontracts and material costs proposed must be fully supported and documented (written quotes, engineering estimates, etc.). Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy. Subcontracting goals for small businesses are thirty-five (35%) percent. Subcontracting goals for small disadvantage businesses, and women-owned small businesses are five (5%) percent. Subcontracting goals for HUBZone small businesses, for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and Historically Black Colleges &amp; University/Minority Institutions (HBCUs/MIs) are three (3%) percent. Pursuant to FAR 19.708, all formal proposals over $550,000 that are not submitted by a small business concern will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan with their formal proposal. These goals are to be considered when proposals are submitted.</p>
<p>Potential Deliverables.<br />The following is a list of possible Contract Data Requirements that might be required when submitting a proposal. The following reports may be required (specific reporting requirements will be specified by the Government in the event a contractor is requested to submit a formal proposal): 1) DI-ADMN-81373, Presentational Material, as required; 2) DI-ADMN-81505, Report, Record of Meeting/Minutes, as required; 3) DI-MGMT-80004A, Management Plan, as required; 4) DI-MGMT-80227, Contractor's Progress, Status and Management Report, as required; 5) DI-MISC-80508B, Technical Report - Study/Services (Final), as required; 6) DI-MISC-80508B, Technical Report - Study/Services (Interim), as required; 7) DI-NDTI-80809B, Test/Inspection Report, as required; 8) DI-QCIC-80553A, Acceptance Test Plan, as required; 9) DI-SESS-81001E, Conceptual Design Drawings/Models, as required; 10) DI-SESS-81002F, Developmental Design Drawings/Models &amp; Associated Lists, as required; 11) DI-SESS-81248B, Interface Control Document DI-SESS-81704, Test Plans/Test Procedures, as required; 12) US Army Contractor Manpower Reporting Requirements, as required.</p>
<p>Long term proposals should contain a summary of the work contemplated for each 12-month period, so that contracts may be negotiated for an entire five-year project or for individual one-year increments of the total project. A detailed performance schedule for each discrete task must be included along with cost data to include labor-by-labor category. To be eligible for award of a contract, a prospective contractor must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, and ability to comply with the performance schedule. The frequency and type of data item will vary due to research topic and proposal content.</p>
<p>THIS ACQUISITION IS NOT OPEN TO FOREIGN PARTICIPATION AT ANY LEVEL.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that contract awards resulting from this BAA will be in the form of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts with total period of performance estimated to be up to 48 months, including time for preparation, approval, and distribution of the final report. For planning purposes, individual awards are anticipated from $1.0M up to $135M, with the combined total of all BAA awards not to exceed $148M. Multiple awards are possible. The Government reserves the right to make awards without discussions with Offerors. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions with Offerors prior to contract award if the technical monitor determines them to be necessary.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that any contract resulting from this BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22 Limitation of Funds. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement. The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical merit, importance to agency programs, and funds availability. Management, cost realism and reasonableness, and past performance shall also be considered. The following factors will be considered in the evaluation of proposals received under this BAA.</p>
<p>Proposal Evaluation Criteria<br />Award consideration will be based on technical, cost, and the contractor's past performance. AMRDEC will base the Technical Evaluation on the contractor's proposal to include the following criteria: 1) demonstrated understanding of LRF mission within Army combat doctrine and emerging threats to be engaged; 2) demonstrated understanding and experience in advanced emerging technologies required for long range missile systems; 3) proposed innovative concepts and missile technology enhancements supported by engineering analysis, integration and test activities required to successfully conduct a flight demonstration; 4) proposed resources (equipment, facilities, personnel) and experience to perform the proposed fabrication, integration and test effort and transition developed technologies; and 5) potential contribution to AMRDEC's Long Range Fires mission.</p>
<p>The Cost Evaluation on contractor's proposal will be based on the following criteria: 1) Cost reasonableness of the contractor's cost proposal will be evaluated. Cost reasonableness means a fair and reasonable price; i.e., the price that a prudent businessperson would pay for an item or service under competitive market conditions, given a reasonable knowledge of the marketplace. Reflects a clear understanding of the requirements, and is consistent with the various elements of the other parts of the proposal; 2) Finally, the government will assess the risk associated with the contractor's cost proposal.</p>
<p>The Past Performance Evaluation will be based on demonstrated successful execution of past weapon system definition, development, and test efforts. Elements to be evaluated include the following criteria: 1) relevancy of cited programs; 2) recency of cited programs: 3) successful satisfaction of SOW objectives in cited programs; 4) adherence to development and delivery schedules in cited programs; and 5) adherence to program budgets in cited programs.<br /><br />Proposal Evaluation Scoring<br />The following numerical ratings will be applied to the evaluation criteria: <br />Technical 60%<br />- Understanding LRF mission and emerging threats (10%)<br />- Understanding and experience in advanced technologies (10%)<br />- Proposed demonstration program supported by engineering and test (20%)<br />- Proposed resources and experience to perform proposed program (10%)<br />- Potential contribution to AMRDEC's Long Range Fires mission/Importance to Agency Programs (10%)<br />Cost: 20%<br />- Cost Reasonableness (10%)<br />- Cost Risk (10%)<br />Past Performance: 20%<br />- Relevancy (10%)<br />- Recency (10%)</p>
<p>The overall ratings for combined criteria for proposals is as follows: Excellent (80+), Good (79-59), Unsatisfactory (&lt;59). Proposals receiving an overall rating of less than 80 will not be considered for a contract award.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to request further clarification or request presentations to enhance our understanding of the Offeror's submittal as part of the Evaluation process. In accordance with the guidelines described in FAR 15.605 and 35.008, primary emphasis in the evaluation will be given to the Technical assessment, which is deemed significantly more important than the Cost assessment.</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE PROPOSAL RESPONSES RECEIVED.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make awards without discussions with Offerors. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions with Offerors prior to contract award if the technical monitor determines them to be necessary.</p>

This Sources Sought Synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quote (RFQ), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. Wright-Patterson AFB is requesting information on Air Force (AF) Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) in support of the Air Force Institute of Technology. The purpose of this RFI is for market research to identify potential contractors capable of providing AFIT A&amp;AS support in accordance to the attached Performance Work Statement (PWSs). The Government anticipates two Cost Plus Fixed Fee contracts, consisting of one base month, plus five (5) option months. The period of performance of the base month is anticipated to be 1 December 2016 through 31 December 2016. These contracts will only be issued in the event source selection schedule delays and will act as a bridge as these requirements are in the process of being subsumed by the AFLCMC ENGINEERING, PROFESSIONAL, and ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT SERVICES (EPASS) program.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />CAPABILITY PACKAGE REQUIREMENTS: Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time.

All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. The NAICS code for this requirement, if applicable to the company's capabilities, should be included in the company's NAICS code listing in SAM. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</span></p>

No facsimile responses will be accepted. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this RFI nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. The Request for Proposals (RFP) or Request for Quotes (RFQ) will be issued electronically. The RFP/RFQ will be issued TBD.</span></p>

<p>This requirement is for repair services. Our repair services strategy is a three-year contract (basic plus two option years) and will continue through FY21. The projected quantities will be Best Estimated Quantities (BEQ) of 780 per year.</p>
<p>The Government's needs for repair services are required in order to support current combat capabilities for multiple air and ground platforms. MIDS is an advanced command, control, communications, computing and intelligence system incorporating high-capacity, jam-resistant, digital communication links for exchange of near real-time tactical information, including both data and voice, among air, ground, and sea elements. MIDS supports key theater functions such as surveillance, identification, air control, weapons engagement coordination and direction for all Services.</p>
<p>MIDS-LVT Technical Description - MIDS is a secure, jam resistant and high capacity communication and positioning system that uses a uniquely defined waveform in the 960-1215 Megahertz (MHz) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) range for digital voice and packet message communication. MIDS is interoperable with AN/URC-107 (JTIDS) terminals that utilize the Joint Interoperability of Tactical Command and Control Systems (JINTACCS) TADIL-J series message standard defined in Military Standard (MIL-STD) 6016. MIDS provides JTIDS functionality at reduced cost, weight and size thereby meeting space limitations for aircraft and other platforms. MIDS is capable of exchanging Link-16 J Series messages and voice concurrently among other MIDS and JTIDS Class 2 terminals in a hostile Electromagnetic Environment (EME). MIDS contains a Secure Data Unit (SDU) embedded in the Signal Message Processor (SMP). The nodeless system distributes encrypted information at high data rates and with jamming resistance sufficient to produce highly reliable and assured communications in a hostile EME. MIDS will interface with existing communications and data systems on host platforms and work successfully in any required application. MIDS NSNs will also be one and two way interchangeable/linked with NSNs purchased and repaired via a second vendor repairing like sub configurations.</p>
<p>MIDS Configurations</p>
<p>While the MIDS terminal has common basic functionality, unique military service components and platform requirements have resulted in three primary terminal configurations that are available in several MIDS International Program Office approved products. These three main configurations are made up of twelve different sub configurations.</p>
<p>MIDS-LVT (1) Family</p>
<p>The MIDS-LVT(1) Family consists of the LVT(1), LVT(4), LVT(5), LVT(6) and LVT(7) Receiver Transmitters and was developed during the Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase of the MIDS program. It is a pre-planned product improvement of the JTIDS Class 2 terminal. The MIDS terminal provides a Link-16 capability for space and weight constrained platforms, for example; USN F/A-18, USAF F-16, Rafale and Eurofighter. This includes all airborne, ground and maritime platforms throughout the Department of Defense. However, numerous other platforms are integrating MIDS. The MIDS-LVT(1) configuration consists of two Line Replaceable Units (LRU's), the Receiver/Transmitter (R/T) and the Remote Power Supply (RPS). The R/T contains all digital and Radio Frequency (RF) functions and the post regulator and control section of the power supply. The maximum distance between terminal and irradiating RF antenna is 50 feet. The RPS contains the power line filters and the pre regulator section of the power supply that can be located up to 15 feet away from the R/T. The ability to physically separate these LRUs provides flexibility in adapting the MIDS-LVT(1) for integration on an array of platforms with varying installation and power source requirements.</p>
<p>Discrete interface characteristics for platform specific requirements reside in the R/T Interface (R/TI) Shop Replaceable Unit (SRU). The terminal has four data bus interfaces:</p>
<p>&bull; MIL-STD-1553 and prEN 3910 (STANAG 3838) reside on the Avionics Multiplexer (MUX) located in the Data Processor (DP)/Avionics MUX SRU.</p>
<p>&bull; Ethernet and X.25 reside on the Ground MUX located in the Tailored Processor (TP)/Ground MUX SRU.</p>
<p>Data bus interface message formats reside in the computer S/W for the avionics and ground communications processor and are reused among platforms. Many platform specific functions have been integrated into the Tailored Input/Output (TI/O) Computer Software Configuration Item (CSCI), making these functions available for other platforms, although not all platforms have separate configuration items.</p>
<p><br />MIDS-LVT(2) Family<br /><br />The MIDS-LVT(2) Family consists of the LVT(2), LVT(11) and LVT(12) and was developed to meet U.S. Army (USA) requirements as an improvement to the JTIDS Class 2M terminal. LVT(2) is functionally equivalent and is a direct retrofit of the Army JTIDS Class 2M terminal, since it reuses the JTIDS Class 2M host interface . Although it was initially developed for the Army, it has since been adapted for use by the Air Force and Marine Corp as a ground based data link system. <br /><br />The LVT(2) is based upon the LVT(1) design using some tailored modules and is fully interoperable with all MIDS LVT and JTIDS. It has a more adaptable power supply and a cooling system needed for ground based applications. The R/T contains the host interface data processing, signal processing, interference protection features, input/output, receive/transmit, and post regulator and control functions of the power supply. The Power Supply Assembly (PSA) accepts primary input power and delivers the required power to the R/T and Cooling Unit (CU). The LRUs are attached on a single mounting plate to duplicate the same installation footprint as the JTIDS 2M. The Army variant excludes TACAN and voice capabilities and uses unique interface S/W. <br /><br />MIDS-LVT(3)<br /><br />The MIDS-LVT(3) (also referred to as the Fighter Data Link - FDL) was designed for the U.S. Air Force (USAF) F-15 to meet a reduced set of operational requirements (notably the 50-Watt Power Amplifier). The two main components are the R/T and RPS LRUs, similar to the LVT(1). Two of the terminal SRUs are tailored for the MIDS-LVT(3), while four other SRUs and one CSCI are unique.</p>
<p>The MIDS-LVT(3) reuses the JTIDS S/W that interfaces with the Operational Flight Program developed for the F-15 JTIDS program, as well as the Role On Beyond Line of Site Enhancement Program (ROBE). The MIDS-LVT(3) S/W has a common configuration across F-15 A/B/C/D/E platforms. The MIDS-LVT(3) does not provide TACAN or Voice, although these are future growth capabilities. Other important differences between LVT(3) and LVT(1) are: a) lower power output of 50 Watts, and b) an interface has been tailored for F-15 aircraft.<br /><br />CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY<br />Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) AN/USQ-140(V)</p>

<p>The APN-209/Altimeter/ (LRU), function by provide accurate height measurements above the ground with a high degree of accuracy and integrity during the approach, landing and climb phases of an aircraft. A high degree of accuracy and integrity of measurements must be achieved regardless of the terrain surface, such as during final approach and flare guidance in the last stages of automated approach to land. Altimeters also determine the particular altitude in which the aircraft can safely land. The system also provide input to the terrain awareness warning systems (TAWS), which gives a "pull up" warning at a predetermined altitude and closure rate. It supports the missions of the UH-60, CH-47 and AH-64 Army helicopters and their availability is essential to successful, safe missions.</p>
<p>No technical data for the manufacture of these units is available from the Army. Any sources capable of manufacturing these units must so indicate, by writing to Commander, USACECOM, ATTN: RDER-PRA-AB, Building 6007, Aberdeen, MD 21005. The response must demonstrate knowledge of this APN-209, LRU, including physical and functional interchangeability at the shop replaceable unit and line replaceable unit.

<DESC><p>NOTICE:&nbsp; This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought to determine capability of potential sources and is for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Services (FAS), Office of General Supplies &amp; Services (GSS), Retail Operations branch requires a comprehensive range of commonly purchased industrial products and office supplies for its Government-operated GSA Global Supply Stores located on U.S. Air Base Kadena (Kadena AB)in Okinawa, Japan; U.S. Army Garrison Camp Zama (USAG Camp Zama), U.S. Air Base Misawa (Misawa AB), and U.S. Air Base Yokota (Yokota AB)Iwakuni; Osan and Kunsan Air Bases in Korea; and Camp Lemonier in Djibouti, Africa (Djibouti).&nbsp; Under GSA's 4th Party Logistics (4PL) program, Retail Operations is responsible for managing the resources, capabilities, and technology of its own organization, with support from its product and service providers, to deliver a comprehensive supply chain solution along with its requisitioning capabilities to Government customers. GSA Retail Operations 4PL solution provides more favorable product pricing, an increased breadth of products, as well as standardized ordering, packaging, documentation, and billing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the BPAs, vendors will provide GSA with commercial consigned inventory to support GSA's Global Supply Store operations.&nbsp; Essentially, that means that while the products are on the store shelves, they will be entrusted to GSA (are under the control and custody of GSA) in the storefronts although they are still owned by the vendors, vendor-owned/consigned inventory (VCI).&nbsp; GSA will not own the item until it is requisitioned and processed through GSA's Point of Sale (POS) system.&nbsp; At that point the item is sold to GSA and can be requisitioned by the customer in the GSA Global Supply stores.<br />&nbsp;<br />This Sources Sought is issued for information and planning purposes only.&nbsp; This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).&nbsp; It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.&nbsp; Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this Sources Sought.&nbsp; GSA will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This notice is an announcement that GSA is seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the products and services as described herein.&nbsp; GSA is currently conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources.&nbsp; The information requested by this Sources Sought will be used by GSA to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.&nbsp; However, respondents submitting business information pursuant to this Sources Sought should consult 41 C.F.R., part 105-60 and other implementing regulations concerning the release of such information to third parties under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).&nbsp; All information submitted by respondents that they consider confidential and not releasable to third parties outside of GSA, its employees, agents, consultants, and representatives, must be clearly and conspicuously so marked.</p>
<p>Statement of Objectives</p>
<p>GSA Retail Operations is seeking potential sources that are interested in or have the ability to provide industrial and office supplies on consignment to GSA through direct delivery in support of GSA's Global Supply and Retail storefronts located in Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>Under the industrial product BPA, the vendor will provide GSA and its customers with industrial type products, and tools, including, but not limited to: commercial coatings (including paints, sealants, adhesives, oils and abrasives); tools including, but not limited to, power tools, accessories, and hand tools; hardware; building supplies; safety products; precision tools and equipment; machinery and tooling components; tool holding and work holding equipment; outdoor equipment and accessories; material handling equipment, building supplies, and appliances.</p>
<p>Under the office supply BPA, the vendor will provide GSA and its customers with office type supplies that may include, but not limited to: basic office supplies; paper products; office appliances; office equipment; office furnishings; housekeeping supplies; computer accessories; office machines; and audio/visual supplies and equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These products represent the bulk of the buying activity at the GSA Retail Stores located in Japan, Korea, and Africa.</p>
<p>Interested sources are challenged to provide the most cost-effective approach that meets the following overall objectives:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Providing vendor-consigned inventory (stock) to GSA for resale to customers in its Japan and Korean stores. Each vendor, for their product category, will be required to consign stock to GSA; ownership of the vendor-consigned inventory (VCI) will be passed to GSA when the stock is requisitioned by its store customers and the transaction is processed through GSA's POS system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Of particular interest to the Government is the interested vendors' ability to deliver to Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) location versus a CONUS location, including such issues as supply chain transportation/shipping and distribution methods and practices, and replenishment and maintaining stock levels in an OCONUS Brick &amp; Mortar store environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Maintain min/max VCI levels, source new products in its assigned category, and provide delivery for products not stocked on-site.&nbsp; As the VCI drops to the minimum level, GSA will place an order via GSA's POS to the vendor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;GSA will provide individual storage areas for stocking of required products by each vendor.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;All vendors will communicate with GSA through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />GSA intends to establish a limited number of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for products to fill requisition orders.&nbsp; GSA intends to issue one BPA for industrial products and one BPA for office supplies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes for industrial products are 444130 (size standard $7.5M); 444110 (size standard $38.5M); and 444190 (size standard $20.5M).&nbsp; For office supplies the proposed NAICS codes are 322230 (size standard 750 employees) and 339940 (size standard 750).&nbsp; The Government requests that all interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify their small or large business status to the identified or proposed NAICS code.</p>

GSA Retail Operations 4PL solution provides more favorable product pricing, provides "just-in-time" inventory, an increased breadth of products, as well as standardized ordering, packaging, documentation, and billing.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />This Sources Sought is issued for information and planning purposes only.&nbsp; This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).&nbsp; It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.&nbsp; Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this Sources Sought.&nbsp; GSA will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This FedBizOpps notice is an announcement seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the products and or services as described herein.&nbsp; GSA is currently conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources.&nbsp; The information requested by this Sources Sought will be used by GSA to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.&nbsp; However, respondents submitting business information pursuant to this Sources Sought should consult 41 C.F.R., part 105-60 and other implementing regulations concerning the release of such information to third parties under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).&nbsp; All information submitted by respondents that they consider confidential and not releasable to third parties outside of GSA, its employees, agents, consultants, and representatives, must be clearly and conspicuously so marked.</p>
<p>Statement of Objectives</p>
<p>GSA Retail Operations is looking to offer a complete category management to its RIA-JMTC and SKOT Group customers requiring a specific array of products.&nbsp; GSA is requesting potential sources to provide products that fall within numerous categories that will be made available for requisition from GSA from its RIA-JMTC and SKOT Group customers to support their missions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RIA-JMTC receives requirements from all of the services to provide design, prototyping, manufacturing, testing and simulation services.&nbsp; RIA-JMTC utilizes the Department of Defense's (DoD's) only fully integrated manufacturing facility and the only remaining DoD foundry. Their spectrum of service capabilities include engineering, casting, laser cutting, machining, welding, painting, assembly, non-destructive testing and simulation, and the foundry.</p>
<p>SKOT Group manages over 50 of the Army's Combat Engineer and Ordnance Sets, Kits, Outfits and Tools (SKOT), providing industrial quality tools with life time warranties, foam cut outs for rapid inventory, and increased ease of accountability and transportability to the warfighter. SKOT Group's broad portfolio includes SKOTs for tracked and wheeled vehicle emergency repair and maintenance, armament systems repair, hydraulic systems repair, metal working and machining, cutting and welding, engineering and construction, urban operations, Army diving mission, inflatable boats and motors, and fire suppression and protection equipment.</p>
<p>Interested sources are challenged to provide the most cost-effective approach that meets the following overall objectives:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Providing vendor-consigned inventory (stock) to GSA for resale/distribution to its RIA-JMTC and SKOT GROUP customers. Each vendor, for their product category or categories, will be required to consign stock to GSA; ownership of the vendor-consigned inventory (VCI) will be passed to GSA when the stock is requisitioned by its RIA-JMTC and SKOT GROUP customers through GSA's Point of Sale (POS) system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Maintain min/max VCI levels, source new products in its assigned category or categories, and provide Just-in-Time (JIT) delivery for products not stocked on-site.&nbsp; As the VCI drops to the minimum level, GSA will place an order via GSA's POS to the vendor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;GSA along with its government customers will provide individual storage areas for stocking of required products by each vendor.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;All vendors will communicate with GSA through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).&nbsp; As the stock levels in the automated Point of Use (POU), non-automated storage areas or cribs, and POU equipment containing trays or bins for distribution of materials drop to the minimum level, GSA will place an order via GSA's POS to the vendor for their product category.&nbsp; GSA, along with its government customers, will provide individual storage areas for stocking of required products by each vendor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Vendors can win one or multiple product categories; each category of product will be delivered to the 4PL location on Rock Island Arsenal for delivery to RIA-JMTC and SKOT GROUP.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p>NOTICE: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought to determine capability of potential sources and is for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Services (FAS), Office of General Supplies &amp; Services (GSS), Retail Operations branch requires a comprehensive range of commonly purchased industrial products and office supplies for its Government-operated GSA Global Supply Stores located on U.S. Air Base Kadena (Kadena AB)in Okinawa, Japan; U.S. Army Garrison Camp Zama (USAG Camp Zama), U.S. Air Base Misawa (Misawa AB), and U.S. Air Base Yokota (Yokota AB)Iwakuni; Osan and Kunsan Air Bases in Korea; and Camp Lemonier in Djibouti, Africa (Djibouti). Under GSA's 4th Party Logistics (4PL) program, Retail Operations is responsible for managing the resources, capabilities, and technology of its own organization, with support from its product and service providers, to deliver a comprehensive supply chain solution along with its requisitioning capabilities to Government customers. GSA Retail Operations 4PL solution provides more favorable product pricing, an increased breadth of products, as well as standardized ordering, packaging, documentation, and billing.</p>
<p>Through the BPAs, vendors will provide GSA with commercial consigned inventory to support GSA's Global Supply Store operations. Essentially, that means that while the products are on the store shelves, they will be entrusted to GSA (are under the control and custody of GSA) in the storefronts although they are still owned by the vendors, vendor-owned/consigned inventory (VCI). GSA will not own the item until it is requisitioned and processed through GSA's Point of Sale (POS) system. At that point the item is sold to GSA and can be requisitioned by the customer in the GSA Global Supply stores.<br /><br />This Sources Sought is issued for information and planning purposes only. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this Sources Sought. GSA will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this request.</p>
<p>This notice is an announcement that GSA is seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the products and services as described herein. GSA is currently conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources. The information requested by this Sources Sought will be used by GSA to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. However, respondents submitting business information pursuant to this Sources Sought should consult 41 C.F.R., part 105-60 and other implementing regulations concerning the release of such information to third parties under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). All information submitted by respondents that they consider confidential and not releasable to third parties outside of GSA, its employees, agents, consultants, and representatives, must be clearly and conspicuously so marked.</p>
<p>Statement of Objectives</p>
<p>GSA Retail Operations is seeking potential sources that are interested in or have the ability to provide office supplies on consignment to GSA through direct delivery in support of GSA's Global Supply and Retail storefronts located in Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>Under the office supply BPA, the vendor will provide GSA and its customers with office type supplies that may include, but not limited to: basic office supplies; paper products; office appliances; office equipment; office furnishings; housekeeping supplies; computer accessories; office machines; and audio/visual supplies and equipment.</p>
<p>These products represent the bulk of the buying activity at the GSA Retail Stores located in Japan, Korea, and Africa.</p>
<p>Interested sources are challenged to provide the most cost-effective approach that meets the following overall objectives:</p>
<p>1. Providing vendor-consigned inventory (stock) to GSA for resale to customers in its Japan and Korean stores. The vendor, for their product category, will be required to consign stock to GSA; ownership of the vendor-consigned inventory (VCI) will be passed to GSA when the stock is requisitioned by its store customers and the transaction is processed through GSA's POS system.</p>
<p>2. Of particular interest to the Government is the interested vendors' ability to deliver to Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) location versus a CONUS location, including such issues as supply chain transportation/shipping and distribution methods and practices, and replenishment and maintaining stock levels in an OCONUS Brick &amp; Mortar store environment.</p>
<p>3. Maintain min/max VCI levels, source new products in its assigned category, and provide delivery for products not stocked on-site. As the VCI drops to the minimum level, GSA will place an order via GSA's POS to the vendor.</p>
<p>4. GSA will provide individual storage areas for stocking of required products by each vendor.</p>
<p>5. All vendors will communicate with GSA through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).</p>
<p><br />GSA intends to establish a single Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for products to fill requisition orders for office supplies.</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes for office supplies are 322230 (size standard 750 employees) and 339940 (size standard 750). The Government requests that all interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify their small or large business status to the identified or proposed NAICS code.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: .5in .75in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The NIR is the communication point for the Unmanned Mission Control System (UMCS) to include both internal and external connectivity. The NIR provides the IP protocol connections for Command and Control (C2) data, voice communications to external Air Vehicle Operators (AVOs), voice communications for Voice Truck and collection of data from the air vehicle. When used within the UMCS on an aircraft carrier (CVN), the NIR provides connections into the CVN Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services (CANES), and Aviation Data Management and Control System (ADMACS). The NIR provides layer three routing into CVN systems and provides a cyber-security level of protection for the UMCS. The NIR is a component of shore based UMCS implementations and serves as the connection between the UMCS and terrestrial networks. The flexibility of the NIR allows the UMCS to adapt to the land base infrastructure with minimal configuration changes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: .5in .75in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The NIR provides the backbone within the UMCS allowing the communication of C2 and mission level data from the AVO workstation to vehicle. The design is fully redundant in both network connections and power. The NIR will provide the conduit for the Voice over IP (VOIP) messages across the network or to the vehicle for relay to an end user. The NIR is a network connection into the integrated communication system which allows an AVO the ability to communicate with another AVO, mission personnel, Air Traffic Controller or mission analyst. </span></p>

<p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government from an ultimate acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. Requests for solicitation will not receive a response. <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: ">All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government, including any follow up information. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any input as a result of this market survey. The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey.<br /></span><br />The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division is seeking potential sources and pricing for the development and validation of a custom battery for use in the Universal Water Activated Release System (UWARS).&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Universal Water Activated Release System (UWARS) functions to provide attachment of the aircrew member's manual parachute release to the parachute assembly during flight operations, emergency egress, and parachute descent. It will automatically separate an aircrew member from the parachute canopy upon immersion into seawater. This function serves as a backup to the normal method of manually disconnecting the parachute from the aircrew member.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UWARS unit currently utilizes a stack of four CR-1220 lithium/manganese dioxide button cell batteries to power the Built-in-Test (BIT) circuit and to power the firing circuit. The primary objective is to identify and qualify a source for a custom battery that is suitable to the electrical characteristics of the UWARS unit and can tolerate the temperature/environmental conditions that the UWARS unit experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submission Requirements:</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: ">All interested sources shall provide in their submission the tasks to be performed to demonstrate their battery design meets the objectives and requirements defined in the Statement of Objectives. Included in the submission will be rough order of magnitude costs and schedule associated with each task.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Title: World Wide Operations &amp; Maintenance IDIQ Contract<br />Solicitation Number: SAQMMA17R0022<br />Agency: U.S. Department of State<br />Office: Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations<br />Location: Worldwide<br />Notice Type: Sources Sought<br />NAICS Code(s): 221122, 335129, 238210, 238220, 221310, 922160, 221320, 333921, 238160 and 236220
<p>1.0 Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought (SS) is to accomplish market research pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 10, and to identify small businesses capable of and interested in performing the functions described herein. The Department of State (DoS) is requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of attracting small businesses with proven technical capability and experience in the following area:</p>
<p>&bull; Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) Support Overseas</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all management, supervision, administrative support, labor, logistics, training, transportation, materials, supplies, repair parts, tools and equipment to provide O&amp;M and other facilities related services for specified DoS properties. The DoS requires a variety of O&amp;M and technical support services including, but not limited to: <br /><br />&bull; Electrical Generation and Distribution (Medium and Low Voltage)<br />&bull; Interior and Exterior Lighting<br />&bull; Power Monitoring System<br />&bull; Heating Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)<br />&bull; Building Automation Systems/Power Monitoring System <br />&bull; Water Supply, Purification and Distribution <br />&bull; Sanitary Sewer and Waste Water Treatment <br />&bull; Fire Protection and Life Safety <br />&bull; Commercial Kitchen Extinguishing Equipment <br />&bull; Elevator Maintenance <br />&bull; Fuel Storage and Distribution <br />&bull; Roofing and Waterproofing Systems<br />&bull; Building envelope/structure, windows, doors, etc.</p>
<p>This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment on the part of DoS to conduct a solicitation for the services listed below in the future. Respondents are advised that the DoS will not pay for information submitted in response to this SS, nor will it compensate respondents for any costs incurred in the development/furnishing of a response. DoS will not entertain telephone calls or questions for this SS. Note that a decision not to submit a response to this SS will not preclude a vendor from participating in any future solicitation(s).</p>
<p>Responses are limited to those companies considered small business under the following NAICS Codes: 221122, 335129, 238210, 238220, 221310, 922160, 221320, 333921, 238160 and 236220. Respondents are welcome to submit other relevant and appropriate NAICS codes for consideration.</p>
<p>2.0 Statement of Need and Vision</p>
<p>The DoS seeks to engage multiple small businesses in the provisioning of services as prime contractors to help DoS meet its small business goals. DoS have long term, recurring needs for O&amp;M support at various locations around the world.</p>
<p>The Office of Acquisitions, Logistics Management (A/LM) currently supports Overseas Base Operations (OBO) with Post-specific contracts that preclude DoS from realizing economies of scale and efficiencies that would result from World-Wide contracting activities based on long-term public-private partnerships. While one company could support the needs of an entire region, there are opportunities for efficiencies in contract management and contract execution that can be gained by implementing a broader approach.</p>
<p>The issues that plague facilities around the world allows OBO to be creative and flexible in operations and preventative contract management and types to meet the current and projected needs of DoS as it supports our Foreign Service Diplomats, Embassies, and other U.S. Government agencies. Additionally, DoS has seen more Embassies needing to rely on contractor services to support their missions. OBO, in coordination with A/LM has established the following objectives to guide and be achieved through this acquisition:</p>
<p>&bull; Establish a new multi-award, Indefinite-Delivery; Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for O&amp;M services that can support the identified Posts and other DoS facilities world-wide.</p>
<p>&bull; Awarding to multiple small businesses (10-12) under various NAICS codes, will ensure a list of contractors are familiar with DoS operations and programs, while supporting small business goals. The base IDIQ contract will require a Top Secret Facility Clearance. This will limit competition to U.S. offerors. However, offerors may include regional non-U.S. or local companies as part of their solution.</p>
<p>&bull; By awarding a multi-award contract, DoS will benefit from continuous competitive actions that should ensure cost savings during the life of the program.</p>
<p>&bull; The new contract is intended to address unmitigated risks on: existing O&amp;M contracts and to facilitate early transition away from previously awarded contracts with option years remaining; be available for new requirements, and; be a ready-solution for expiring contracts.</p>
<p>&bull; The new contract(s) shall be scoped to improve the relatively narrow scope definitions found in existing contracts. By having such a contract in place, the solicitation process will require a much shorter timeframe to solicit and award contracts. Furthermore, it will allow for a core team of acquisition experts readily familiar with preventative maintenance and/or operational contracting.</p>
<p>&bull; This contract will focus on O&amp;M support services. This contract is not designed to take over General Services Office (GSO) programs, but may be used in lieu of GSO contracts.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Individual task orders awarded under the IDIQ will be limited in scope, dependent upon the needs of the Mission or Post. The actual awards will rely on scope and size of engagement, and be determined at the task order level.</p>
<p>&bull; Contract types (fixed-price, cost-reimbursement, labor-hour, and time-and-materials) for individual task orders and specific requirements will fall under one or more of the following, depending on size and complexity of the facilities, (i.e. NEC, SED, legacy, etc.).</p>
<p>&bull; In order to maximize performance, innovation and competition, task orders will utilize the Performance-Based Services Acquisition (PBSA) strategy. The goal of which is to gain greater access to technological innovations and obtain the best technical solution while achieving savings and efficiencies.</p>
<p>3.0 Scope of Work/Required Capabilities</p>
<p>This acquisition initiative is being led by OBO, Office of Facility Management the mission of which is to "provide global support in operating, managing, and maintaining DoS facilities overseas.

<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI)<br />W912HQ-17-SN-0001<br />Navigation Data and Systems:<br />Analytical and Professional Support Services</p>
<p><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS (USACE), INSTITUTE FOR WATER RESOURCES (IWR) IN ALEXANDRIA, VA.</p>
<p>This announcement is made by the US Army Corps of Engineer's Humphreys' Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA), the IWR's cognizant Contracting Office, and is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the Government's needs with regard to the planned execution of a Navigation Data and Systems Analytical and Professional Support Services contract. It is anticipated that this effort will result in the award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple-Award Task Order (MATOC) contract with a Base Year plus four (4) Option Years. The estimated price ceiling for this requirement is approximately $48M.</p>
<p>The Institute for Water Resources (IWR) was formed 47 years ago to provide the USACE Civil Works Program with the capability to analyze and anticipate emerging Navigation trends and issues facing our nation. From its beginnings, one of the core missions of IWR has been to support the Corps Navigation program, including both deep and shallow draft coastal and inland systems in the United States and worldwide. Navigation is the largest Corps Business Line, in terms of value, representing about 45 percent of the Corps Civil Works budget. IWR has been tackling the Navigation data and systems challenges coming from an ever increasing demand for products and services transported by water. As such, there remains a compelling need for analytical and professional support to pursue innovative approaches to solving these new problems. IWR is a Field Operating Activity (FOA) under the supervision and direction of the Deputy Commanding General for Civil and Emergency Operations (DCG-CEO) and Director of Civil Works (DCW) for USACE. IWR's challenging mission remains integral to shaping the evolution of Federal Navigation policy as decision-makers at all levels within USACE look to IWR for insights into a host of complex physical, economic, environmental and social issues.</p>
<p>HECSA is seeking information on companies that have the capability to provide technical and analytical support services for the Institute for Water Resources that is generally not available within the USACE. The scope of this effort is intended to encompass all aspects of the Civil Works Navigation mission area and other mission areas that connect with Navigation (including Flood Risk Management, Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration, Hydropower, Regulatory, Recreation, and Water Supply, etc.) as well as support to this USACE mission.</p>
<p>The primary contractor support services required are in the following performance area requirements (functional areas):</p>
<p>1. Navigation Studies and Assessments (PWS Part 3.1)<br />2. Navigation Decision Support Systems and Tools (PWS Part 3.2)<br />3. Navigation Data, Collection and Analytical Methodologies, Tools, and Models (PWS Part 3.3)<br />4. Navigation Outreach, and Training Services (PWS Part 3.4)<br />5. Decision Support, Analyses, and Assessments (PWS Part 3.5)<br />6. Future Directions Assessments (PWS Part 3.5)</p>
<p>The level of support required varies by each task order, however, in many cases future task orders will require an integration of expertise from a wide variety of these functional areas.</p>
<p>USACE is requesting two (2) specific areas of information be supplied by interested vendors:</p>
<p>1. Comments and Suggestions for the Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) which has been uploaded as Attachment # 1.</p>
<p>2. Capability Statements in response to this RFI, which should include as a minimum the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) A description of the capabilities that demonstrate the interested firm's ability to <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; support the multiple functional areas listed above, [limit 3 pages]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) A description of company history with regard to (a) how multidisciplinary&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experience was obtained or developed and (b) types and/or combination of types of <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; awarded contract vehicles (e.g. Cost Reimbursement, IDIQ, Fixed Price, Fixed Price <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Level of Effort, Time &amp; Materials, etc.). Please submit contract numbers for any <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; completed/in-progress contract of similar work.[limit 10 pages];</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) A description of the degree of teaming needed to meet the requirements listed <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; above, including an estimated percentage of subcontracted partners[limit 1 page];</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Brief discussion of Key Personnel and their experience with the functional areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Identify whether you are a small or large business with regard to the North <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541618.</p>
<p><br />This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a solicitation, is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the capability statements received. No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be posted at the FedBizOpps website. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any synopsis or solicitation that may result from this market research. Information collected through this announcement will be reviewed by individuals from the US Army Corps of Engineers. Capability statements shall be limited to no more than&nbsp;fifteen pages and sent directly to: Richard.j.pecoraro@usace.army.mil with a copy to Darrell.l.nolton@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>Request for Information 
Security Labeling Service
TAC Number:  TAC-17-38415

This is a request for information (RFI) only.  Do not submit a TEP.  It is requested that all contractors interested in participating in this effort please note their interest and provide indication of their respective capabilities to perform the effort described in attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).   

This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered an Invitation for Bid, Request for Task Execution Plan, Request for Quotation or a Request for Proposal.  Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the VA in developing its acquisition strategy and PWS.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.

Be advised that set-aside decisions may be made based on the information provided in response to this RFI.  Responses should be as complete and informative as possible.

Background
Veterans Health Administration has a need for an HL7 conformant security labeling as a service to support its health care mission. The SLS would include the capability to automatically label health care information so as to distinguish those Veterans who have 38 USC 7332 protected conditions from those that do not. This service would facilitate information sharing by eliminating the need to require authorizations for the majority population who do not actually have 38 USC 7332 protected conditions prior to a disclosure.
  
The scope of work is principally described as an HL7 conformant security labeling service that accepts VA provided healthcare information as input, leverages contractor managed rule-based heuristics to apply all applicable VA identified Laws, Regulations and Policies including HL7 conformant labels to each information element and section up to and including overall high-water mark, and which then returns the final labeled information as output.  

In addition, the scope of work includes ongoing self-evaluation and quality reporting, manual review for indeterminate cases, and a continuing process of adaptation as information codes and classification rules evolve.

The scope of work is more fully described in the accompanying PWS.

Be advised that set-aside decisions may be made based on the information provided in response to this RFI.  Responses should be as complete and informative as possible.
It is requested that the T4NG prime contractors respond to the following questions:

Provide a summary of your technical capability to meet the requirements.  
The page limit for responses is 15 pages.

Small businesses should also include information as to:

the intent and ability to meet set-aside requirements for performance of this effort, if applicable
information as to available personnel and financial resources
Information as to proposed team members, the percentage of work each is to perform and which PWS requirements are planned to be subcontracted
SDVOSBs must indicate whether at least 50% of the cost of labor is planned to be expended for prime employees or employees of other eligible SDVOSB firms. This should also include the prime planned percentage and if under 50%, the names of the potential team members that may be used to fulfill the 50% SDVOSB requirement. 

Technical Approach

Provide a summary of your technical approach to meet the requirements set forth in the PWS including the solution architecture and integration into VA operations.
Does your solution have varying levels of service (add on features) not covered in the PWS?  If so please elaborate.

Performance

Please provide your expected minimum, maximum and average round trip time to label a document based on the volumes identified in the PWS. Please state any assumptions made (e.g. size and type of documents.)
Do you currently measure these metrics? 
Please provide your expectations for the rate of false positives and false negatives. Please describe your methods for measuring these rates. What are your minimum standards for false negative rates and false positive rates? 

Labeling Service

Describe the service capabilities addressing the ability to redefine sensitivity rules, the ability to process and methods for identify, processing and disposing of documents that cannot be labeled.

Does your solution fully support these document types?

<DESC>The SD2 program aims to develop data-driven methods to accelerate scientific discovery and robust design in domains that lack complete models. Engineers regularly use high-fidelity simulations to create robust designs in complex domains such as aeronautics, automobiles, and integrated circuits. In contrast, robust design remains elusive in domains such as synthetic biology, neuro-computation, cyber, and polymer chemistry due to the lack of high-fidelity models. SD2 will develop tools to enable robust design despite the lack of complete scientific models.

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a method of processing data from Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS) measurements that improves upon existing methods. This method is simpler, more accurate, faster and less expensive than previous methods. It uses less hardware and can be used with all wavelengths. In conventional measurements, a reference laser signal runs through the device and is guided to a separate detector and triggers capture of the spectral signal. This old method restricts usable wavelengths to less than half the frequency of the laser. As part of a modification that does away with this limitation, a mirror slides along the device at a constant speed during the scan. Unavoidable velocity variations require linearization or resampling with respect to a known reference for which a metrology laser is employed. The laser is guided as before but the signal is sent to a different detector where the timing information is stored and used to mathematically velocity-correct the original signal in post processing. The problem with this approach is that extra hardware, post processing and tuning are required, and the process can be somewhat difficult to perform. This method digitizes the laser signal in a separate channel along with spectra data, which eliminates the hardware required in previous methods and then demodulates the laser signal with a synthetic quadrature phase detector combined with phase tracking to derive the proper slide position for each data point. This method only requires inexpensive 24 bit audio digitizers, rather than the more expensive event counters of the previous method. The new method does not require tuning, and high resolution data can be obtained at any wavelength. &nbsp; NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. US Patent 8,693,002.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed fluorinated alkyl ether containing epoxies designed as an anti-insect coating. The robust and durable coating was developed to improve aircraft efficiency, but the coating could be useful in a variety of applications where reduction of insect residue adherence is desirable, such as in automotive and wind energy industries. This technology is a copolymeric epoxy coating that is loaded with a fluorinated aliphatic chemical species and nano- to micro-scale particle fillers. The coating was developed as a hydrophobic and non-wetting coating for aerodynamic surfaces to prevent accumulation of insect strike remains that can lead to natural laminar flow disruption and aerodynamic inefficiencies. The coating achieves hydrophobicity in two ways. First, the fluorinated aliphatic chemical species are hydrophobic surface modification additives that preferentially migrate to the polymer surface that is exposed to air. Secondly, the incorporation of particle fillers produces a micro-textured surface that displays excellent resistance to wetting. Combined, these two factors increase hydrophobicity and can also be used to readily generate superhydrophobic surfaces. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially.

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a method to reduce insect adhesion on metallic substrates, polymeric materials, engineering plastics, and other surfaces. The method topographically modifies a surface using laser ablation patterning followed by chemical modification of the surface. This innovation was originally developed to enhance aircraft laminar flow by preventing insect residue buildup, but the method provides a permanent solution for any application requiring insect adhesion mitigation as well as adhesion prevention of other typical environmental contaminants. The technology is a method of mitigating insect residue adhesion to various surfaces upon insect impact. The process involves topographical modification of the surface using laser ablation patterning followed by chemical modification or particulate inclusion in a polymeric matrix. Laser ablation patterning is performed by a commercially available laser system and the chemical spray deposition is composed of nanometer sized silica particles with a hydrophobic solution (e.g. heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrodecyltriethoxysilane) in an aqueous ethanol solution. Both topographic and chemical modification of the substrate is necessary to achieve the desired performance. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. US Patent pending.</p>

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE</strong></div>
<br />
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The National Assessment Governing Board intends to award a sole source contract to the Council of the Great City Schools (CGCS) in accordance with the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>The Council of the Great City Schools is the only national organization exclusively representing the needs of urban public schools. Composed of 68 large city school districts, CGCS's mission is to promote the cause of urban schools and to advocate for inner-city students through a variety of activities, including providing a network for school districts sharing common problems to exchange information, and to collectively address new challenges as they emerge in order to deliver the best possible education for urban youth. CGCS was instrumental in the creation and congressional support for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA) program as well as the recruitment of volunteer districts to participate in the program. TUDA provides the nation with a way to measure progress within and compare across large urban districts in the country. The majority of the 27 large urban districts that voluntarily participate in TUDA are also members of CGCS.  Therefore, coordination with these CGCS members would provide unique local perspectives on education matters which are essential for making informed policy decisions related to The Nation's Report Card and for carrying out the Board's congressional-mandated responsibilities under the requirements of Public Law 107-279. More information on the work of the National Assessment Governing Board can be found at www.nagb.gov.</p>
<p>This notice is being posted under the requirements of FAR Subpart 6.3 - Other Than Full and Open Competition. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A formal solicitation will not be issued. The procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition in or around January 2017. The contract period of performance will include a base year as well as 2 option years, for a maximum duration of 36 months.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB or Governing Board) has a congressional mandate to set policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress - also known as The Nation's Report Card - and to take appropriate actions that improve the form, content, use, and reporting of assessment results. The Governing Board also has responsibility to plan and execute the initial public release of NAEP reports. A key component in providing feedback on the Governing Board's work and disseminating NAEP is through expanded outreach activities with targeted audiences across the nation. As increased attention is drawn to NAEP, particularly with the Common Core State Standards, it is important to encourage and expand the involvement of state policymakers and educators in providing information and input to the Governing Board in executing its congressionally mandated responsibilities. As a continuing component of its policy making and outreach activities, the Governing Board seeks input from state stakeholders who are keenly interested in NAEP.</p>
<p><strong>Task Force Collaboratio</strong>n</p>
<p>This sole source award would result in the establishment of a TUDA Task Force in 2017. The Task Force would be composed of high-level staff of urban districts that are members of both CGCS and participate in TUDA. The joint work will involve discussions on current issues relevant to urban districts and NAEP. The goal of this collaboration is to seek district level input and feedback to inform the Governing Board's policy decisions and outreach efforts.</p>
<p>The Task Force will conduct its work through webinars and in-person meetings via contract with the Governing Board. A Task Force member will also periodically attend Governing Board meetings report on the Task Force's ongoing work and promote communication between the Governing Board and the Task Force. Project activities of the Task Force will be available to the public via the Board's website. Topics to be discussed by the Task Force will include planning for reporting and communicating the 2017 NAEP TUDA reports; challenges and opportunities with digital-based assessments; input on NAEP's contextual variable data collected through student, teacher, and school questionnaires; and districts' NAEP information use and analysis needs.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity for Comment and Capability Statements</strong></p>
<p>Organizations and persons may identify their interest in and capability to respond to the requirement. Please submit capability statements to anthony.r.white@ed.gov by November 29, 2016. Responses received will be posted via www.fbo.gov. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<CONTACT>Kathy Kinnett, Contract Specialist, Email kathy.j.kinnett@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, Alaska District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) on FY17 Design-Build project EIE378, F-35A Aircraft Weather Shelter Sqd #1 at Eielson Airforce Base, Alaska. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of PLAs in connection with large-scale construction projects; (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with the law. Reference: FAR Provision 52.222-33, Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement and Clause 52.222-34, Project Labor Agreement.
<p>In order to assist in the evaluation as to whether the use of a PLA is appropriate for project EIE378, F-35A Aircraft Weather Shelter Sqd #1, Eielson AFB, Alaska, the Alaska District is soliciting information on historical use of PLAs in the Fairbanks area. Any interested party (contractors, project owners, contractor associations, labor unions, construction management firms, etc.) may respond. LETTERS SIMPLY INDICATING SUPPORT FOR OR OPPOSITION TO LABOR UNIONS AND/OR PLAs DO NOT OFFER ANY USEFUL INFORMATION AND WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. Please provide responses to any or all of the following questions:<br /><br />(1) What market share does union labor have in the Fairbanks geographical area?<br />(2) Are any Collective Bargaining Agreements expected to expire between October 2016 and October 2017?<br />(3) Could a PLA contribute to cost savings on the EIE378 project? How?<br />(4) Could a PLA minimize risk to the Government on the EIE378 project? How?<br />(5) Are there ways a PLA would increase costs on the EIE378 project? How?<br />(6) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor in the Fairbanks labor market?<br />(7) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br />(8) Have PLAs been used on private sector construction projects in the Fairbanks geographical area? If so, please provide the following details:<br />A. Project Name and Location<br />B. Project Description<br />C. Project Cost<br />D. Was the project completed on time?<br />E. Number of craft trades present on the project?<br />F. Were there any challenges experienced during the project (delays, investigations, safety issues, labor shortages, management/organizational issues, etc.)?</p>
<p>Please limit your responses to NO MORE THAN TWO (2) PAGES IN LENGTH.</p>
<p>Provide your comments via email to Kathy Kinnett, Contract Specialist, at Kathy.J.Kinnett@usace.army.mil, NO LATER THAN 28 November 2016.</p>

<p>Agency: Department of the Army<br />Office: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />Location: USACE District, Portland<br />Classification Code: Restore original contours and correct porosity in 4 Essayons Rolls-Royce Naval Marine, propeller blades<br />NAICS Code: 332999, All Other Miscellaneous Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: W9127N-17-Q-0009<br />Notice Type: Special Notice <br />Synopsis: This is a special notice prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.2 "Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions"</p>
<p>US Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District intends to award a sole-source, Firm-Fixed Price contract with Rolls-Royce Naval Marine North America Electric, 110 Norfolk St. Walpole, MA 02081. The purpose of this acquisition is to Restore original contours and correct porosity in 4 propeller blades used on the Essayons dredging ship. Services include original engineering manufacturer (OEM) to restore four (4) propeller blades to original specified dimensions and include original Nickel Aluminum Bronze propeller sections and shop materials as required. In 2014, the aforementioned blades were damaged during a grounding incident. The grounding bent the tips of all 4 blades and caused some additional distortion toward the root in each of the blades. These conditions resulted in an approximately 30% loss in efficiency. This condition is not acceptable as it lengthens times for each dredge cycle thus greatly reducing overall efficiency of the program. The blades were removed and need attention before they can be regarded as serviceable spares. The statutory authority for this non-competitive acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b) for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE POSTED. <br />The Government intends to proceed with this sole source action. The NAICS code is 332999. The size standard as defined by the U.S. Small Business Administration is 750.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS. <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Electronic responses and question shall be submitted via email to joshua.d.fellwock@usace.army.mil. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is not responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.</p>

The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions &amp; clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-91 effective 30 September, 2016. The applicable North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 325120 with a size standard of 1,000 employees. <br /><br />FCMDL is responsible for developing new and improved analytical methods for analyzing the components (vitamins, minerals, and primary and secondary metabolites) in the US food supply. High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) is the analytical methodology that is critical to performing these analyses. FCMDL has 9 HPLC-MS in the building. This instrumentation requires a constant supply of nitrogen gas. In 2011, it was determined that FCMDL could save considerable money by going to a central supply and distribution system as opposed to maintaining individual nitrogen tanks in each laboratory. As a result, a reinforced concrete pad was constructed, a bulk nitrogen storage tank (900 gallons) was installed, and a distribution system was constructed with pressure regulator manifolds in 7 labs. FCMDL requires an uninterrupted supply&nbsp;of liquid nitrogren including rental of tank and maintenance (operatiion and repair)&nbsp; of tank.<br /><br />All interested offerors are invited to submit a quote utilizing your most competitive and reasonable rates. ARS will evaluate quotations and issue an award based on best value. <br /><br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: December 1, 2016 through November 30, 2017. <br /><br />PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: <br />USDA, ARS, BHNRC, Food Composition and Methods Development Lab<br />10300 Baltimore Avenue<br />Building 161, BARC-East<br />Beltsville, MD 20795</p>

<p>The Army Contracting Command - Redstone Arsenal intends to award a modification to the existing Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wireless-guided (TOW) Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) contract which will extend the contract period from 1 January 2017 through 31 December 2017. The extension will provide for the continuation of CLS in support of TOW ITAS.</p>
<p>This twelve month extension of services is accomplished pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This twelve month extension is intended to be awarded to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) under FAR 6.302-1 as award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement.</p>

Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be emailed to Michael.r.bell44.civ@mail.mil and Dorphelia.b.foster.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE NOTICE FOR PROCUREMENT ACTION 

Proposal Disallowed Reason:

Project Title: Sonic Telemetry Equipment

This solicitation is being advertised as a noncompetitive sole source solicitation. As provided under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), this project will be solicited on a noncompetitive basis as "Only one source is reasonably available to satisfy the agency's requirements."  

The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award, on a sole source basis, a single firm-fixed price purchase order to Sonotronics, Inc. located in Tucson, AZ.  The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement to purchase several types of ultrasonic transmitters and towable hydrophones. The following are the product item descriptions, salient characteristics, and the quantities Reclamation intends to purchase: 

Purchase fifty-eight (58) ultrasonic transmitters for internal implantation in fish. Transmitters should have a minimum battery life of 9 months, a maximum size of 47 mm long x 11 mm in diameter, a detection range of > 500 meters, and should weigh less than or equal to 4 g in water (Sonotronics IBT-96-9-I). These transmitters will allow researchers to actively or passively track sub-adult fish for the life of the tag, providing researchers the opportunity to determine habitat preferences and movement patterns of rare fish species. Purchase another twenty-five (25) ultrasonic transmitters for internal implantation in fish. Transmitters should have a minimum battery life of 36 months, a maximum size of 63 mm long x 16 mm in diameter, a detection range of > 750 meters and should weigh less than or equal to 10 g in water (Sonotronics CT-05-36-I). These transmitters will allow researchers to actively or passively track adult fish for the life of the tag, providing researchers the opportunity to determine habitat preferences and movement patterns of rare fish species. Additionally, purchase ten (10) ultrasonic transmitters for internal implantation in fish. Transmitters should have a minimum battery life of 90 days, a maximum size of 25 mm long x 9 mm in diameter, a detection range of > 500 meters, and should weigh less than or equal to 2.3 g in water (Sonotronics PT-4). These transmitters will allow researchers to actively or passively track juvenile fish for the life of the tag, providing researchers the opportunity to determine habitat preferences and movement patterns of rare fish species. Lastly, purchase three (3) towable Omni-directional hydrophones (Sonotronics TH-2 or equivalent). Hydrophones must attach to any Sonotronics brand ultrasonic receiver, be capable of functioning while towed at trolling speeds of approximately 5 knots, and have a cable length of at least 50 feet. This minimum cable length is necessary to minimize the interference caused by engine and propeller noise.

Sonotronics, Inc. is the sole source and manufacturer of all Sonotronics receivers, hydrophones, and transmitters.  Due to its proprietary nature, only Sonotronics equipment and software are compatible. 

A Determination to Solicit Sole Source is being prepared in support of this acquisition.

This procurement will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures.  It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order be awarded no later than November 1, 2016.  Questions and other documents maybe submitted to Leslie Dieguez via e-mail to ldieguez@usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334513 and the size standard is 750 employees.

The contract award information will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (FBO) at (www.fbo.gov).

<p><strong>Note to the Proposed Contractor:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Security Clearance<br /></strong>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the IHS (Indian Health Service). Before starting work requiring routine access to IHS facilities or systems each person must complete an FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an IHS employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for IHS processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an IHS site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of IHS sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The IHS utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the eQIP entry to the OPM (Office of Personnel Management) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the Service Unit for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>OIG Exclusion List<br /></strong>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>

<p>Addenda to FAR 52.212-4 are as follows:</p>
<p>1852.215-84 OMBUDSMAN. (NOV 2011)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this<br />acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source<br />of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the<br />ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or<br />the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with an ombudsman,<br />interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or<br />recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.</p>
<p>(b) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the<br />installation ombudsman, whose name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and email<br />address may be found at: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html. Concerns,<br />issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may<br />be referred to the Agency ombudsman identified at the above URL. Please do not contact the<br />ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical<br />requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer or as specified<br />elsewhere in this document.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.3 1852.223-72 SAFETY AND HEALTH (SHORT FORM). (JUL 2015)<br />(a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational<br />illness; damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. NASA is<br />committed to protecting the safety and health of the public, our team members, and those<br />assets that the Nation entrusts to the Agency.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall have a documented, comprehensive and effective health and safety<br />program with a proactive process to identify, assess, and control hazards and take all<br />reasonable safety and occupational health measures consistent with standard industry practice<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c) in subcontracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold where work will be conducted completely or partly on Federally-controlled facilities.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.4 1852.225-70 EXPORT LICENSES. (FEB 2000)<br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the<br />International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120 through 130, and the Export<br />Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730 through 799, in the performance of this contract. In the absence of available license exemptions/exceptions, the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of hardware, technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing foreign persons in the performance of this contract, including instances where the work is to be performed on-site at NASA Langley Research Center, where the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technical data or software.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the use of licenses and license exemptions/exceptions.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the provisions of this clause apply to its subcontractors.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.5 1852.237-73 RELEASE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION. (JUN 2005)<br />(a) As used in this clause, "sensitive information" refers to information, not currently in the public domain, that the Contractor has developed at private expense, that may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and that may be sensitive or privileged.</p>
<p>(b) In accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies heavily on the support of various service providers. To support NASA activities and functions, these service providers, as well as their subcontractors and their individual employees, may need access to sensitive information submitted by the Contractor under this contract. By submitting this proposal or performing this contract, the Contractor agrees that NASA may release to its service providers, their subcontractors, and their individual employees, sensitive information submitted during the course of this procurement, subject to the enumerated protections mandated by the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information.</p>
<p>(c)(1) The Contractor shall identify any sensitive information submitted in support of this proposal or in performing this contract. For purposes of identifying sensitive information, the<br />Contractor may, in addition to any other notice or legend otherwise required, use a notice similar to the following:</p>
<p>Mark the title page with the following legend:</p>
<p>This proposal or document includes sensitive information that NASA shall not disclose outside the Agency and its service providers that support management activities and administrative functions. To gain access to this sensitive information, a service provider's contract must contain the clause at NFS 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. Consistent with this clause,<br />the service provider shall not duplicate, use, or disclose the information in whole or in part for any purpose other than to perform the services specified in its contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use this information if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The information subject to this restriction is contained in pages (insert page numbers or other identification of pages).</p>
<p>Mark each page of sensitive information the Contractor wishes to restrict with the following<br />legend:</p>
<p>Use or disclosure of sensitive information contained on this page is subject to the restriction on<br />the title page of this proposal or document.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the facts supporting any claim that particular<br />information is "sensitive." This evaluation shall consider the time and resources necessary to<br />protect the information in accordance with the detailed safeguards mandated by the clause at<br />1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. However, unless the Contracting Officer decides,<br />with the advice of Center counsel, that reasonable grounds exist to challenge the Contractor's<br />claim that particular information is sensitive, NASA and its service providers and their<br />employees shall comply with all of the safeguards contained in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(d) To receive access to sensitive information needed to assist NASA in accomplishing<br />management activities and administrative functions, the service provider must be operating<br />under a contract that contains the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. This<br />clause obligates the service provider to do the following:</p>
<p>(1) Comply with all specified procedures and obligations, including the Organizational Conflicts<br />of Interest Avoidance Plan, which the contract has incorporated as a compliance document.</p>
<p>(2) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession only for the purpose of<br />performing the services specified in its contract.</p>
<p>(3) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from unauthorized use and<br />disclosure.</p>
<p>(4) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees that need it to perform<br />services under its contract.</p>
<p>(5) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to persons and entities outside of<br />the service provider's organization.</p>
<p>(6) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information about their obligations to<br />utilize it only to perform the services specified in its contract and to safeguard it from<br />unauthorized use and disclosure.</p>
<p>(7) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has received and will comply<br />with training on the authorized uses and mandatory protections of sensitive information needed<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(8) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply with all reasonable<br />security procedures, report any breaches to the Contracting Officer, and implement any<br />necessary corrective actions.</p>
<p>(e) When the service provider will have primary responsibility for operating an information<br />technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the service provider's contract<br />shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information<br />Technology Resources. The Security Requirements clause requires the service provider to<br />implement an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or<br />transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use. Service provider personnel<br />requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to these information technology systems<br />are subject to screening using the standard National Agency Check (NAC) forms appropriate to<br />the level of risk for adverse impact to NASA missions. The Contracting Officer may allow the<br />service provider to conduct its own screening, provided the service provider employs<br />substantially equivalent screening procedures.</p>
<p>(f) This clause does not affect NASA's responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (g), suitably modified to<br />reflect the relationship of the parties, in all subcontracts that may require the furnishing of<br />sensitive information.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

<p>Acceptance of Medical Care by Civilians: By law, any Soldier that is hurt on the job during this event is entitled to Workers Compensation by requesting an LOD packet from the individual soldier that is injured on the job. You cannot sue your employer for your injury and damages; your only remedy is your workers' compensation claim. This is a "trade off" in the law: you do not have to show your employer was at fault, but, in exchange, the only remedy available to you is a workers' compensation claim. HOWEVER, if your injury was caused by someone other than your employer (for example, a defective product or a person working for someone other than your employer) you may have a "third party" case against someone other than your employer. All claims shall be billed using this process using the formal Line of Duty (LOD) action and processed using the soldier's respective unit.</p>

<p>Refusal of Medical Care by Civilians: By law, any non-military person who is alert, oriented, conscious and able to make their own decisions who can refuse medical care. In order to refuse medical care:</p>
<p>1) The individual must not have had any Advanced Life Support (ALS) procedures performed. In cases where ALS procedures have been performed, the patient must be released by a physician. An EMT can gain permission from their on-line medical control to allow a patient to refuse care; otherwise that patient must be transported for evaluation.</p>
<p>2) The appropriate documentation for refusal must be filled out and stored in the patients' record.</p>
<p>3) Refusal of medical care by military members: Military members who are alert, oriented, conscious and able to make their own decisions who desire not be treated or transported will require a consult with the HRF/CERF Commander. After obtaining report from the on scene medical provider, the commander will decide, in accordance with regulations and JAG, the most appropriate course of action for the military member.</p>

<p>A government will monitor contractor performance and complete the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan Worksheet at the end of the contract period of performance. However, the government may submit a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan Worksheet at any time and as often as necessary to document quality levels. If Contractor response to an identified quality deficiency is unsatisfactory, the Contracting Officer will contact the appropriate Contractor representative to implement a plan of action to remedy the identified deficiency.</p>
<p>A quality rating may change from "Green" to "Red" without notice. We anticipate utilizing the "Yellow" quality rating to alert the contracting office of quality issues that have the potential for a "Red" quality rating if corrective action is not taken. If the performance rating for any task in this order is "Red" during any time in the performance period, the COR will notify the Contracting Officer. <br /><br />11. Quality Control (QC): The contractor shall develop and maintain an effective quality control program (QCP) to ensure services are performed in accordance with this PWS. The contractor shall develop and implement procedures to identify, prevent, and ensure non-recurrence of defective services.

<p>CDRL's:</p>
<p>The Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) is a list of authorized data requirements for a specific procurement that forms part of a contract. It is comprised of either a single DD Form 1423, or a series of DD Forms 1423 containing data requirements and delivery information. The CDRL is the standard format for identifying potential data requirements in a solicitation, and deliverable data requirements in a contract. DFAR Subpart 215.470 requires the use of the CDRL in solicitations when the contract will require delivery of data.</p>
<p>DD Form 1423 - Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL)</p>
<p>CDRLs should be linked directly to Statement of Work (SOW) tasks and managed by the Program Management Office (PMO) data manager. Data requirements can also be identified in the contract via Special Contract Clauses (e.g., Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS)), which define special data provisions (such as, Rights in Data, Warranty, etc.).</p>
<p>The purpose of the CDRL is to provide a standardized method of clearly and unambiguously delineating the Government's minimum essential data needs. The CDRL groups all of the data requirements in a single place rather than have them scattered throughout the solicitation or contract</p>

<p>** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.<br />All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1), dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE<br />Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444)</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class (es) of employees (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iv)(C)(vi)). When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage<br />Determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>(s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:</p>
<p>(1) The schedule of supplies/services.<br />(2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause.<br />(3) The clause at 52.212-5.<br />(4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.<br />(5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.<br />(6) Other paragraphs of this clause.<br />(7) The Standard Form 1449.<br />(8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.<br />(9) The specification.</p>
<p>(t) System for Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(iii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.</p>
<p>(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:</p>
<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEVIATION 2013-O0019) (Sep 2016)</p>
<p>(a) Comptroller General Examination of Record.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.



Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-17-Q-200014 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-91 effective 30 September 2016.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.</p>
<p>See attached documents titled: <br />&#61607; "Requirements - HSCG38-17-Q-200014" and<br />&#61607; "Terms and Conditions - HSCG38-17-Q-200014".</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>
<p>NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 31 October 2016 at 4:15 pm EST. Anticipated award date is on or about1 November 2016. E-mail quotations are preferred and may be sent to dawn.b.oconnor@uscg.mil. Please indicate HSCG38-17-Q-200014 in subject line. Quotations may also be mailed to the following address:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

<p>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate the offer:</p>
<p>Factors: <br />1. Past Performance <br />2. Price</p>
<p>Past performance is significantly more important that price.</p>
<p>Factor 1: Past Performance</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a)(2) Past Performance Evaluation. The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following: <br />Past Performance Quality Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Exceptional Performance met contractual requirements and exceeded many to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor was highly effective.<br />Very Good Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.<br />Satisfactory Performance meets contractual requirements. The element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory<br />Marginal Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions<br />Unsatisfactory Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The element being assessed contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.<br />Neutral The offeror has no past performance history OR the Contracting Officer has determined that the past performance information provided is not directly related or similar to the requirements in the RFP.</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. For purposes of this solicitation, "relevant contracts" are defined as contracts performed in the three years preceding the date of this solicitation in which the contractor was the prime contractor performing construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships. Past performance ratings for contracts that were completed more than three years before the date of the issuance of this solicitation are not considered relevant and will not be evaluated. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered. Vendors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will be assigned a Neutral rating.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2: Price</p>
<p>The total evaluated price of the offeror will be determined by totaling the proposed prices of all the Definite Items, plus the composite labor hour extended total, plus lay days, and foreseeable costs.</p>
<p>(1) DEFINITE ITEMS: These are the items, which, if there is an award at all, will be awarded. The bid shall be evaluated to include the price for each definite item.</p>
<p>(2) OPTION ITEMS: These are the items, which, if there is an award at all, may be awarded upon completion of open and inspect, or if additional funds become available, of if they are needed. The offer shall be evaluated to include the price for each option item.</p>
<p>(3) COMPOSITE LABOR HOUR RATE: The offer shall be evaluated to include the offer price for the Composite Labor Hour Rate multiplied by the estimated quantity of hours.</p>
<p>(4) LAY DAYS: A lay day is defined as an additional day on a dry dock or marine railway caused by a Government- issued change. The Contracting Officer will evaluate the daily rate for lay days multiplied by the estimated quantity of lay days as stated in the offeror's Schedule of Services/ Supplies.</p>
<p>(5) FORESEABLE COSTS: The Contracting Officer will evaluate certain foreseeable costs that will vary with the location of the commercial shipyard to be used by bidders/offerors under this solicitation. Costs will be calculated based on the bidder's/offeror's shipyard location and these costs will be added, for the purposes of evaluation only, to the bidder's/offeror's overall price.</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. Price will be determined by adding the value of the estimated quantities for all items in the schedule of prices to include all options. Award may be made without any type of discussions or negotiations. This is based on the Contracting Officer's determination after an evaluation has been completed on all offers.</p>
<p>DISTANCE FACTOR ADJUSTMENT</p>
<p>In accordance with Coast Guard Acquisition Procedures (CGAP) 3017.9001- Price related factors in the award of vessel repair contracts, foreseeable costs in connection with the differences of shipyard locations in the award of any vessel repair contract conducted away from the vessel's home pier shall be evaluated in all solicitations for contracts exceeding $100,000. <br /><br />LOCATION OF OFFEROR'S COMMERCIAL SHIPYARD</p>
<p>In order for the Contracting Officer to evaluate certain foreseeable costs to the Coast Guard that will vary with the location of the commercial shipyard to be used by the offeror, the offeror is required to provide, in the space below, the exact location of the shipyard to be used to perform the services required under this solicitation. The offeror is cautioned that its failure to provide the location of its commercial shipyard in the space provided may result in its quote being declared nonresponsive under the provisions of the terms of this Request for Quote.</p>
<p>Name of Shipyard: ____________________________________________________________</p>
<p><br />FORESEEABLE COST FACTORS PERTAINING TO DIFFERENT SHIPYARD LOCATIONS</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will evaluate certain foreseeable costs to the Coast Guard. Those costs will vary based on the location of the offeror's shipyard and are added to the offeror's overall bid price or price quote for the purposes of evaluation only. These elements of foreseeable costs consist of the following:</p>
<p>(1) Transit Cost: <br />(i) Vessel operational cost will be calculated based on one round trip from the vessel's homeport of Baltimore, MD to the contractor's facility. Distance will be based on the NOAA publication, "Distance Between U.S. Ports" or other authority (in order of priority), including Army Corp of Engineers or U.S. Navy transit publications, if the shipyard location is not contained in the NOAA publication. <br />(ii) Transit cost to navigate the vessel between its homeport and the contractor's offered place of performance is 90.57 per nautical mile. The number of nautical miles to transit between the offerors shipyard and the vessel's homeport will be multiplied by the operational cost.</p>
<p>(2) Family Separation Allowance &amp; Homeport Travel: Crew members with dependents residing within the area of the homeport are entitled to Family Separation Allowance and Homeport Travel Allowance whenever a vessel is overhauled outside of the area of the homeport. The area of the homeport is defined as the area within 50 road miles of the homeport. If the contractor's facility is outside of a 50-road mile radius of the vessel's homeport-</p>
<p>(i) Family Separation Allowance for personnel in accordance with Family Separation Allowance listed under DFAS.mil; Pay &amp; Allowance; Family Separation Allowance for N/A crew members entitled to Family Separation Allowance N/A per day. This entitlement is calculated from the date that the vessel leaves the home port to transit to the offerors shipyard and the planned date of return to home port after completion of repairs or equipment installation.</p>
<p>(ii) Homeport Travel. Crew's transportation during overhaul away from home port. As required by 37 USC 406 b and Chapter 7, Part F1 of the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), on the thirty-first (31) day of a vessel being away from home port, and every sixty (60) days thereafter, all personnel with dependents residing in the area of the home port will be provided round trip coach type airfare to the vessels home port. There will be one (1) home port visit(s) during the performance of this contract. The vessel has zero (0) crew members eligible for Homeport Travel. Airfares will be based on the GSA City Pairs contracted Government YCA Fare (or successor GSA fare source) in effect at the time of receipt of bids/proposals. If there is no GSA contracted rate between the location of the contractor's shipyard and the homeport the rate will be computed based on commercially available airfares.</p>
<p>(3) Travel and Per Diem Costs: If the contractor's facility is outside of a 50-road mile radius of the vessel's homeport-</p>
<p>(i) There will be a transportation cost for one (1) Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for zero (0) round trip(s) between the contractor's offered place of performance and the COR's official duty station at the cost of coach-type airfare. <br />(ii) There will be a per diem expense Five (05) calendar days to support one (1) COR while in the city of the place of contract performance, to be determined in accordance with the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR). The cost of car rental for the estimated performance period will also be included. <br />(iii) There will be a transportation cost for one (1) Contracting Officer for one (1) round trip(s) between the Contracting Officer's official duty station and the contractor's offered place of performance at the cost of coach-type airfare, plus per diem expenses and a rental car.</p>
<p>PRE AWARD SURVEY</p>
<p>Prior to a contract being awarded a Pre-Award Survey may be conducted by the US Coast Guard Quality Assurance Team. The survey is used as an indication if a contractor has the qualifications to do the work and that the contractor's facilities are certified under US Coast Guard specifications. Areas of interest on this survey may include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1. Dry dock certification <br />2. Performance Plans<br />3. Quality control or contractor quality assurance Plans<br />4. Personnel recruitment and training plans<br />5. Workload factors for manpower utilization<br />6. Management plan for handling peak workloads<br />7. Production capability<br />a. Plant facilities and equipment<br />b.

<p>Offerors are advised that accomplishment of this survey is a part of the evaluation process and is not to be construed as an indication that an offeror will receive or is in the best position to receive the resultant award.</p>
<p>b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">USAID&rsquo;s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line;">Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.&nbsp; Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.&nbsp; OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.&nbsp; OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line;">To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office&rsquo;s programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers&rsquo; compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; text-transform: uppercase;">Introduction</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">In line with U.S. foreign policy objectives, the USAID/OTI Cameroon program will work to decrease the impacts of Boko Haram/Islamic State&rsquo;s West Africa Province (ISWAP) in northern Cameroon.&nbsp; Boko Haram/ISWAP threatens to further destabilize the Sahel, West and Central Africa regions, and its links with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) pose a great threat for ungoverned spaces in the region.&nbsp; Recent security gains against Boko Haram/ISWAP are encouraging, but the social fabric in northern Cameroon has been severely strained due to the conflict.&nbsp; USAID/OTI&rsquo;s Cameroon program would help to bolster local efforts to strengthen community cohesion and to further undermine Boko Haram/ISWAP&rsquo;s ability to recruit and operate in Cameroon.&nbsp; The program will work closely with other USAID/OTI programs in the region, to better connect U.S. Government efforts along the Diffa- Maiduguri- Maoura corridor. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The OTI Deputy Country Representative &ndash; Cameroon is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team, and reports to the OTI Country Representative in Cameroon. The Deputy Country Representative&rsquo;s principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of USAID/OTI's Cameroon country program.&nbsp; The incumbent will be called upon to support the OTI Country Representative with managing an implementing partner and may be called upon to represent OTI&rsquo;s program to local partners, senior-level U.S. government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The USAID/OTI Cameroon program will coordinate with, and complement, other USAID/OTI programs in the region, USAID and Department of State assistance efforts, as well as those of other donors.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including stabilization, counterinsurgency, community-driven development, elections, subnational governance, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, and human rights. Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies or managing program operations in civil conflicts is preferred. A strong working knowledge of French is a requirement for this position. Willingness to work alongside military colleagues (both U.S. and non-U.S.) is essential. The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically charged and challenging security environments. Experience in remote project management is highly desirable, as this position is Yaound&eacute;-based yet the programming will be localized in the Extreme North of Cameroon (Maroua).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</span></p>

Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at </span><a href="http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</span></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: blue;">.&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">Note:&nbsp; Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.&nbsp; The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. &nbsp;Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. &ldquo;MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. &nbsp;The primary insurer&rsquo;s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.&nbsp; When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled &ldquo;Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.&rdquo; &nbsp;In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. &nbsp;The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. &nbsp;The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. &nbsp;In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. &nbsp;In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.&nbsp; In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.&nbsp; The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor&rsquo;s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. &nbsp;The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. &nbsp;When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. &nbsp;As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual&rsquo;s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. &nbsp;If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. &nbsp;If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<a name="wp1151849"></a><a name="wp1151850"></a><a name="wp1151853"></a><a name="wp1151855"></a><a name="wp1152029"></a><a name="wp1152039"></a><a name="wp1151859"></a><a name="wp1151861"></a><a name="wp1151863"></a><a name="wp1151865"></a><a name="wp1157350"></a><a name="wp1157352"></a><a name="wp1157382"></a><a name="wp1157391"></a><a name="wp1154102"></a><a name="wp1152123"></a><a name="wp1152132"></a><a name="wp1151875"></a><a name="wp1152149"></a><a name="wp1151879"></a><a name="wp1154117"></a><a name="wp1154123"></a><a name="wp1154125"></a><a name="wp1154150"></a><a name="wp1154156"></a><a name="wp1154119"></a><a name="wp1154165"></a><a name="wp1154186"></a><a name="wp1154169"></a><a name="wp1154171"></a><a name="wp1151905"></a><a name="wp1151907"></a><a name="wp1151909"></a><a name="wp1151911"></a><a name="wp1151913"></a><a name="wp1151915"></a><a name="wp1151917"></a><a name="wp1151919"></a><a name="wp1151921"></a><a name="wp1151923"></a><a name="wp1152315"></a><a name="wp1157413"></a><a name="wp1154279"></a></span></p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.<br />"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;<br />(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;<br />(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and<br />(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".<br />"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-<br />(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;<br />(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and<br />(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.<br />(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database;<br />(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.<br />(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.



Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-17-00356 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception: (i) Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (ii) Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE. (iii) Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically. Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail. Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized. Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

<p>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a&nbsp;RFI seeking information from all potential sources who may be interested in supplying a support platform (ocean-going craft) for an existing Navy-owned autonomous unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV). The support platform must have the capability to transport, launch, and recover the UUV for operations; and husband the UUV for replenishment and routine maintenance. For this assessment, the Navy is primarily interested in the lowest procurement and maintenance cost solutions involving special purpose non self-propelled craft (barges) with semi-submersible platforms (ballasted, gear-driven, hydraulic), synchrolifts, or gantry cranes capable of safely launching and recovering the UUV in up to a Sea State 3. Respondents are requested to provide information concerning estimated procurement price and estimated operations and maintenance costs of the vessels as indicated below.</p>
<p>To reduce the cost of the platform the, the contractor's proposal may include modifying an existing government furnished YON Tank Barge, YC Open Lighter Barge, other available government owned barge, or other contractor provided (non-government furnished) barge.</p>
<p>For purposes of this request only, the Navy is contemplating acquiring one (1) system along with associated test support and first year operational support. As a basis for the response to this request, it should be assumed that the system would be contracted in the Government Fiscal Year (FY) 2018.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:<br /></strong><br />See attached Notional Performance Specification for Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) Support Platform.<br /><br /><strong>RESPONSES:<br /></strong>Responses should be limited to 20 pages or less (not including any drawings, specifications, diagrams, renderings or other documents to demonstrate technical capabilities, respondent's operational support capabilities, or respondent's estimated operational or maintenance cost estimates). A detailed proposal is not requested. Provide as much of the following technical data as practical within the time constraints of this inquiry. If the Respondent has multiple systems that meet the RFI requirements, a separate response should be submitted for each. The following information is requested:</p>
<p>1. Provide drawings, renderings, specifications and/or other technical data or information for a system which is capable of meeting the requirements stated in the attached Notional Performance Specification for Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) Support Platform.<br /><br />2.

If the system has not been previously produced, provide an estimate of the time required to complete design, testing, production, and delivery of the system.<br /><br />3. Provide detailed estimates of the price to design, produce, and deliver the system. Provide a breakdown of estimated costs to operate and maintain the system within the scope described in the attached Notional Performance Specification for Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) Support Platform.</p>

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION:
<p>Project: JBE041 Design-Build Add/Alter AWACS Alert Hangar, JBER, Alaska<br />Notice Type: Pre-Solicitation Notice<br />Solicitation Number: W911KB-17-R-0011<br />Posted Date: 03 October 2016<br />Original Response Date:&nbsp; November 21, 2016 (2:00p.m. Alaska Standard Time)<br />Original Archive Date:<br />Current Archive Date:<br />Classification Code: Y - Construction<br />Set Aside: N/A-Full and open<br />NAICS Code: 236220 Size Standard: $36.5M</p>
<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: This is a pre-solicitation notice for a two-phase, unrestricted Request for Proposal (RFP) for an upgrade to aircraft sheltering and maintenance hangar space as well as repairing and expanding existing squadron operations spaces and constructing missing AWACS alert crew quarters JBER, Alaska (JBE041). Phase 1 RFP will be released on or about 20 October 2016.</p>
<p>The procurement will be conducted using two-phase source selection procedures and the award will be based on the best overall value to the Government considering the non-price factors described in the RFP, and price. The Government will evaluate Phase 1 proposals in accordance with the evaluation rating systems outlined in the Phase 1 Design-Build selection procedures of the RFP. Those offerors short-listed in Phase 1 will be invited to submit a Phase 2 proposal. The Phase 2 evaluation will be conducted in accordance with evaluation criteria specified in the RFP for Phase 2, FAR Part 15, and will utilize the Tradeoff Process described in FAR 15.101-1.</p>
<p>Any resulting contract will be firm fixed price. The anticipated Notice to Proceed date will be second quarter 2017 with a period of performance of 575 calendar days. Offerors are advised that a contract resulting from this solicitation is subject to the availability of funds and may be cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation and final award. Should Congress not appropriate funds, the solicitation will be cancelled. If the project is cancelled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror.</p>
<p>All contractors are advised that they must be registered in the System of Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov/). Joint ventures must also be registered in SAM as a joint venture. We advise contractors to begin this process when they prepare their proposal in order to ensure this registration is in place should they be selected for the award. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award. <br />PROJECT INFORMATION: Design and Construct addition to and alteration of the AWACS alert hangar to accommodate the facility mission. Due to Alaska winter weather and deicing times, alert aircraft must be housed inside to meet mission scramble requirements. To meet alert mission requirements, aircraft maintenance, squadron operations and air crew quarters need to be located in the same facility. An upgrade to aircraft sheltering and maintenance hangar space as well as repairing and expanding existing squadron operations spaces and constructing missing AWACS alert crew quarters space is necessary for the 962nd Airborne Control Squadron (AACS) to fully accomplish its missions. Alsop additional squadron operations space is needed to meet the scheduled AWACS, E-3G upgrade, which requires an additional 12-15 dedicated planning workstations. Sustainability and Energy measures will be provided.<br />Anticipated contract cost limitation is $25,000,000.00.</p>
<p>SELECTION CRITERIA: This acquisition will evaluate offerors considering the following factors:</p>
<p>For Phase 1: Specialized Experience, Past Performance (Confidence Assessment), Organization, and Technical Approach.</p>
<p>For Phase 2: Design Technical (Subfactors: Building Functional and Aesthetics; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule); Small Business Participation; Phase 1 Proposal Roll-Up Rating, and Price.</p>
<p>The overall evaluation of the non-price factors is considered significantly more important than price.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - St. Paul District requires a contractor to mechnically pulverize/chop/mulch above ground assorted species of trees and brush from the side slopes of two Zah Gheeng (ZG) Marsh dikes, located downstream of Red Lake Dam, in Clearwater County, Minnesota, on the Red Lake Indian Reservation. The maximum allowable height for vegetation is 6 inches, though closer to the ground is preferred. The slopes were last mechanically cleared in 2011.<br /><br />The&nbsp;dike on the south side of the river begins immediately downstream of the dam (Hwy 1 Bridge), and extends approximately 3.5 miles downstream. The&nbsp;dike on the north side of the river extends approximately 3.0 miles downstream. Each dike has a maintenance road on top that will allow access&nbsp;for equipment. The side slopes of the dike are approximately 25 to 30 feet from the top of the dike to the waterline. The slopes are steep, slippery, uneven, and vary in slope angle.&nbsp;<br /><br />The work site is entirely on Red Lake Indian Reservation. It will be the contractor's responsibility to determine if permits are required, and to obtain required permits from the Red Lake Tribal Government. <br /><br />All work must be completed by 15 March 2017.

<DESC>This Contract is for the design, fabrication, and installation of Large Scale Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) Blankets for Exploration Missions. This endeavor is part of an effort to improve the fundamental understanding of multilayer insulation (MLI) systems. After the MLI is applied to a SHIIVER Tank, the tank will be tested in a thermal vacuum chamber and in a reverberant acoustic environment. Following the reverberant acoustic testing, thermal vacuum testing will be repeated to determine whether damage to the MLI was caused by acoustic excitation.
<p>Team members include Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center (LMATC) for analysis and guidance in design, and Sheldahl, Inc. for materials.</p>
<p>Option 1 is being performed in conjunction with the Base Period, thus, giving the Contract a fifteen (15) month period of performance.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole-source contract pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i), only one responsible source, which applies when the supplies/services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government intends to negotiate a contract with Bellsouth Communications, Atlanta, GA for Naval Hospital Pensacola, who has a requirement for Ethernet Services. The service provider and equipment manufacturer is Bellsouth Communications, and Navy Medicine is not currently allowing new fibers to be entrenched on site. Bellsouth currently owns the present installation. The current system decreases costs and increased efficiency versus operating and installing additional brands made and supported by other manufacturers. Therefore, Bellsouth Communications is the only known responsible source that can provide what is required for this procurement. See attached Justification and Approval.
<p><br />Vendors who believe they can meet this requirement are required to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the work. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the requirement. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as previously stated.
