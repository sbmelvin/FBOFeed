DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for project number 596-333 that requires Architect/Engineering (A/E) Design Services to  Construct Replacement CLC   Long Term Rehab (CLC Phase 2)  at the Lexington VA Medical Center, Sousley Division, located in Lexington, KY.  

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. ONLY THE A/E FIRMS RESPONDING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BY SUBMITTING AN SF330 PACKAGE ON TIME WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR INITIAL EVALUATION. FOLLOWING INITIAL EVALUATION OF THE A/E FIRMS AND THEIR SF330S,  A SOLICITATION FOR A PRICE PROPOSAL WILL BE SENT TO THE HIGHEST TECHNICALLY RATED A/E FIRM TO PROVIDE THE TYPE OF SERVICE(S) REQUIRED. 

The A/E Services contract that is anticipated to be awarded will be procured in accordance with the Brooks Act (Public Law 92- 582), Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.6 and VA Acquisition Regulation 836.6.  In accordance with FAR 36.209  Construction Contracts With Architect-Engineer Firms , no contract for the construction of a project shall be awarded to the firm that designed the project or its subsidiaries or affiliates, except with the approval of the head of the agency or authorized representative.  
A/E DESIGN SERVICES SCOPE SYNOPSIS:  This project will construct three (3) approximately 11,000 square feet of Continuing Care Facilities and an approximately 29,400 square foot recreation facility.  The Continuing Care Facilities consists of three  Small House  models approximately 11,000 square feet each.  The prototype small house layout was designed in Phase I of this project.  The recreation facility will have to be designed in this project.  The community schematic layout was also designed in Phase I and may be altered slightly during this project.  Phase I of this project ran all infrastructure such as fiber optic cable and copper wire for voice from the main campus to Building 201 of the CLC Community.
The project will also include site utilities, roads, parking, and infrastructure. The new units/houses will be designed using the latest VA Small House Model Design Guide, "Green House," and patient centered care concepts. This project will expand the existing two (2) house Continuing Care community.  This project will validate locations of the new buildings with consideration given to an earlier schematic visualizing an entire Continuing Care community.
