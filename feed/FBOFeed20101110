<DESC><BR>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center - Fort Bragg (MICCC-FB) intends to solicit offers for the Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE) Instructor and Training Support Services requirement.

Evaluation and award of both Suite 1 (100% Small Business Set-Aside) and Suite 2 (Unrestricted, Full and Open) will be based on a negotiated Best Value Trade-Off, with an anticipated selection of four (4) to six (6) contractors under each suite.<BR><BR>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541990 (All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services) and the small business size standard is $7 million.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and award a contract number on a sole source basis to Sikorsky Support Services Inc. to extend current support efforts under USN T-34/44/6 Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) contract number N00019-06-D-0017, which consists of tasking and equipment required for Organization, Intermediate, and Depot-level aircraft maintenance and logistics. The resultant requirements type contract will cover performance up to 7 months (1 April, 2011 - 31 Oct. 2011) or for a period that will be determined at the discretion of the Navy, until the follow on T-34/44/6 CLS contract is awarded under full and open competitive procedures (N00019-10-R-0069).
<p>There are approximately two hundred and seventy-three (273) T-34 aircraft. The T-34 is a single engine, two-place (tandem seat), unpressurized, low-wing, monoplane manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-34 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), FL, Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF), FL, and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC), TX. The T-34 aircraft are also assigned to assorted satellite sites to be used for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) projects, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and as competitive exercise observer platforms at the following satellite sights: NAS Lemoore, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; NAS Oceana, VA; NAF El Centro, CA; ATTC Fort Rucker, AL; Redstone Army Airfield, Huntsville, AL; NAWCAD Patuxent River, MD; Pope AFB Fayetteville, NC; NASA Cleveland, OH; NASA Edwards AFB, CA; and Fort Eustis, VA.</p>
<p>There are approximately fifty-four (54) T-44 aircraft. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are twin-engine, pressurized, fixed-wing, five-place monoplanes manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are identical in airframe and propulsion, but the T-44C avionics have been upgraded to an integrated digital cockpit. The T-44 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC).</p>
<p>There are approximately forty-two (42) T-6A aircraft and twenty (20) T-6B aircraft. The T-6A/B aircraft are single-engine, two-place (tandem seat), pressurized, low-wing, monoplanes manufactured by Hawker Beechcraft Corporation. Both aircraft are powered by a PT6A-68 free turbine turboprop engine, flat rated at 1100 shp, manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. Each aircraft is equipped with two Martin-Baker US16LA ejection seats and On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS). The T-6 is the replacement aircraft for the T-34C. The T-6 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF) and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC). The T-6 aircraft are also assigned to satellite sites (noted above for T-34), to be used for RDT&amp;E, production integration testing, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and competitive exercise observer platforms.</p>
<p>NAVAIR intends to award this T-34/44/6 CLS effort to Sikorsky Support Services Inc. of Pensacola, Fl, under the authority of FAR 6.302 (only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements). To mitigate the possible risk that the competitive follow on contract will not be awarded by 31 March 2011, award of a sole source contract to the current performing contractor is necessary in order to continue to meet CNATRA's training mission. A gap of CLS support would result in a negative impact to Naval Aviation readiness.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to solicit, on a Sole Source basis, Engenium Technologies Corporation (ETC), to provide the systems engineering support required for existing ETC radio and ground station during at-sea testing of an on-going Office of Naval Research (ONR) sponsored project.  ETC designed and fabricated the radios, signal processing, and ground stations that were selected by ONR for use on this project.  No other company can provide the required systems engineering support during this system test of this ONR project, since the design of the equipment is proprietary to ETC and the government does not have rights to the technical data that would be required to provide the support.
  Services will be performed on site at the location of testing.  NAICS CODE IS 541330.  Small Business Size Standard is $27M.  FSC is R425.

<CONTACT>Annette Niedermier

<a href="mailto:Niedermier.Annette@epa.gov">niedermier.annette@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. EPA requires a commercially available ?off-the-shelf? of a Fourier Infrared Transform Spectrometer (FTIR) Zero Air Monitor, with installation and commissioning.  A variety of emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines as part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments. The EPA National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) has the responsibility for testing vehicles and engines to ensure compliance with these regulations. As part of that testing, NVFEL uses high purity gases that need to be monitored to ensure compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations specifications for vehicle testing.  The EPA seeks to purchase a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer to monitor and quantitate impurities in the purified air system.  The instrument will be dedicated to the analysis of high purity gases. The primary function will be to monitor the pur ified air, but other high purity gases will occasionally be analyzed.
As part of this requirement the Contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project, design/configuration, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation and training of EPA staff.  The Contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO 17025 standards.  The Instrument shall be a bench top unit, dedicated to the analysis of gases and must be configured to readily accept sample gas lines.  Michelson type interferometer and factory set components.  Sixty meter path length cell with bare gold coated mirrors and ZnSe windows.  Scan range shall be at least 5000 cm-1 to 500 cm-1, with the lowest selectable spectral resolution of 0.5 cm-1 or better.  The Instrument shall have an InSb liquid nitrogen cooled detector.  The Instrument shall meet the following detection  limits: 1.0 ppb for CO, CO2, H2O, CH4, and total hydrocarbons.  Dry air or nitrogen purge and an oil free diaphragm pump shall be included as an additional component to evacuate the system.  The Instrument shall interface to a PC with a Microsoft Windows based operating system.   Shall meet ISO 17025 standards, with calibration certificates for all measuring transducers.  The Contractor shall provide the operation manual and the maintenance manual for the instrument and any accessories.  A CD-ROM version of the operation manual is acceptable.
This procurement is being conducted with full and open competitive procedures under NAICS code 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Award will be made using ?Best Value? evaluation criteria.  The solicitation will be released through the internet on EPA?s home page at www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  The solicitation will also be released through www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedconnect.net. The anticipated solicitation release date is approximately 10 calendar days after the electronic posting date of this notice.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Interested parties may contact Annette Niedermier, in writing, via fax (734) 214-4569 or email at niedermier.annette@epa.gov with questions.

<DESC>  <span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate a contract on Other Than Full and Open Competition with  FEI Company, 5350 NE Dawson Creek Drive, Hillsboro, OR 97124 to provide one (1) FEI Quanta 3D 200i High- and low-vacuum, ESEM&trade; /FIB Dual Beam &trade;, which includes all associated parts, user interfaces, support, installation, warranties, inspections, and manuals.  The dual beam ESEM/FIB is capable of generating both an ion beam for material removal and an electron beam for imaging and chemical analysis.  The FEI Quanta 3D 200i High-and low-vacuum, ESEM/FIB Dual Beam has ESEM and FIB capabilities in one package. The Quanta 3D 200i provides ESEM, high resolution imaging, required for characterization of biofilms and fouled surfaces.  The ESEM/FIB operates at variable vacuum/pressure levels to permit analysis of a variety of materials and environments, distinguishing it from a standard scanning electron microscope (SEM) or low vacuum SEM (LVSEM).   The unit isolates and mills specific micron to submicron-sized areas located in situ within a host matrix in wet environments.  An incorporated energy dispersive spectral (EDS) imaging system and liquid nitrogen cooled detector provides both qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis of the specimen. <br /><br />The statutory  authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) &ndash; Only one responsible source.    All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. <br /><br />The Government intends to use FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.

DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Sample data shall be furnished to ensure compatibility with data requirements in the Forest Service operational loads Library Database software solution supplied by nCode International under contract to the US Forest Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; The OLMS Recorder shall have the capability of recording up to 100 flight hours of data, monitoring up to sixteen (16) continuous parameters and eight (8) discrete parameters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull; Desirable System Attributes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Crashworthy data storage.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Wireless Data Upload.</p>

<DESC>This is a request for information/sources sought notice(RFI) to assist the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) for the purpose of conducting market research. A solicitation is not currently available, and unsolicited proposals in responses to this RFI will not be accepted. The NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland is conducting market research for the following : DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK - Construction of Iris Image, and Finger Vein Image, Standard Reference Databases<br />BACKGROUND - After fingerprints, iris recognition has emerged as the second most widely implemented and supported biometric modality. The existence and availability of a broad range of iris image capture equipment affords users the possibility to include iris recognition in many application identification and authentication scenarios. This range also implies a diversity of technologies used for iris capture and this, in turn, raises the possibility that an iris image captured on one device may be imperfectly recognized on another. The support for the ISO/IEC 19794-6 iris image data interchange standard is a necessary but not sufficient part of the interoperability mandated by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 24 - Interoperability requires iris recognition algorithms to be capable of processing images from all cameras, and for cross-comparing them.
<p>Vascular biometrics has emerged as a biometric modality that can be captured by itself, or, in the form of a finger vein image, nearly simultaneously with traditional fingerprint image. Vascular imaging technology, embedded in single-provider products, has demonstrated accuracy and usability sufficient for authentication purposes. While the ISO/IEC 19794-9 vascular image standard has been published, there remains a paucity of image data available for development of a competitive marketplace for recognition technologies.</p>
<p>This contract supports development of standard reference databases for improved iris and vascular image performance interoperability.<br />SCOPE OF WORK -The Contractor shall collect biometric data from volunteers of their fingers and eyes as specified in this requirement.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC TASKS-The Contractor shall provide all support for project oversight, equipment, administration and technical execution of this contract. The Contractor is responsible for maintaining accurate records of project activities. The contractor shall collect biometric data from a population of consenting volunteers. The data and specific associated metadata shall be delivered to NIST. The population shall number at least 250 individuals. Data from each member of the population shall be collected on two occasions. A minimum of thirty calendar days shall separate the first and second collections. The specific data and metadata elements are tabulated in the following Table.</p>
<p># Camera Supplier Biometric Modality Number Camera Name or Description<br />1.<br />Hitachi-Omron Vascular structure between the medial and distal joints.

1.0 DESCRIPTION

This publication only constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) notice, and no formal Request for Proposal (RFP) or other types of solicitation will be issued.
  Follow-up questions may be asked of responders for clarification, but this will not indicate a selection or preference.  There will be no paper copies issued for this announcement.

Responses to this notice will be used for market research by NSWC Crane to determine industry capabilities and thus may help validate the Governments requirement for future solicitations. Information from this research could be used to establish new parameter guidelines for deploying leading edge energy solutions to expeditionary forward operating bases.

Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense.
  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or other solicitation, if any is issued. However, responders to this RFI will be notified of solicitations resulting from information obtained with this RFI. If a solicitation is released at a future date, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

2.0 PROGRAM BACKGROUND

NSWC Crane has been tasked with undertaking a current market analysis and trend assessment of the latest microgrid technologies that could be utilized in the deployment of an expeditionary forward operating base.
  SECNAV has established goals for establishing a 50 percent requirement of energy consumption that will be derived from alternative energy sources by 2020.  Through microgrid energy efficiencies, this will assist in accomplishing the following strategies:

-Increase combat efficiencies.
-Reduce footprint in current and future operations.
-Lessen energy consumption and dependence on fossil fuels.
-Achieve resource efficiency in Expeditionary Operations.

2.0 PROGRAM BACKGROUND (continued)

Through effective utilization of resources and a lessening demand for fossil fuels, not only will greater combat efficiencies be realized but with fewer fuel convoys on the road. This will diminish the number of casualties resulting from the propagation of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).

3.0 REQUESTED INFORMATION

This RFI is soliciting information that may be used to develop guidance for implementing tactical equipment and methodologies for improving overall energy efficiency and reliability at expeditionary forward operating bases.
  Specifically, NSWC Crane is looking for industry information on microgrid technologies that will meet the following criteria.

3.1 Provide capability information pertaining to leading-edge Tactical Quiet Generators (TQGs) for applicability to forward military operating positions. 

3.2 Detail energy consumption scenarios, trends, and requirements for a tactical, military Forward Operating Base (FOB).

3.3 Provide capability and cost information on FOB-specific diesel-powered generators, energy storage devices, AC/DC inverter technologies, alternative energy generation technologies, and environmental control units. 

3.4 Identify and provide information on any preexisting data on Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) energy consumption scenarios.
 

3.5 Provide information on organizations that can field Technology Readiness Level 6, or better, intelligent microgrid technologies with viable capability for future deployment in Theatre.

3.6 Identify existing and emerging energy management technologies that will realize power efficiencies and alternative energy sources available at FOB microgrids.

3.7 Provide detailed information regarding emerging Peer-to-Peer communication capabilities between generation sources applicable to a FOB microgrid.

3.8 Identify and provide information on the capability and costs for all ancillary support equipment (excluding generators and load sinks) needed for the successful operation for a forward deployed microgrid.




4.0 RESPONSE SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS, DATE AND FORMAT

NSWC Crane is seeking from responders a short information paper focusing on one or more aspects of the items depicted in section 3.0.
  Of specific interest would be those areas in which industrial leaders are expending their own R&D funds in the expectation of technical advancements or significant improvements in microgrid subject matter of which NSWC Crane may not already be aware.  The subject paper solicited should offer insights into current and near-term future industry achievements in the areas identified in section 3.0.  This is not a call for companies to necessarily focus on their own product or processes but rather to accentuate the recent overall advancements in the microgrid field and those thought to be reasonably reached within the next two years. 

It is preferential that subject papers be nonproprietary and focuses on overall trends of the marketplace.
  However, informative papers with company-sensitive data and concepts will be accepted and the Government will respect restricted data markings.  Classified material will not be accepted.  The final product preferably should be a Word Document (.doc); else an Adobe (.pdf) document will suffice.  Also, the document should be single-spaced, and no longer than five pages composed in 12 point Times New Roman font.  It is anticipated that papers received will reflect the best available technology assessments from those organizations, universities, and other research entities that are particularly knowledgeable in the microgrid energy sector.  Consolidated technology assessments from groups of performers are not anticipated.
  NSWC Crane will analyze the subject papers received and reach its own independent conclusions and recommendations.

Information papers should be prepared and submitted by 31 December 2010.  However, late-received papers will be reviewed as time allows.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

Information papers must be submitted in hard copy or by email to the Points of Contact listed section 5.0.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer<br />Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)-Survey Software <br />This exchange is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.201(e) as a Request for Information (RFI). The purpose of this RFI is for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to gain knowledge of all qualified and interested small and other than small business concerns with experience within the referenced requirement and is being issued solely for DHS' informational and planning purposes as it may relate to acquisition strategy, planning schedules, feasibility of the requirement, development of the requirement, etc. This exchange in no way represents a formal solicitation for proposals, quotations, or bids with the intent to form binding agreements based upon results. DHS may (or may not), at the agency's sole discretion, issue a formal solicitation for this requirement at a later time. Within that vein, any descriptive/requirements information provided by DHS in this exchange is subject to change and shall in no way be treated as final or binding. <br />1. Background: <br />Within the DHS Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO), Human Capital Policy and Programs (HCPP) develops, implements, and evaluates Department-wide policies and standards supporting the Secretary's strategy to ensure the continued growth of DHS employees and advance the Department's capabilities in the areas of recruitment, retention and employee development. One important way to assess the effectiveness of programs and policies is through the development, administration and analysis of employee surveys.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a need to gather general data regarding employees' perceptions of the DHS work environment. This data will be used to make workplace improvements. Data gathering will be used to (inclusive but not limited to): <br />(1) Identify reasons why employees are exiting DHS, <br />(2) Identify potential barriers to equal employment opportunity within the Department, &amp; <br />(3) Identify other employee perceptions of the DHS environment. <br />2. Requirements:<br />DHS/OCHCO is seeking information regarding the capabilities of qualified vendors to develop an agency-wide approach to data analysis that includes conducting in-house Web-based surveys.</p>
<p>Historically DHS Components have developed, conducted, and analyzed their own surveys. Moving forward, some of these efforts will be combined to gain efficiencies, ensure standardization, and create the ability to consolidate and analyze data at the Department level.</p>
<p>DHS/OCHCO requires the use of a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) survey software tool (along w/operations support, maintenance, and training). The tool will be used to develop and administer in-house web-based Enterprise agency surveys. Data provided by these surveys will help DHS evaluate its performance by forecasting organizational trends and assessing current strengths and deficiencies. The Department will also use the results to direct organizational interventions to the areas where improvement is most needed.</p>
<p>The required tool shall include, but not be limited to the following:<br />2.1 Functional Requirements <br />&bull; A survey tool that can quickly and easily create survey questions and question branching through the tool itself without the need for any programming on the survey creator's part (e.g., Java, SQL, C+, etc.)</p>
<p>&bull; A survey tool that maintains a "dynamic persistency" between branched questions when question numbering or question order change after branching is created</p>
<p>&bull; A survey tool that has an integrated email campaign manager which can deploy password protected, limited population, and open access surveys<br />o The survey tool must be able to track the progress of each survey based on information from the email campaign and responses to the survey</p>
<p>&bull; A survey tool that is fully functional behind the DHS firewall - to included email , data exchange, and reporting functions</p>
<p>&bull; A survey tool that is fully functional with DHS operating systems, internet browsers, and Microsoft Office applications</p>
<p>&bull; A survey tool that can operate with (exchange information between) other DHS HR and IT systems (e.g., API) for the purposes of preparing HR data for surveys (e.g., email campaigns and subsequent analysis and reporting)</p>
<p>&bull; The survey tool must be able to handle large-scale simultaneous responses to multiple surveys</p>
<p>&bull; A survey tool that has the ability to export data in various formats (*.CSV, *.TXT, *XLS and *XLSX, and SPSS) with labels for variables (i.e., questions) and responses</p>
<p>&bull; A survey tool that is 508 compliant.</p>
<p>3. Questions</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating the necessary qualifications to perform the above identified requirements all prospective vendors shall respond to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Is every aspect of the COTS tool 508 compliant? This includes the authoring tool used to create surveys, the end product (the survey being administered to DHS employees), and the reports generated from survey analysis? Provide specific examples.</p>
<p>2. Can the survey tool be hosted behind the DHS firewall? Please provide specific examples.</p>
<p>3. What is the contractor's experience providing a history of excellent technical and customer support? Please provide specific examples.</p>
<p>4. What is the contractor's experience in survey work/research? Provide specific examples.<br />4. Description of Information Requested:</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334220- Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. (Small Business size standard is 750 employees)
<p><br />DESCRIPTION:<br />The Global Positioning System (GPS) Wing (GPSW) at the Los Angeles Air Force Base (LAAFB) Space and Missile System Center (SMC) intends to host Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) and Specification Working Groups (SWGs) in development of the Technical Requirements Document.</p>
<p>Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM) sessions will be held from 25-29 October 2010. TIM sessions will be held 25 Oct 2010 (Monday) from 1200 to 1600 PST and held all other days from 0800 to 1600 at SAIC, 300 N. Sepulveda Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-4485. SWG sessions will subsequently be held 16-18 November 2010.</p>
<p>SWG sessions will be held from 0800 to 1600 each day at the SAIC facility. All meetings will be conducted in Conference Room 2060 with provision for teleconference and Data Exchange support.</p>
<p>The goal of MGUE is to develop, integrate, and produce M-code capable; GPS receivers for the designated lead service platforms specified in the draft MGUE Capability Development Document dated 15 December 2009. These platforms encompass Air (e.g. F-15E, Precision Guided Munitions), Ground (Raven, Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV)) and Maritime (Arleigh-Burke Class Destroyer (DDG)) domains, as well as a new military handheld unit with modernized GPS capability and improved human-machine interface features.</p>
<p>Under the emerging MGUE acquisition strategy, the GPSW is considering awarding contracts for the development and certification of production ready GPS receiver form factor cards for the Raven, EFV, F-15E, and DDG platforms that leverage existing technologies to the maximum extent to reduce development risks and to establish options for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase. Upon successful certification and operational tests/assessments, the GPSW intends to exercise options for Low-Rate Initial Production for these form factors. Finally, the GPSW intends to pursue an Offeror specified production ready Common GPS Module that can be integrated into handheld receivers. To ensure functionality, demonstrations will be conducted that show case the compatibility and the enhanced capabilities of a CGM integrated handheld.</p>
<p>The GPSW is particularly interested in feedback from prospective prime contractors to ensure the most appropriate document relevance and feasibility. Preliminary Industry discussion will be initially facilitated by two MGUE TIM meetings. Each TIM will focus upon a collaborative review of TRD/PP aviation and maritime requirements.</p>
<p>MGUE TIM #1 will provide an overview of the most current Aviation Maritime Technical Requirements Document (TRD) and companion Protection Profile (PP) "draft" documents.</p>
<p>MGUE TIM #2 will provide an overview of the most current Ground Embedded TRD and companion PP "draft" documents.</p>
<p>Subsequently, two Specification Working Group (SWG) meetings will address both platform stakeholder and industry TIM session comments.</p>
<p>MGUE SWG #1 will provide an in depth discussion of the Aviation Maritime TRD/PP requirements as they have evolved from the previous TIM #1.</p>
<p>MGUE SWG #2 will provide an in depth discussion of the Ground Embedded TRD/PP requirements as they have evolved from the previous TIM #2.</p>
<p>MGUE SWG #3 will provide a forum to address additional Industry comments and concerns. Provision will be made to accommodate one-on-one sessions with Industry to address potentially proprietary concerns.</p>
<p>The GPSW intends to publicize all recommended changes that could affect revisions to the Request for Proposal (RFP).

It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.

<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December 10, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>

You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

To maximize understanding and to clarify tasking?<br />f. What recommendations should be considered to ensure the objectives and outcomes are clearly identified?</p>
<p>5. Is the PWS written with sufficient detail to propose as an incentive type contract?</p>
<p>In regards to Small Business Opportunities:</p>
<p>6. How could the PWS be structured or broken out to better allow maximum practicable opportunity for small business participation?</p>
<p>7. Would the period of performance (5 vice 3 years) impact small business likelihood to bid?</p>
<p>8. What percentages of the various small business socio-economic categories (e.g, Veteran Owned, 8-a, Hubzone, etc.) are achievable in specific tasking areas and/or overall? What tasking would small business be most able to perform?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regards to the Period of Performance / Proposal Turn-Around:</p>
<p>9. The Government is currently assessing the impact of a 3 year Seaport order versus a 5 year MAC to support the requirements set forth in the attached Draft PWS. <br />a. What impacts, advantages, and/or disadvantages should be considered in this analysis? <br />b. Which contract (3 year Seaport or 5 year MAC) would provide the most incentive to offerors to submit a proposal. Please discuss your reasoning?</p>
<p>10. In the event of a MAC type contract award, it is possible the government will require responses to task order request for proposals (TORPs) in a compressed timeframe. What is the minimum amount of time required to submit a fully compliant task order proposal for the following dollar thresholds?<br />a. $5 Million<br />b. $10Million<br />c. &gt; $25 Million</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis. The NAICS Code is 541511. It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Consona CRM, Inc., 450 E. 96th St., Suite 300, Indianapolis, IN 46240-3797, to acquire a 12-month renewal of software maintenance and support for CIT's licensed KNOVA&reg; software products as required to support the NIH Service Desk. CIT previously selected KNOVA brand name software in 2004 for the initial design and installation to support the NIH Service Desk. KNOVA has provided infrastructure maintenance support to the NIH Service Desk since that date. KNOVA software is currently integrated into the NIH Service Desk's Remedy problem-tracking system and is used directly by the NIH Service Desk staff and other NIH technical support infrastructure components. In 2007, CIT acquired the upgrade, installation and deployment of KNOVA 7.2 to enable the NIH Service Desk to complete its transition to a service desk utilizing ITIL to assimilate the other components required to complete the service desk model. In addition to enhanced functionality, the upgrade to KNOVA 7.2 provides CIT with a Return on Investment (ROI). The acquisition of KNOVA 7.2 in 2007 was a major upgrade from the previous KNOVA Version 5.0 by providing the following enhancements: Successful deployment of KNOVA 7.2 live in the NIH environment, including installation; KNOVA Contact Center for Internal Users; and Configuration of Authoring Workflow and Document, Template and External Content Integration. KNOVA 7.2 is a top-rated product suite delivered on a powerful, adaptive NLP Search and Knowledge Management Platform. KNOVA 7.2 provides an intuitive toolset that allows the NIH Service Desk to affect the customer experience in a far more granular manner. KNOVA 7.2 features a patented self-learning search technology that enables users to access the best answers quickly. Service desk agents simply enter questions or issues in the customer's own words (supporting the Federal Government's Plain Language Initiative), and KNOVA Knowledge Desk informs them of the resolution options with the highest probability of success. Critically, this patented self-learning search and Knowledge Management engine - called the Cognitive Processor&reg; - continuously learns and improves with each transaction. KNOVA 7.2 provides a more proactive approach to managing the customer help desk experience than the traditional focus on service resolution management. The features included in KNOVA 7.2 also support collaboration across NIH Institutes/Centers. Since KNOVA engineered the existing software used by the NIH Service Desk, no other commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software product could effectively map to the existing data. Furthermore, the KNOVA 7.2 user interface supports Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. &sect; 794d). CIT has determined that KNOVA 7.2 brand name software and support is the only COTS product that can provide the enhanced software functions required by the NIH Service Desk. Consona is the only source for KNOVA software support with no authorized re-sellers. This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their software products and support specifications which will be considered by the agency. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide a software product that can fulfill all of the software requirements specified above. Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). NLM intends to make an award for this commercial item in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award. Full text of FAR clauses and provisions are available at: http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html. Responses must be received by the NLM Point of Contact within eleven (11) calendar days from the publication date of this notice. NLM Synopsis No. NLM-11-014jc shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement. RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO: Joan Coulter at jc224a@nih.gov. Inquiries regarding this notice may be made to Joan Coulter, (301) 496 6546; Fax 301 402-0642.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.</p>
<p>To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>The objective of the Placencia Peninsula Pilot Wastewater Management System Feasibility Study is to provide a roadmap and guidelines for the implementation of a pilot wastewater management system for the Placencia Peninsula. The Feasibility Study will assess technical alternatives, as well as the most favorable options for implementation of an economically justifiable wastewater management system for designing an effective inter-municipal wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal system on the Placencia Peninsula.</p>

<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, TOR, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>

<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the Information Resource Center (IRC), USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<DESC>The following is a answers to questions received from vendors in regards to the combined synopisis/solicitation. All information in the original solicitation remains the same.
According to my calculations the requested 3000watt array that you specify will be undersized for your daily loads.

WE ARE REPLACING ALL OUTDATED AND ENERGY IN-EFFICIENT APPLIANCES WITH ENERGY -STAR APPLIANCES. A PRIVATE CONSULTANT CALCULATED POWER LOADS.
Are you set on having a 48V array?  WE ARE SET ON USING 48V.
Are the solar modules required to be made in the USA? YES
Are we required to use a "brand new" cargo trailer or will a lightly used one suffice? NEW TRAILER IS REQUIRED--AS THE SOW IDENTIFIES
What type of fuel would you like the generator to operate on?  PROPANE
Has a feasibility study been performed as to other sources of alternative energy power such as Hydro, geothermal, wind, or fuel cell? YES, NO OTHER OPTIONS ARE FEASIBLE
Would you consider changing the solicitation to a RFP Design Build so that alternative methods can be addressed besides just using a trailer type system? NO 
With other methods, your cost could be significantly less, maintenance could be less of an issue, reliability could be better, and you would show a better green foot print because of not having to tow trailers around. TRAILER SYSTEM IS THE ONLY FEASIBLE OPTION
We are unclear about what constraints (if any) exist concerning the orientation of the trailer at the Bechler site. The RFQ speaks of the need to have connections on the "street side". However, that leaves open the question of which way the panels point with regard to the trailer, how the trailer is position on the site, etc. Can you please clarify what requirements exist, and what the overall site plan is? THE TRAILER WILL BE PARKED NEXT TO A GENERATOR BUILDING---WITH THE SOLAR PANELS FACING A SOUTHERN EXPOSURE. 
We read to the RFQ to be asking for delivery to take place at the Bechler site. We will need to figure these delivery costs into our quotation. Is our assumption correct? If so, please give a brief description of the condition of the road (i.e. will special towing requirements and cost be involved)? If not, please clarify as to how delivery should be planned. DELIVERY IS TO MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS, WY---ZIP CODE-82190
The RFQ requires UL approval of "electrical components". Many components in the solar industry are approved by ETL rather than than UL. Is ETL approval an acceptable alternative to UL? MUST PROVIDE PROOF THAT ETL MEETS OR EXCEEDS UL STANDARDS
 The RFQ calls for electrical control of the existing on-site generator at Bechler. Can you please clarify what functions are required/available, and provide any available information about electrical details of the interface to the existing generator? There are cost differences involved with various ways that this might go, depending on the existing infrastructure. WE ARE AWAITING WORD FROM THE PARK ELECTRICIAN WE DO NOT HAVE AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION AT THIS TIME.
Due to the fact that the peak load is 14kW and the generator is 12kW is generator support required on the inverter? NO  
Will the inverter need to be capable of backing up the generator if the house load exceeds the generator output? NO
Some industrial batteries have a 80% depth of discharge rating, to accomplish 3 days autonomy can 80% DOD be used if the battery is capable and approved by the battery manufacturer? YES
What range of seasonal adjustment do you want on the solar array? NO SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT WILL BE REQUIRED
Do you want propane tanks on the trailer? NO THE GENERATOR WILL BE TIED INTO EXISTING PROPANE TANKS THAT ARE ON SITE. THIS WILL NOT BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRATOR  
Are there any plumbing requirements for the propane supplying the generator NO
Is there any onboard propane storage? NO. THE GENERATOR WILL BE CONNECTED TO AN EXISTING PROPANE TANK THAT IS ON SITE. 
What is the intended propane storage in terms of hours of operation? NOT APPLICABLE What is the actual delivery address? (weather issues, there are mentions regarding limited access to the Bechler ranger station till July with the delivery scheduled in May)? DELIVERY TO MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS, YELLOWSTONE NP  ZIP CODE--82190 The solicitation mentions interfacing with an existing generator system, can you elaborate on this system (provide details regarding the nature of the existing generator? Size? Output?)12KW KOHLER PROPANE GENERATOR.PARK STAFF WILL DO THE INTERFACE Do all functions of the trailer (solar power generation, battery storage capacity and propane generator capacity) have to fully function when the trailer is not being used at the ranger station, I.E. when it is on display (tour)? YES 
You state that the system needs to have an onboard backup 12kW air-cooled generator. Is a high efficiency clean burning diesel generator acceptable? NO If not what is required? PROPANE
You do not specify the size or type of fuel storage tank for the on board generator.  What size is required or does it need to be configured to tie into an existing fuel supply at the site? PARK STAFF WILL PLUMB IT IN TO AN EXISTING PROPANE TANK ON SITE
You state that the trailer needs to be 20 foot tandem axle with treated wood floor.  Is the 20' length the maximum length allowed? YES  If so does the tow tongue count into the total length or just the actual dimension of the trailer box itself? TRAILER ITSELF  Does the floor have to be constructed of treated wood or can it be constructed of something more durable like rolled steel, etc? NO
You state that assembly materials and hardware for the Solar Array be aluminum or stainless steel.  Can it also be constructed with heavy duty durable rolled steel in conjunction with aluminum and/or stainless steel? YES
You state that the system needs to provide 3 days of autonomy due to cloudy weather as well as stating to provide sufficient batteries to provide 3 days of autonomy with 50% depth of discharge.  With an onboard Generator, the trailer system is automatically programmed to engage the generator when the batteries get to a specified discharge level and remain on until they are charged fully or until the PV array once again is producing power to charge the batteries.  Do the batteries need to be sufficient for 3 days with 50% or can it be something slightly less and be augmented with the on board generator as designed? NO
You state to locate the power harness to site generator connections, etc on left side of trailer (street side).  Can these connections be located at the rear of the trailer so long as all electrical specifications are meet or exceeded? YES
Does the generator have to run all night when the solar panels are inoperative? NO  If yes what is the load factor/ watts that is required? INFO IS IN THE SOLICATATION
What size propane tank is estimated to be required and how is it refueled? WILL BE TIED TO AN EXISTING PROPANE TANK ON SITE
Is refueling to be included in the proposal? NO
Would you consider using a fuel cell to replace the generator and the 3 day battery back-up requirement? NO

1.Is there a requirement for US Citizenship for all workers?  Answer 1:  Yes.  All workers must be a U.S. citizen or have a valid work visa. 
2.Is there a requirement for all workers to have passed E-Verify? Answer 2:  No, but the workers shall be U.S. citizens or have a valid work visa.
3.Is there a requirement for OSHA 10 or 30 for the job superintendent or foreman positions? Answer 3: No, it is the General Contractor's responsibility to make sure the employees meet all OSHS requirements and company safety policies.
4.Is there an approved or preferred sprinkler contractor?  .Answer 4:  No, as long as the sub-contractor has a Virginia State License.  A copy of the license shall be given to the Contracting Officer before work begins.
5. Is there an approved or preferred fire alarm contractor? Answer 5:  Yes, the existing maintenance contractor will disarm the fire alarm system before any work shall start.  The contractor has the responsibility to acquire the permit before work begins as per scope of work.
6. Is certified payroll due weekly? Answer 6:  No.  All payrolls shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer when the job is complete and the job has been inspected and accepted.  Then the invoice shall be submitted with all proper payroll documents upon completion.
7.  Are new partition walls built to the underside of the ceiling grid or to the underside of the 3rd floor deck? Answer 7: All new walls shall be to the underside of ceiling.
8.  The existing concealed spline ceiling has a 1'-0" +/- wide gypsum board soffit.  Does this soffit extend to the following perimeter of new walls? Answer 8:  Yes, as per scope of work the gypsum board white boarder shall match the perimeter boarder.
9.  Scope of work references painting all ceilings.  Does this include the 12" x 12" ceiling tile or is it the GWB areas only? Answer 9:  Yes, paint the entire ceiling, boarder and 1' x 1' ceiling tiles.
10.  Under drawings on page 1 of 2, in the hallway it states Partition To Be Enclosed 20' from Existing Door Lever. Can you clarify this statement?Answer 10: The location of new doors shall meet ADA code requirements for accessibility (wheel chairs). 11.  Under drawings you are calling for a Hard Ceiling. Are we to assume that is Gypsum Board or are we to quote Acoustical Ceiling Tile?Answer 11: Yes, the contractor will have to construct gypsum board boarders and install 1' x 1' ceiling tiles in the center of ceilings. The contractor will demo the existing ceiling that will be in the new hallway before installing the suspended drop ceiling. 12.  Will you post and make available to all bidders the site visit sign-in sheet?Answer 12: No.   13.  In the specifications it is calling for a substantial completion date of 01/05/2011. What is the anticipated date of award? Answer 13: The USGS does not have an actual award date, but would like to have the requirement awarded no later than 12/05/2010. 14.  In the SOW narrative it states that the contractor shall install 5 new doors and frames. Is it correct that if we re-use 2 of the demoed doors and frames, then we would only have to additionally provide 3 new doors, frames and hardware?Answer 14: Yes, providing the door, jam and hinges work proper and are not damaged during demo.  All door locks are required to be handles and not door knobs that don't meet code.
15.  Please clarify if in fact a new pneumatic operated thermostat will be required in 210 A and 208 A for heating and cooling control.Answer 15: No, thermostat will be required.
16.  In the solicitation Table of Contents on page 14 of 24 it calls for certified testing of mechanical systems and electrical systems including the new UPS. I did not see any new UPS in the narrative or drawings. Please clarify whether certified testing of any kind is required and whether or not there is a new UPS called for anywhere?Answer 16:  Contractors are not required to test or install a new UPS system.  Verbiage about any UPS is to be removed from the SOW as this was a typo.
17.  Can you provide a building standard specification for the wood doors and hollow metal frames?Answer 17: The doors are commercial grade 1 " thick hard board.  The frames are commercial knock down frames.  The lock sets are commercial grade as per scope of work.
18.  Does everything being painted receive a prime coat and then two finish coats and that all paint is provided by the owner?Answer 18: All new walls shall be primed and receive two coats of finish paint.  Existing walls shall receive two coats of paint and no primer.  If the contractor reuses the existing doors and frames the contractor will have to sand both doors and jams before painting.  Original doors had oil base paint on them and shall be prepped for latex paint.
19.  Is our summary breakdown of our bid to be done on our own forms or is there a form that you provide?Answer 19: The vendors shall use their own forms to include all requested information in the instruction to vendors.  The USGS does not provide a form to use for the breakdown.

<DESC>As a follow-up to the Industry Day conducted on 15 October 2010, the 55th Contracting Squadron, in support of the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), a Department of Defense (DoD) Field Activity under the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&amp;L)), operating under the authority, direction, and control of the Director, Defense Research &amp; Engineering (DDR&amp;E), is conducting market research to determine industry capability (i.e., small and large businesses to include institutions of higher learning) to perform Information Analysis Center (IAC) Basic Center Operations (BCO) in the focus areas of Information Assurance, Software Data and Analysis, Modeling and Simulation, and Knowledge Management and Information Sharing collectively referred to as the Cyber Security Information Analysis Center (CSIAC) BCO (NOTE: focus area scope/definitions, as well as important DoD IAC Program web links critical to understanding the requirements, are at the back of the CSIAC BCO Sources Sought/Request for Information Questionnaire). This market research will aid the 55th Contracting Squadron and DTIC in determining whether the BCO focus areas can reasonably be combined into a single award contract and whether there is sufficient small business capability to support a small business set-aside. Regarding small business set-aside considerations, it is important to note that responses to this sources sought must reasonably demonstrate an expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small businesses, who have Defense Contract Audit Agency-confirmed adequate accounting systems suitable for a cost reimbursement contract, that clearly demonstrate their capability to bring the best scientific and technological resources to bear and to do so in an manner that would ensure that at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel would be expended by employees of that small business concern. In addition, small business size status responses to this sources sought/request for information will be verified by the government via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) before making any small business set-aside determination and as such, it is imperative that small businesses ensure their ORCA records are current and accurate (https://orca.bpn.gov/). <br /><br />
<p>This is a follow-on to the IAC Industry Day conducted on 15 October 2010 in which the IAC Program Way-Ahead contemplated acquisition strategy was announced, the presentation for which is posted on FedBizOpps.Gov under Solicitation Number "FA1500-11-MKTRES." It is the responsibility of parties interested in this CSIAC BCO market research effort, as well as other IAC Program market research activities, to monitor Solicitation Number "FA1500-11-MKTRES" at FedBizOpps.Gov and towards that end the government recommends you place yourself on the FedBizOpps.Gov "Watch This Opportunity" list, which will generate automatic email notification of any changes to the FedBizOpps.Gov announcement. You might also take advantage of the FedBizOpps.Gov "Add Me to Interested Vendors" list should you desire that other interested parties know of your interest in these requirements.</p>
<p>The information being requested is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a commitment by the government for any purpose. Responses are strictly voluntary and the government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with the submittal of the requested information. Any information submitted in response to this sources sought/request for information is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC &sect; 552(a). The government does not request any proprietary information be submitted, nor shall it be liable, for any consequential damages for any proprietary information.<br /><br />Responses to this sources sought/request for information are due no later than 4:00 PM local time, 30 November 2010 and shall be submitted via email to CSIACBCO@offutt.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>DATA LINK SYSTEM for Next-generation Training Pod for Air Combat Training System<br />FedBizOpps -- Request for Information:
<p>The Air Force Material Command, Air Armament Center (AAC) is evaluating impacts of the proposed Government sell-off of 1755-1850 MHz frequency band with proposed offset frequency bands of 4.4-4.94 GHz and 5.95-6.7 GHz. Technical options for the P5 Combat Training System are being considered and Government cost estimating is being accomplished, taking into consideration preferred technical approaches. THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BID (IFB) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.<br /><br />The AAC recognizes the importance of industry involvement in the development of technical options. Below are a number of design characteristics and constraints for interested industry partners to seed immediate discussions. All interested parties are asked to respond with proposed technical approaches to Mr Paul Leary, Jr. by 23 Nov 2010. Interested parties are encouraged to email paul.leary@eglin.af.mil or call Mr Leary at (850) 883-3464 to discuss technical options. Mr Edward McCall is our alternate contact. He can be reached at (850) 883-3787, or email to edward.mccall@eglin.af.mil.<br /><br />In light of the propagation and atmospheric attenuation considerations and the physical design limitations imposed by the 4.4-4.94 GHz and 5.95-6.7 GHz frequency bands, non-traditional approaches to achieving required RF network performance will be entertained. Discussions can continue beyond 23 Nov 2010, but the Government cost estimating schedule requires that initial concepts be identified and communicated to cost estimators by 1 Dec 2010.<br /><br />Design Characteristics and Constraints:<br />&bull; The digital data link transceiver will have the option to operate at 4.4-4.94 GHz and/or 5.95-6.7 GHz<br />&bull; Design will achieve a technology readiness level (ref DoD Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) Deskbook) of 6 or more by 2015<br />&bull; The data link transceiver will be a shop replaceable assembly contained in airborne, shipboard, and ground-based instrumentation packages used to support air combat training<br />&bull; Support networking/IP-based data traffic exchanges in broadcast (point-to-multi-point) and unicast (point-to-point) modes with air, ground, and shipboard nodes (both stationary and moving)<br />&bull; Support 100 to 160 high dynamic military fighter aircraft nodes concurrently in an ad hoc self forming/self healing network<br />&bull; Meet the environmental requirements of a high performance military fighter aircraft<br />&bull; Meet the environmental requirements of a military helicopter<br />&bull; Meet DoD electromagnetic interference requirements<br />&bull; Operate over all altitudes from 0-60,000 feet<br />&bull; Exhibit a system-level mean time between failure of at least 500 hours operational<br />&bull; Be designed for producibility and sustainability<br />&bull; Provide successful Air-to-Air digital communications connectivity 95+% of the time at 65 nautical miles (nmi) and 90+% of the time at 65-80 nmi given unobstructed line of sight between communications nodes<br />&bull; Provide successful Air-to-Ground digital communications connectivity 90+% of the time at 125 nmi given unobstructed line of sight between communications nodes<br />&bull; Provide system Air-to-Ground digital communications connectivity 85+% of the time at 200 nmi, utilizing relays if required, given unobstructed line of sight between individual communications nodes<br />&bull; Support an overall network user data throughput of 0.5-2.0 Mbps<br />&bull; Support a message latency of 50 ms or less<br />&bull; Support an airborne pod configuration constrained to an aircraft compatible shape, traditionally an AIM-9 missile tube volume. If necessary, solutions will not be limited to an AIM-9 missile tube volume or to a single pod. <br />&bull; Weight and shape cannot constrain aircraft's combat performance and must meet air worthiness requirements<br />&bull; Prefer a design that, for a single component of the training system, supports not more than a three man lift<br />&bull; Solution must be compatible with aircraft power<br />In the November 2010 response, please include:</p>
<p>A. Proposed solution (mark &lsquo;proprietary' as appropriate) and specific driving challenges to the development (technology and technical risk, safety, reliability, miniaturization requirements, production, etc)<br />B. Contractor's contact information for further discussion of the proposed solution<br />C. Contractor experience in this area <br />D. Contractor facility location</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334220- Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. (Small Business size standard is 750 employees)
<p><br />DESCRIPTION:<br />The Global Positioning System (GPS) Wing (GPSW) at the Los Angeles Air Force Base (LAAFB) Space and Missile System Center (SMC) intends to host Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) and Specification Working Groups (SWGs) in development of the Technical Requirements Document.</p>
<p>Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM) sessions will be held from 25-29 October 2010. TIM sessions will be held 25 Oct 2010 (Monday) from 1200 to 1600 PST and held all other days from 0800 to 1600 at SAIC, 300 N. Sepulveda Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-4485. SWG sessions will subsequently be held 16-18 November 2010.</p>
<p>SWG sessions will be held from 0800 to 1600 each day at the SAIC facility. All meetings will be conducted in Conference Room 2060 with provision for teleconference and Data Exchange support.</p>
<p>The goal of MGUE is to develop, integrate, and produce M-code capable; GPS receivers for the designated lead service platforms specified in the draft MGUE Capability Development Document dated 15 December 2009. These platforms encompass Air (e.g. F-15E, Precision Guided Munitions), Ground (Raven, Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV)) and Maritime (Arleigh-Burke Class Destroyer (DDG)) domains, as well as a new military handheld unit with modernized GPS capability and improved human-machine interface features.</p>
<p>Under the emerging MGUE acquisition strategy, the GPSW is considering awarding contracts for the development and certification of production ready GPS receiver form factor cards for the Raven, EFV, F-15E, and DDG platforms that leverage existing technologies to the maximum extent to reduce development risks and to establish options for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase. Upon successful certification and operational tests/assessments, the GPSW intends to exercise options for Low-Rate Initial Production for these form factors. Finally, the GPSW intends to pursue an Offeror specified production ready Common GPS Module that can be integrated into handheld receivers. To ensure functionality, demonstrations will be conducted that show case the compatibility and the enhanced capabilities of a CGM integrated handheld.</p>
<p>The GPSW is particularly interested in feedback from prospective prime contractors to ensure the most appropriate document relevance and feasibility. Preliminary Industry discussion will be initially facilitated by two MGUE TIM meetings. Each TIM will focus upon a collaborative review of TRD/PP aviation and maritime requirements.</p>
<p>MGUE TIM #1 will provide an overview of the most current Aviation Maritime Technical Requirements Document (TRD) and companion Protection Profile (PP) "draft" documents.</p>
<p>MGUE TIM #2 will provide an overview of the most current Ground Embedded TRD and companion PP "draft" documents.</p>
<p>Subsequently, two Specification Working Group (SWG) meetings will address both platform stakeholder and industry TIM session comments.</p>
<p>MGUE SWG #1 will provide an in depth discussion of the Aviation Maritime TRD/PP requirements as they have evolved from the previous TIM #1.</p>
<p>MGUE SWG #2 will provide an in depth discussion of the Ground Embedded TRD/PP requirements as they have evolved from the previous TIM #2.</p>
<p>MGUE SWG #3 will provide a forum to address additional Industry comments and concerns. Provision will be made to accommodate one-on-one sessions with Industry to address potentially proprietary concerns.</p>
<p>The GPSW intends to publicize all recommended changes that could affect revisions to the Request for Proposal (RFP). If your contractor team would like to participate in these TIMs and/or SWGs, please make an appointment as instructed below. Please identify a primary POC for your company, along with phone number and e-mail address.</p>

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />5.2 Atlantic Test Range<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />1.0 Description</span></strong></p>
<p>1.1 The Naval Air Warfare Systems Command (NAWCAD) in support of the 5.2 Atlantic Test Range is seeking information regarding the follow on effort for Range Support Services.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, at this time, the Navy is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the NAWCAD Central website at http://www.navair.navy.mil/ , or the Navy's electronic platform for acquiring services (Seaport) at http://www.seaport.navy.mil/default.aspx. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2.0 Background</strong></span></p>
<p>The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) is seeking information regarding a technical, engineering, project management, administrative, logistics, security, and IT support services requirement to support the Atlantic Test Range and its operations. Services will be provided for three business units provided below:</p>
<p>Atlantic Target and Marine Operations Division (AIR-5.3.3):</p>
<p>The Atlantic Target and Marine Operations Division provides sea, air, and land targets for testing and training events. The division provides the personnel and surface assets to support the range safety clearance function, to conduct at sea testing, and to recover test articles that have been dropped on the over-water range areas.</p>
<p>Atlantic Test Range (ATR) Facility:</p>
<p>The Atlantic Test Range Facility provides the people, skills, knowledge, processes, facilities, and equipment required for the development, test, operation, and maintenance of various systems required to operate the open-air test facilities. The Atlantic Test Range Facility applies these skills and knowledge to support requirements for test operations.</p>
<p>Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentation (AVMI) Facility.</p>
<p>Air Vehicle Modification and Instrumentation (AVMI) designs, develops, procures, builds, installs, tests and evaluates, calibrates, modifies, operates and maintains instrumentation on aircraft and engines for the Navy and other government, commercial and foreign government customers. AVMI is the lead for developing future network-based data acquisition systems. In addition, AVMI provides technical consultation to NAVAIRSYSCOM, OPNAV, DOD, contractors, and field activities and other government agencies.</p>
<p>2.1 Delivery Period:</p>
<p>Services to be provided will be required for either a 3 or 5 year period from date of contract award. Estimated timeframe for contract award is August to September 2012.</p>
<p>2.2 Limitations:</p>
<p>Currently, there are no limitations associated with this effort; however, as a result of continued market research the government reserves the right to set aside either a portion or all of this effort for small business.</p>
<p><br />2.3 Security Requirements:</p>
<p>A security clearance is not required for all personnel in the specific labor categories; however, the ability to obtain a clearance is required for all personnel. Therefore, the contractor shall submit for government approval, and when required by individual tasking, a classified visit request for any contractor personnel requiring access to secured areas on or off-site. The request shall be addressed to the security office of the hosting site and contain the following; an alphabetical listing of contractor personnel with date of birth, place of birth, social security number, clearance status, contract number, site point of contact and duration of visit.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3.0 Requested Information:</strong></span></p>
<p>Performance Work Statement (PWS) DRAFT:</p>
<p>1. The Government is currently in the process of restructuring the Range Performance Work Statement (PWS) and is considering segregating the PWS into multiple requirements which could lead to the award of either a Multiple Award Contract (MAC) or multiple Seaport task orders.<br />a. Please provide recommendations on what factors should be considered when determining whether the attached Draft PWS structure should be modified? <br />b. Additionally, recommendations on the factors that should be considered with regard to separation of tasking (i.e., is there a benefit to separating the tasks into multiple contracts, if separation occurs does it make more sense to segregate tasks by business unit, competency, or functional area (Engineering services, Admin, etc.), etc.)? <br />c. Finally, how does each of these strategies affect your likelihood to bid?</p>
<p>2. Would the issuance of a solicitation in Seaport-E maximize or limit competition? <br />a. Does your company currently hold an account in Seaport-E and are you eligible to propose on requirements executed in Zone 2?</p>
<p>3. The Government is in the process of identifying efficiencies in regard to execution of the PWS in the areas of cost and performance. Considering this goal, as well as the need to support tasking identified in the attached Draft PWS:<br />a. What factors (including positive and negative) should be considered when attempting to create increased efficiencies? <br />b. What factors (including positive and negative) should be considered when contemplating separation of tasks within the structure of the PWS or by creating multiple PWSs?</p>
<p>4. Upon reviewing the attached Draft PWS, what are the main variables/factors considered when making a determination to bid or not to bid (i.e., CLIN structure, contract type, contract length, subcontracting goals, socio-economic programs, incentives, period of performance, contract historical data). What should the Government consider:<br />a. To enhance competition?<br />b. To increase Small Business participation?<br />c. To reduce costs?<br />d. To acquire the appropriate skill mix?<br />e. To maximize understanding and to clarify tasking?<br />f. What recommendations should be considered to ensure the objectives and outcomes are clearly identified?</p>
<p>5. Is the PWS written with sufficient detail to propose as an incentive type contract?</p>
<p>In regards to Small Business Opportunities:</p>
<p>6. How could the PWS be structured or broken out to better allow maximum practicable opportunity for small business participation?</p>
<p>7. Would the period of performance (5 vice 3 years) impact small business likelihood to bid?</p>
<p>8. What percentages of the various small business socio-economic categories (e.g, Veteran Owned, 8-a, Hubzone, etc.) are achievable in specific tasking areas and/or overall? What tasking would small business be most able to perform?</p>
<p>In regards to the Period of Performance / Proposal Turn-Around:</p>
<p>9. The Government is currently assessing the impact of a 3 year Seaport order versus a 5 year MAC to support the requirements set forth in the attached Draft PWS. <br />a. What impacts, advantages, and/or disadvantages should be considered in this analysis? <br />b. Which contract (3 year Seaport or 5 year MAC) would provide the most incentive to offerors to submit a proposal. Please discuss your reasoning?</p>
<p>10. In the event of a MAC type contract award, it is possible the government will require responses to task order request for proposals (TORPs) in a compressed timeframe. What is the minimum amount of time required to submit a fully compliant task order proposal for the following dollar thresholds?<br />a. $5 Million<br />b. $10Million<br />c. &gt; $25 Million</p>

<a href="mailto:pamela.devon@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>QUESTION: Would we be allowed to reach out to the participants prior to the retreat? 
RESPONSE: This  would be acceptable but the Vet Center therapist would first obtain approval from the veteran prior to authorizing the contact. 

QUESTION: Given the highly sensitive nature of this Retreat, we would like to know if we can "pilot the pilot"?  This would mean we would facilitate an abbreviated (2-day?) version of the program with key stakeholders to get their feedback prior to launching the program with returning veterans.  This session could be held in the DC area or wherever a cadre of key stakeholders is located.
RESPONSE:  We will evaluate the quality of their program based on their submission, we do not believe that this would be a necessary step but only add expense to the program.
  

QUESTION:  Please clarify regarding the Early Intervention and Transition Assistance for OEF/OIF Female Combat Veterans and Their Families. Are you only looking for Retreat Locations or are you looking for group of Trainers/Instructors to deliver training on Transition training, Financial Management, Conflict Resolution, Stress Management Etc or both Personnel AND Retreat location?
RESPONSE: We are looking for both the retreat locations and the retreat hosts to deliver the training.

QUESTION:   Is this contract a base of  1 YR with one option year?
RESPONSE: This contract is for one base year with one (1) one-year renewal option.
