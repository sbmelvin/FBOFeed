<DESC>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to enter into a contract to support advanced development of new or improved influenza virus diagnostic laboratory test systems that meet U.S. regulatory requirements for use in U.S. clinical laboratories.  Products for influenza virus testing should have high sensitivity and specificity, along with reliability, capability for testing larger numbers of specimens with reduced tech time, reasonable cost, and flexibility to run single or multiple assays (to include assays for specific influenza A subtypes) on the same specimen and quickly adapt to testing for new pandemic virus candidates, or subtypes.
These tests should have capability to detect all influenza A viruses and differentiate novel from seasonal influenza viruses and other human respiratory viruses.  Proposals for multi-marker or individual assays, methods and platforms that may meet inter-pandemic and pandemic testing scenarios will be considered.  Besides meeting or exceeding the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity performance of currently used laboratory-based diagnostic tests (primarily viral culture and IFA/DFA), the laboratory influenza diagnostic test system is expected to enable an increased number of specimens that can be tested in medium and large hospital, academic hospital, and commercial laboratories with reduced hands-on time.  In addition, instrument purchase price, footprint and per assay costs are important considerations for practical use and implementation.  The final objective of this contract is to have a new or improved FDA approved laboratory diagnostic test system for use in U.S. clinical laboratories within 2-3 years that meets the criteria noted above.  The contractor will provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to achieve the above mentioned objectives.  Incremental funding for a cost-reimbursement type contract will be provided to support this effort.  A pre-proposal meeting/conference will be held prior to the due date for the receipt of proposals.  The date, time, and location for the preproposal meeting will be included in the solicitation.  RFP 2007-N-09247 will be available on or about June 1, 2007.  The solicitation can be accessed through the internet at: www.fbo.gov.  Any amendments issued to the solicitation will also be made available at the same website.  It is the Contractor?s responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding this RFP on the FedBizOpps website.  Full and open competition will be used in soliciting offers for this requirement.  This procurement will not be set-aside for small business.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Agency.  Any questions/concerns about the subject RFP shall be submitted via e-mail to Jeff Miller at afx2@cdc.gov.

<DESC>United State Secret Service
Request for Information 
HSSS01-07-R-0027

1.	General Information
The United States Secret Service (USSS), as a law enforcement agency, has a need to provide adequate concealable body armor to its personnel.  Body armor is acquired for new agents, new uniform division personnel, new physical security specialists, replacement of damaged samples, and to maintain the continuity of a five years replacement cycle.  The vendors interested in responding to this formal request for information (RFI) shall be capable of supporting a procurement need of approximately 600 vests per year. 

To effectively meet the mission, USSS body armor must be flexible, thin, and lightweight.  The armor shall be designed to be worn as an undergarment and it shall be concealable under street clothes such as a normal business suit.  The armor shall be designed in such a manner as to prevent the armor from "riding up" on the wearer and becoming apparent during normal law enforcement duty activities.  The armor shall provide adjustments for the chest, waist, and shoulders. The areal density of the armor panels cannot exceed 0.95 pounds per square feet (psf).  Manufacturers providing information are highly encouraged to describe how their body armor models are  constructed with the best and most advanced construction materials available to provide a lightweight and flexible solution.  Specific details about carriers, outer tactical garments, and carry bags are not part of this RFI.  

The objectives of this RFI are: 1) to identify commercial vendors that produce lightweight and flexible state-of-the-art concealable body armor; 2) to improve the overall understanding of commercial off the shelf products and ballistic performance; and 3) to invite industry to submit information that will allow the USSS to prepare a competitive specification that utilizes state of the art materials and novel technologies. 

THIS RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, NOR DOES IT CONSTITUTE A CURRENT OR FUTURE GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENT.  IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT.  ANY INFORMATION, OR DATA, PROVIDED TO THE GOVERNMENT IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY AND AT NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT.


2.	Body Armor Specifications of Interest
Manufacturers interested in responding to this RFI shall submit information only for concealable body armor models that meet or exceed the general specifications described below.  

2.0.	All body armor samples must meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements for the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Level IIIA body armor as specified in NIJ Standard-0101.04 and NIJ 2005 Interim Requirements for Bullet resistance Body Armor.  Copies of NIJ compliance letters are requested. 
2.1.	The recommended body armor model must be flexible, thin, and lightweight.  The areal density of the recommended model cannot exceed 0.95 pounds per square feet (psf).  Provide documentation of reported areal density (preferably measured by an independent laboratory). 

2.2.	Minimum Ballistic Performance Requirements.  Provide laboratory test sheets to support reported information. 
 
Caliber	Bullet Weight	Bullet Description	Recommended
Manufacturer	Minimum V50 (fps)
9 mm Luger	124 grain	FMJ RN	Remington	1710
.44 S&W	240 grain	SJHP	Remington	1650
.357 SIG	125 grain	GDHP	Speer	1680


2.3.	Additional ballistic data:  Submission of ballistic data concerning some the threats listed below are recommended to assist the Government in understanding the state of the body armor technology.
a.	Winchester 9 mm +P+ SXT
b.	Federal .40 S&W JHP 135 grain
c.	Federal .40 S&W JHP 155 grain
d.	7.62 x 25 mm Tokerov (steel core) 
e.	Data from other threats are highly encouraged. 
f.	Fragment Simulating Projectile data is encouraged.

2.4.	Warranty:  Provide warranty information.  Body armor model must carry a minimum ballistic warranty of five (5) years.  



3.	Data/Information Requested
Private Sector Industry is invited to submit written capability statements to include open market pricing information.  Submission should include documentation supporting the body armor characteristics described in section 2.0.  Two (2) complete body armor garments (one male size XL, one female size M) of the recommended model or models is requested for inspection and evaluation.  Points of contact for follow-up communications will be noted. 

Responses should include product data sheets and also provide information to include whether their sample products are offered on GSA Schedule contracts or Government Wide Contracts (GWACs).  All samples will be returned to vendors who respond to the RFI. 



4.	 Note on Proprietary Information 
It is not the USSS intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this RFI.  To the full extent that is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as Proprietary or Confidential will be kept confidential.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is planning to purchase from Accu-Temp Inc., Kentube Engineers Products Co. Items: Fuel Economizer / Heat Exchanger.  This is a direct replacement of the existing Fuel Economizer which was installed as a part of the Keeler Boiler in 1979.  By purchasing a direct replacement of the original equipment, the cost of installation will be minimized.  The dimensions of the replacement must be compatible with the existing (i.e. any connections, water, flue) in order to eliminate any required field modifications.  The performance of the Kentube Fuel Economizer is matched to the pressurized requirements of the Keeler Boiler.  This impacts not only the preheat characteristics of the feedwater, but also the gas temperature requirements of the baghouse.  The agency is unaware of any comparable product on the market that will meet the needs of the agency.  However, the agency will consider any response(s) to this announcement received by April, 22, 2006, in determining whether or not to compete this requirement.  If the agency determines to compete this requirement, a RFQ will be issued solely to the responder of this notice; a subsequent presolicitation notice will not be issued.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures will be utilized.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a Federal Contract.  Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to conduct arcjet testing of an ablative thermal protection system (TPS) material. The Mars Science Laboratory Entry, Descent and Landing Instrumentation (MEDLI) project has been approved to incorporate an atmospheric data system into the Mars Science Laboratory heatshield, for collecting valuable environmental data during the Mars entry.  This data system includes a series of pressure ports, through the TPS, which feed to pressure transducers mounted inside the aeroshell.  The MEDLI project is on a very aggressive schedule, and an early determination of the proper port configuration is critical to successful integration with the MSL schedule.  A matrix of arcjet tests is necessary to find the port diameter that can be sustained under pyrolysis and ablation, providing a good pressure measurement without compromising heatshield integrity. A series of 14 test runs were performed at the Boeing Large Core Arc Tunnel (LCAT) from February 19 to March 1, 2007, to evaluate various size pressure ports in the Super Lightweight Ablator (SLA) 561V heat shield material at MSL-relevant entry heating levels. During this test series, some of the data requirements were compromised because of the small model size (2 inches), chosen by NASA to meet the test conditions.  The test results showed a need to perform further testing to improve the data fidelity by using a larger model size (3 to 4 inches). Boeing performed a series of exploratory calibration runs from March 26 to March 30, 2007, to assess the potential of the LCAT facility to meet the required conditions with a larger nozzle, to accommodate 3 to 4 inch samples.  This calibration series confirmed that the conditions can be met in the LCAT facility, on samples of 3 to 4 inch diameter.	The next test series at LCAT is required, to recover data compromised in the previous test effort due to the small model size, and to acquire additional data to evaluate pressure port size effectiveness. For the next test series, expected conditions at the pressure port locations range between 100 and 140 W/cm2 in hot wall heat rate, and 0.15 to 0.25 atmospheres in pressure.  The test matrix consists of 9 points spanning these conditions, with 2 port diameters to be compared at each condition.  These tests will require up to eight thermocouple and four pressure transducer accommodations per sample.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the arcjet testing services from Boeing, Inc. who is the only known source for providing these arcjet conditions on a reliable schedule in the timeframe required.  The NASA/Ames arcjet complex could accomplish these test conditions, but the schedule is very constrained and volatile.  A recent facility failure at Ames has increased the uncertainty in the ability to accomplish these tests in the timeframe needed.  The tests need to be started by late May 2007 to define the configuration, so a test facility must be secured immediately.  The lead time for fabricating the facility-dependent samples is 3 weeks.	During the testing, the facility must implement procedures for safeguarding the proprietary materials to be tested, such as keeping the test samples in a locked cabinet and limiting personnel access to the tests.  Boeing is equipped to implement such procedures. Authority for the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is provided by FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (PL 104-106, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as amended by PL 109-163, Section 1443 of the FY 2006 National Defense Authorization Act). This authority is available for use in acquiring commercial items not exceeding $5.5 million. The Boeing Company, is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements under the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1).	The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 25, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a firm fixed priced award to IMS Health, 660 West Germantown Pike, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462 for data to support the development of U.S. expenditure estimates for prescriptions drugs in the National Health Expenditure Accounts from IMS Health.  IMS Health will provide 2005 and 2006 data from the National Prescription Audit and Time Series Data from the Retail Method of Payment Report for the number of new prescriptions, number of refill prescriptions, pharmaceutical acquisition dollars and total retail dollars.  IMS will also provide data on VA Centralized Mail Order Pharmacy Expenditures and DDD Class of Trade Report.  The IMS National Prescription Audit data was determined to be the most comprehensive source of prescription drug information on the market.  No other data set could approach the reliability and consistency of those offered by IMS Health.  The large number of retail pharmacies that report to IMS (a 20,000 pharmacy sample), the innovative computer design used to collect the data, and the use of sophisticated sampling techniques employed makes their database a superior one.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>Modify/Upgrade Existing Control System at the Energy Center. The Department of Veterans Affairs, Jesse Brown VA Medical Center, 820 S. Damen, Chicago, IL 60612 intends to negotiate and award a Sole Source design-build contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements to Energy Systems Group.  Jesse Brown VA Medical Center has a requirement to have its existing energy system controls which operates the transition between the gas powered turbine and the local utility supply modified to operate with a new 750 KVA transformer that will be installed by the local utility company.  The upgrade in controls is required since the electrical load for the facility will increase as a result of building a new patient bed tower.  Controls are designed to provide a seamless transition from the turbine (electric power) to local utility which is the facility secondary source of power.  These controls also allow the turbine to operate in parallel with the local utility when the electrical power requirements of the facility are greater than the capacity of the turbine.  Replacement of these controls is critical to the operation of the Medical Center and must be designed to prevent the loss of power to the Medical Center in the event of a turbine failure.  The proposed contractor, Energy Systems Group designed and installed the existing control system that is currently in operation.  This contactor is owner and operator of the Energy Center that supplies electricity, Steam and Chilled Water to the medical center, VBA office building and the facility parking garage.  It is believed that since Energy Systems Group is the original designer and installer of the system, has sole responsibility and liability for the proper operation of these controls under the Enhanced Use Lease contract, that they are the only responsible sole source capable of making required modifications to satisfy the agency requirement.  A justification for other than full and open competition is prepared in support of this acquisition. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government. Applicable NAICS codes 541330 and 238210.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Army Communications-Electronic Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) intends to award a new work modification to contract W15P7T-04-C-P019 on a non-competitive basis in support of the Massively Deployable Unattended Ground Sensor  (MDUGS) system. The anticipated award will be made under the Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, to General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Inc. (GDAIS), Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Government does not po sses detailed technical data for the MDUGS software and algorithms to provide to other potential sources. MDUGS is an advanced networked acoustic, seismic, and infrared sensor suite capable of detecting vehicle and personnel targets.  The primary goal of this proposed R&D effort is to refine the image processing algorithms that do moving target indication (MTI) to provide a more robust capability in the presence of noisy backgrounds and enhance the ability to track multiple targets. The MDUGS will be used to demonstrate critical technical elements in support of the Army's Future Combat Systems' (FCS') UGS and the Army's Area Denial Sensors program. The additional effort is expected to have a period of performance of approximately 12 months. A tracking numbe r W15P7T-06-R-P436 has been assigned to this effort and should be reference along with contract number W15P7T-04-C-P019. TECHNICAL questions should be addressed to Mr. Mark Gahler; email mark.gahler@nvl.army.mil, (703) 704-1315. CONTRACTUAL questions shoul d be addressed to Mr. Andrew Dellomo, Contracting Officer, email; Andrew.dellomo@us.army.mil; 732-532-3569 or Ms. Meghan Mele, Contract Specialist, email; Meghan.mele@us.army.mil, 732-532-8299.

<CONTACT>Elayne Seiler, 301-619-7358
<DESC>SUBJECT:  NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT DESC:  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, it is the Governments intent to award a sole source to Nanogen, 10398 Pacific Center Court, San Diego, CA 92121, for the purchase of the Nanochi p NC 400 Instrument and accessories.  The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology currently utilizes the NC100.  All the assays developed on the NC100 can be easily transferred to the NC400 with no need for re-optimization.  Switching to a new instrument from a different manufacturer with different reagents and capabilities would take two years to optimize and revalidate.  This is not a formal solicitation. This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.  No solicitation document is availab le and telephone requests will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Gover nment.  If no affirmative written response is received, the service will be awarded without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  De tailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email address no later than 4:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time, 28 April 2007. EMAIL:  elayne.seiler@amedd.army.mil Sole Source Justification 1.  Initiating Agency and Contracting Agency      a. Initiating Agency: Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), Washington, DC      b. Contracting Agency: U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, Ft Detrick, MD 2.  Description of Action:  Approval is requested to process this request as a sole souce. 3.  Description of Acquisition:  Nanogen Nanochip 400 System. 4.  Authority Cited:  The statutory authority permitting acquisition of this requirement by other than full and open competition as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a) (2), When supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible  source ... and no other type of supplies will satisfy agency requirements.   The source, in this case, is the manufacturer.  5.  Reason for Authority Cited: FAR 6.302-1(b)(1) states, When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agencys minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.  The earliest version of the Nanogen microarray instrument, the Nanochip 100 (NC100) was purchased by the Division of Microbiology in the year 2000 to broaden the capabilities of our Biodefense research program.  The NC100 offers several unique advantages over competitors microarray instruments in that it offers multiplexing capabilities, where it can detect the presence of multiple agents in a single sample in one operation rather than multiple, repetitive operations.  In addition, all operations are carri ed out in an electronically controlled environment which speeds up sample processing and time to result.  In the past 6 years, we have worked exclusively with the NC100 developing, optimizing and testing gene detection based assays specifically for thi s instrument to evaluate its potential to detect and identify biological warfare agents in clinical and environmental samples.   A.  The recently developed, 2nd generation Nanogen, the Nanochip 400 (NC400) has many advantages over the NC100.  First, processing time of samples has been shortened as there is no desalting, or cleaning step, for assays.  Elimination of the desalting ste p also eliminates variability in the data found when different users performed the procedure. B.  The NC400 is characterized by more user-friendly features, such as increased sample throughput and faster, more efficient reaction times.    C.  Most importantly, all the assays developed on the NC100 can be easily transferred to the NC400 with n o need for re-optimization.  6.  Fair and Reasonable Price Determination: Nanogen provided a cost quote that included a customer loyalty discount as well as the transfer of our existing service contract from the old instrument to the new model after the original warranty expires. 7.  Market Research: Microarray systems developed by other manufacturers, such as Affymetrix and GeneArray, do not have the assay development flexibility of the Nanogen. Users are required to provide their own materials to the manufacturer to build arrays for them. In most cases, the assays used on these instruments are limited to gene expression rather than gene detection which continues to be the main objective of our research mission.  Additionally, we have worked for two years to optimize the assays  we've developed to work on the NC100.  Switching to a new instrument from a different manufacturer with different reagents and capabilities is like starting all over again, it would take 2 years to optimize and revalidate.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s eCLASS project needs.  The HP DL380 G5 server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: •	Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management •	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health •	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks •	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives •	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers •	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) •	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting •	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives •	Systems must have front video/USB ports •	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources •	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  These servers will be supplementing the set of HP ProLiant DL380G5 servers that are already in use at the BIMC.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>A)	Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging.

<DESC>On 16 Mar 2007, 448 CSW/PKM conducted a briefing to OUSD/DPAP regarding the CFT source selection.  This briefing went well; and OUSD/DPAP agreed to go forward to OSD/AT&L and recommend final approval of the Acquisition Plan and permission to release the formal RFP.  Since then, 448 CSW/PKM has been processing the final version of the required documents pending final decision from OSD/AT&L.  Once this decision has been received, all required documentation may be processed to obtain the required signatures to allow for the actual release of the RFP.

As of 13 Apr 2007, this meeting with OSD/AT&L has not occurred and has not been officially scheduled yet.  The meeting is "tentatively" scheduled to occur sometime in mid-May 2007.  The RFP release cannot occur until approximately 2 weeks after this meeting.

As a result, it is estimated the RFP release will not occur before early Jun 2007.  Please continue to watch WWW.FBO.GOV for further updates

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractor’s facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractor’s Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractor’s Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractor’s Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractor’s  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

<DESC>Provide boat transportation in accordance with the attached Statement of Work. The RFQ is located at Region 6 website: http://epa.gov/region6/rfq. 
EPA Region 6 is the Federal lead agency for the planning, engineering, design, and construction of two ongoing Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act (CWPPRA) barrier island restoration efforts on East and Trinity Islands of the Isles Dernieres barrier island chain.  The islands are approximately 10 miles south-southwest, by boat, from the nearest community of Cocodrie, Louisiana, in Terrebonne Parish.  The projects entail restoring beach, dune, and back barrier marsh to afford southern Louisiana communities improved storm protection and restore valuable fish and wildlife habitat.  Implementation of these two important projects requires on-site, extensive coordination with the State of Louisiana, contractors, as well as our other Federal program restoration partners (NRCS, NMFS, COE, FWS) during the planning and construction phases.  On May 9th, 2007, EPA will be responsible for transporting up to 25 interagency personnel to evaluate progress on these two restoration projects.  Given the distance to the project location, rough seas are always a possibility and safety is paramount.  We therefore are seeking to procure an operator and one vessel large enough to transport 25 interagency personnel to the project location.  This larger vessel must also be equipped with a smaller shallow draft (e.g., pontoon) boat to ferry passengers onto the barrier islands and back to the vessel, once we reach the shallower waters within sight of the islands.  We will be departing Cocodrie, LA, on May 9th at 8:30 am arriving at East and Trinity Islands at 11:00 am.  We plan to depart the islands at 2:00 pm, returning to Cocodrie at 4:00 pm the same day.  The total boat rental time would be approximately 7.5 hours.  

The vendor must be available and equipped within reasonable distance of this area of the coast, of Cocodrie, LA and capable of meeting the agency’s project needs.  Given the very remote nature of our barrier island restoration efforts and specific equipment needs for transporting up to 25 individuals to and from Cocodrie, LA, to the Isles Dernieres barrier island chain and return, it is likely the scope of possible vendors will be extremely limited.

The Hewlett Packard DL380 G5 and Hewlett Packard DL580 G4 SMART servers, along with these other components have been identified as key component of the Department’s SMART server infrastructure.  IRM ITCCB approved the use of these Hewlett Packard Servers for unclassified and classified networks.   These servers were tested by the Department for hardware and software compatibility.  These specific servers provide integrated management functions with existing equipment maximizing our return on training investment for support personnel. In addition, the various anticipated Operations and Maintenance owners of SMART deployed technologies utilize similar equipment at this time.  As the SMART program exists for a finite duration, the program seeks to minimize the burden placed on existing O&M organizations by using similar technologies as those already deployed.

<SUBJECT>99--OFFERORS SOUGHT - CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT FOR THE NEW RENO/TAHOE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER (ATCT) AND BASE BUILDING - AMENDMENT NO. 1
<SOLNBR>DTFAWP-07-R-00582
<RESPDATE>051407
<CONTACT>James Travers, (310) 725-7556
<DESC>A public announcement for this project has previously been issued.  In the interest of adequate competition for qualified vendors, the FAA is again issuing this public announcement for offerors sought and designates it as Amendment Number 1. The scope of work is to construct a new Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and Base Building with link, at the Reno/Tahoe International Airport located in Reno, NV.   The contractor must furnish and install all materials and equipment unless otherwise specified.  The contractor must construct all site utilities and install the airport control and fiber optic loop within the airport to connect the existing tower to the new facility. The ATCT is a Level 8 low activity Air Traffic Control Tower with a concrete non-functional shaft.  The ATCT has a 625 SF cab that is 175 feet above grade and a total height of approximately 195 feet.  The upper portion of the ATCT consists of a steel frame structure.  The ATCT contains a stairwell, an elevator, electrical/electronic rooms, break room, rest rooms and has four functional floors; the cab, cable access, junction and sub junction levels. The base building is approximately 10,200 SF, one story concrete structure and includes administrative areas, offices, a conference/training room, storage room and electronic equipment, telecommunication, electrical and mechanical rooms, rest-rooms with showers, locker room and break room with kitchen facilities.  The facility must comply with ADA requirements in all areas except for the tower shaft and cab. The facility includes the following building systems: a.  Security: Perimeter fencing and lighting, CCTV monitoring, entry control video, electronic card entry and parking, gate and entry points lighting. b.  The HVAC system consists of a chilled water plant (2-fully redundant air cooled chillers of approx. 120 tons capacity), heating hot water boiler (approx 70 tons capacity), chilled and heating hot water supply and return distribution piping, air handling units and distribution ductwork and exhaust fans.  The HVAC system is monitored and operated by a Direct Digital Controls system. c.  The fire protection system employs an electric fire pump, wet standpipe (in the ATCT) and wet-pipe fire-sprinkler zones.  The fire alarm system consists of heat-sensing and ionization smoke detectors, manual alarm stations, and control panels. d.  Electrical: The electrical distribution system consists of the normal, essential, and critical power systems.  Normal power is supplied by the local serving utility via a utility owned and installed transformer to the main distribution panel which, is located in the base building.  A government furnished engine-generator installed by the contractor provides essential power in case of a utility outage.  The contractor must provide the fuel oil system, including the tank and related piping.  A government furnished UPS system (fed by batteries) installed by the contractor provides critical power.     The new facility will contain 50-parking spaces, 5-handicap spaces and 10-motorcycle spaces.  The entire site will encompass approximately 206,000 SF. The FAA intends to conduct a 2-part solicitation as follows: Part 1:  Identification of qualified vendors for project.  Parties interested in being the prime contractor will be sent a Screening Information Request (SIR) package requesting the submittal of qualification and past performance information for themselves and their mechanical and electrical subcontractors.  Mechanical and electrical work is a critical element of this project.  In their response to the SIR, the prime must identify their mechanical and electrical subs (and alternates if desired).  Based on the information received, unqualified primes and their subs will be eliminated and a list of qualified vendors (for this project only) will be established.  Past performance information will be evaluated to obtain a ranking of offeror's scores.  The SIR will contain a description of the scoring method to be used.  Part 2:  Price and schedule solicitation.  A Request For Offer (RFO) package will be sent only to the firms on the list of qualified vendors.  Price and schedule will be evaluated and scored separately.  The SIR and RFO will contain a description of the scoring methods to be used.  Each offeror's scores for price, schedule and past performance will be added together to identify the offeror with the most favorable score.  A total of 100 points is possible with the relative value of scoring in descending order of importance as follows: 50 Points  --  Price 30 Points  --  Schedule 20 Points  --  Past Performance (Prime, electrical and mechanical subs.) To be deemed qualified the prime contractor must have experience with similar type projects within the past 5-years.  Similar experience includes: Structures over 75 feet high, engine generator, UPS system, chilled water system and elevator.  Not all projects need to include all elements.  Earned Value Management (EVM) will be an integral part of this project.  The prime contractor must have appropriately trained personnel capable of submitting required EVM reports.    Eight interested firms have previously been identified and are on the Offeror's List.  All 8-firms on the Offeror's List will receive notification of this amendment.  Additional firms interested in participating as the prime contractor for this project must request that they be included on the Offeror's List by contacting the Contracting Officer "in writing" no later than 1:00 PM (PST) on May 14, 2007.  VERBAL REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED.  Written requests must be addressed to Mr. James L. Travers at one of the following addresses. U.S. Mail FAA - Western Pacific Region Acquisition Section, AWP-52 P.O. Box 92007 Los Angeles, CA 90009-2007 FedEx, UPS, etc. FAA - Western Pacific Region Acquisition Section, AWP-52    15000 Aviation Blvd. Hawthorne, CA 90250 You may submit your request via facsimile at (310) 725-6842, or e-mail at james.travers@faa.gov.

Your request must include company name, mailing address, telephone and facsimile numbers, e-mail address and name of contact person. The environmental assessment for this project is not yet complete, the lease is not yet signed and funds are not presently available for this project.  While the FAA will not reimburse offerors for any costs associated with responding to this announcement, SIR or RFO, we are confident that funding will be available for award. The FAA may make an award without communications or negotiations; however, communications and/or negotiations may be conducted with one or more offeror to determine the best value to the FAA.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards Air Force Base, CA, is seeking sources to integrate an existing weather station system with three additional towers to report wind speed, wind direction, temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure.The existing Rocket Net system consists of 12 towers (54 ft.) that have specific software that was written for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) upon where this system resides. The towers use solar energy to collect and transmit data to the base station. No AC power is available at the base of any tower. The system presently uses a 900 MHz spread spectrum radio to transmit data to the base station. The system uses data loggers to collect data at tower locations. Data is received by 900 MHz antenna at the base station. It is then connected to a server which routes the data to several locations where the data is displayed at various PC stations in a windows based format.  Three additional towers shall be installed with appropriate sensors. The towers will be approximately 50 feet in height and shall be freestanding, aluminum and triangular designed towers. These three towers shall be integrated into the existing Rocket Net system. This posting is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  Responses shall be limited to 15 pages and should include, as a minimum: evidence of past experience; related projects and/or existing systems, etc; and business size.  Interested parties need to identify if they fall into one of the following categories:  large business, small business, hub zone small business, veteran owned small business, woman owned small business, or small disadvantaged business.

<DESC>This is not a request for proposals. This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.

U.S Coast Guard Water Quality Improvement System Candidates Request for Information, Opportunity for Comment.
The U.S Coast Guard (USCG) has identified a need to improve the quality of the engine wash water at the shore-based facilities where H-65C aircraft are regularly maintained.  This request for information has been issued to survey the market to identify suitable candidate systems for consideration.  The Coast Guard is seeking a uniform water filtration or distillation system for permanently installation at USCG facilities that meets or exceeds the water quality requirements detailed by the helicopter engine manufacturer, Turbomeca.  Potential suppliers are encouraged to review the attached document and provide written suggestions to the contracting officer.  

After the review of the responses to this announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the FEDBIZOPS. Responses to this sources sought are not an adequate response to any future solicitation announcement.     Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  Telephone responses will not be accepted.     Responses must be received no later than 15 May at 3 p.m. EST.  This notice is to help the USCG in refining the specification only.     All firms responding to this notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.     All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.     Responses to this synopsis are NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation. Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

The system and associated support plans will be designed to minimize Coast Guard total life cycle costs.  Additional systems may be acquired if the H-65 fleet is expanded.  



3.0	Background
The Coast Guard currently operates (97) H-65 aircraft which operate the Turbomeca Arriel 2C2CG engine.  The fleet is being expanded to 102 aircraft.  The Coast Guard is seeking to simplify logistics and reduce total ownership costs of maintaining these engines by providing the highest quality engine wash water available at the most cost-effective price across all its permanent maintenance facilities.  

The engine manufacturer recommends very strict water quality specifications, under eight (8) criteria, for regular maintenance processes.  These criteria are detailed in Attachment (1): Turbomeca Memo dated 08 April 2005.

4.0	Support
A support strategy based on water consumption rate is desired.  The support structure will be based on existing Coast Guard support contracts.  The support strategy will be included in the system procurement process.  

5.0	Vendor Qualification
The supplier must be an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or a designated representative of an original equipment manufacturer for water quality improvement systems.  

The supplier must have English-speaking technical support personnel.  All system documentation must be available in readily understandable English language format.

6.0	Evaluation
After evaluation of the information received, the Coast Guard may issue a separate request for proposals.

Selection and contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer provides the best value to the Government determined by a balanced, performance-based evaluation of system capabilities, acceptance of the government defined comprehensive support requirements, past performance, delivery and price.

The planned system evaluation criteria are: Technical Capability, Past Performance, Risk, Experience, Delivery and Price.  Proposals that exceed the basic requirements will be considered.

The evaluation and source selection process will consider each offeror's capability to provide a technical solution that best aligns with the requirements, is within the proposed schedule, and is affordably priced.  An integrated assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each offeror's proposal, together with the cost proposed, will be used to determine which proposal offers the best overall value to the Government.  


7.0	Correspondence
Correspondence regarding this statement of objectives should be sent to the following address:

The ABB ACH550 VFD is the equipment that has been used to replace all other brands of VFD's on site.  For purposes of standardization and consistency of equipment for repair parts, operational configuration and integration of subsystems to the energy management system, this is the desired replacement part.  Freeman Electronics has the equipment on the shelf and will perform the installation with no interruption to HVAC service, perform certified start up and provide 2-year parts and labor warranty.  There is no other vendor known who can perform this complete service. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy agency requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone request will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within seven (7) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information/questions must be sent to Department of Veterans Affairs; Contracting Officer (90C), Attn: Pattie C. Williams Bldg. #3, Room 209; 508 Fulton Street; Durham, NC 27705, via fax to 919-416-5986  or email to pattie.williams@va.gov. Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received the VAMC Durham will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Freeman Electronics. NAICS 238220

Though many test facilities currently exist, there presently is no approved Class HI shock test facility at any test facility that can safely test fire new Guided Munitions because of their need for an extremely large safety fan for early testing on immature guided rounds.  Therefore, fabrication of a machine to be placed on a military installation which can support the test is necessary.  Hi-Test is currently the only approved fabricator of this equipment which meets BUSHIPS Drawing 10-T-2145-L and can be certified by the Navy. The period of performance is for 6 to 8 weeks after date of contract, with an estimated cost not to exceed $200k.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  See Note 22.  No formal solicitation package is available.  The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in responding to this notice, and all responses must be received within thirty (30) days of this posting.  Only e-mail inquiries will be accepted—no telephonic communications.     POC: Margot Haycook (703) 432-4081

<SUBJECT>70 -- Brand Name Justification for Cisco Router Products
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure  “brand name” Cisco router products to support existing Cisco hardware infrastructure that is installed and in production for the USPTO’s automated information systems (AISs).  This announcement is considered a “brand name” justification.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). The acquisition will be conducted utilizing existing Blanket Purchase Agreements for Information Technology products within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.   Cisco networks hardware is the USPTO’s established standard based commercial product for its AISs in accordance with the USPTO’s Technical Reference Model (TRM).   It is essential that the USPTO acquire Cisco router products to maintain the continuity of the network traffic and business processes and maintain compatibility. In addition, purchase of the same Cisco hardware will reduce and/or share the cost of spares with other network projects, and reduce the maintenance cost by not having to maintain different similar functioning products.  Purchase of different hardware will require additional engineering design and training, component testing, system testing, etc. to ensure reliability and compatibility testing which will delay the mission critical project time and increase the costs beyond the budget limits.  If you have questions regarding this notice, they may be addressed by email to Sylvia Van Dyke at Sylvia.VanDyke@uspto.gov.

Other Defense Agencies, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Contracts Management Office, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA, 22203-1714, UNITED STATES

DESCRIPTION

DARPA seeks information from qualified organizations describing their ability to collect and fuse light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor and color electro-optical (EO) data in support of the URGENT program.  Interested organizations who respond to this RFI may be invited to brief the government on their capabilities at a series of government-only briefings to be held Tuesday, 8 May 2007, at DARPA in Arlington, Virginia.

BACKGROUND 

The objective of the Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology (URGENT) program is to develop a 3D urban object recognition and exploitation system that enables advanced mission planning and situation analysis capabilities for the warfighter operating in urban environments.  DARPA/IXO has solicited proposals for URGENT Phase 1, which focuses on the development of novel and innovative approaches to urban object recognition from light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor and electro-optical (EO).  Specifically, URGENT?s objective is the recognition of 150 unique urban objects as detailed in http://dtsn.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations.asp#0713.  This RFI requests information from qualified organizations on their ability to perform data collection in support of the URGENT program.

URGENT will perform exploitation of 2D/3D data acquired by one or more collection systems over an urban region.  Each URGENT data set will consist of (1) airborne LIDAR and color EO data, and (2) ground based LIDAR and color EO data.  The data will be provided with the respective airborne and terrestrial LIDAR and EO data registered, and with the airborne and terrestrial collections registered.  The government anticipates up to three URGENT data collections will occur during Phase 1 of the URGENT program in order to provide URGENT performers with data that includes examples of all objects in the URGENT 150 objects of interest list under a with a variety of conditions and view angles.  While the size of the region may vary with different collection scenarios, URGENT?s collection area will typically be between 1 to 5 square kilometers. 

The spatial sampling densities for ground and airborne LIDAR sources will range from 3 centimeter to 30 centimeter Independent Post Spacing.  Airborne color EO data will be collected at 15 centimeter resolution while terrestrial color EO data will be collected at 5 centimeter resolution.  The 3D LIDAR data will be provided as point cloud data sets in compressed ASCII format consisting of ordered quadruplets of Northing, Easting, Elevation, and Uncalibrated Intensity referenced to the WGS-84 coordinate frame. 

Note that airborne LIDAR collected under the URGENT program may be labeled as FOUO (For Official Use Only).  FOUO URGENT data must be protected by recipients to prevent disclosure.  Servers providing access to FOUO data will use encrypted methods of communication to access that data.  No FOUO URGENT data will be allowed on public web or anonymous FTP servers.  All CDs or DVDs containing FOUO URGENT data must be labeled as FOUO.

INFORMATION SOUGHT 

This is a request for information in the form of a technical briefing on available LIDAR and color EO collection platforms applicable to URGENT data collection requirements.  DARPA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the URGENT transition partner, intend to host a series of government-only briefings by interested organizations on 8 May 2007.  Depending upon the number of responses to this RFI, organizations will be provided 45 or more minutes to present their capabilities to:

[1] collect and register terrestrial LIDAR and color EO sensor data;
[2] collect and register airborne LIDAR and color EO sensor data;
[3] register airborne LIDAR and EO data with terrestrial LIDAR and EO data; and 
[4] provide meta data for all collected sensor data.

At a minimum, the data will be provided as X-Y-Z-R-G-B point clouds but additional data standard formats may also be provided.  Both the original data in the sensors' coordinate systems and the point-by-point mapping of these data from the sensor coordinate system to the registered data coordinate system should be provided.

Meta data provided should include sensor orientations, noise statistics, GPS position and time, pulse count, pulse intensity, and calibrated pulse range.  Airborne collected data sets should also include aircraft roll, pitch, heading and position. 

INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS 

DARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources, including but not limited to, universities, university affiliated research centers, federally-funded research centers, private or public companies, and Government research laboratories.  Organizations interested in presenting should submit the following information as a Microsoft Word file by email to SN07-31@darapa.mil:

<SUBJECT>B -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT.  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT IS TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT FOR THE NOAA NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE-NATIONAL MARINE MAMMAL LABORATORY (NMML).  UNDER PROPOSED CONTRACT, VENDOR WILL CONDUCT ONGOING STUDIES TO INVESTIGATE REASONS FOR THE DECLINE OF NORTHERN FUR SEALS IN ALASKA.  NORTHERN FUR SEALS ARE LISTED AS ?DEPLETED? IN U.S. WATERS UNDER THE MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION ACT OF 1972.  BIENNIAL COUNTS OF SEAL PUPS ON THE PRIBILOF ISLANDS INDICATE THAT THE POPULATION DECREASED AT APPROXIMATELY 5.8% PER YEAR BETWEEN 1998-2004.  THE SMALL POPULATION ON BOGOSLOF ISLAND HAS INCREASED AT A RATE OF 12% PER YEAR BETWEEN 1997-2005.  REASONS FOR THE DECLINE ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD.  THE TRENDS OF THESE TWO POPULATIONS SUGGEST THAT THE FACTORS LIMITING POPULATION STABILITY ON THE PRIBILOF ISLANDS MAY NOT BE PRSENT ON BOGOSLOF AND/OR THAT THE FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF ANIMALS FROM EACH AREA MAY BE DIFFERENT.  NMML INITIATED A COMPLEX RESEARCH PROGRAM TO INVESTIGATE THE WINTER BEHAVIOR OF NEWLY WEANED FUR SEAL PUPS.  THIS PROJECT INVOLVED THE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS DEPLOYMENT OF 99 SATELLITE-LINKED TELEMETRY DEVICES FROM FOUR DIFFERENT ISLANDS IN THE NORTH PACIFIC AND BERING SEAS TO RECORD AND COMPARE THE MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF FUR SEAL PUPS FROM ALL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN ROOKERIES.  DOCUMENTING THE WINTER MIGRATIONS WILL HELP NMML MANAGERS UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS THAT MAY BE ACTING ON THE FUR SEAL POPULATION DURING THEIR MOST VULNERABLE LIFE STAGE.  PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE:  1) DETERMINE MIGRATORY MOVEMENTS AND WINTER DESTINATIONS OF FUR SEALS IN THEIR FIRST YEAR AT SEA; 2) INTERPRET THE FORAGING ACTIVITY OF THIS AGE CLASS USING DIVE DATA AND ACTIVITY PATTERNS; 3) EXAMINE THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCING THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF MIGRATION AND FORAGING WITHIN AND BETWEEN YEARS; AND 4) EXAMINE ISLAND AND COLONY EFFECTS ON MIGRATION.  DR. MARY ANN LEA ANALYZED THE TELEMETRY DATA OBTAINED FROM FUR SEAL PUPS DURING THE WINTERS OF 2005, 2006, AND 2007.  FURTHER, THE CONTRACTOR COMPLETED PH.D STUDYING FORAGING ACTIVITY OF ANTARCTIC FUR SEALS IN RELATION TO OCEANOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS AND WAS AWARDED A NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP TO LEAD THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS PROJECT DESCRIBED ABOVE.  FOR THIS REASON, NOAA BELIEVES PROPOSED CONTRACTOR THE ONLY SOURCE THAT CAN COMPLETE THIS STUDY.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE IS FOR 18 MONTHS FROM DATE OF AWARD.  
THE PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. HOWEVER, ALL PROPOSALS RECEIVED WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS SYNOPSIS WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF LESS THAN $100,000.

As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed $100,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials.  The FAR requires that the contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing.  To fulfill this requirement, VA uses an online database, the Contractor Performance System (CPS), which is maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The CPS database information is shared with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies.  You are required to register with the NIH CPS database at the following web address:  CPS - https://cpscontractor.nih.gov.  Further, your registered representative data, as well as any other information in your registration data, must be kept current.  Performance evaluations entered into CPS by the contracting officer will be assigned to the contractor's registered representative for comment.  Failure to comment and reassign the report back to the contracting officer, or to maintain current registration, will result in the Government's evaluation being entered in the database with a statement that you have failed to respond.  Help in registering can be obtained by contacting CPS Support E-mail (cps-support-1@list.nih.gov) or by calling (301) 451-2771.  Pursuant to FAR Clause 52.212-4, para (t), Central Contractor Registration (CCR), after initial registration, the contractor is required to update registration data as changes occur and must re-register annually to ensure all data remains current.  Noncompliance with this requirement will preclude the exercising of any option periods that may be included herein and will be cause for termination of the contract at such time noncompliance is discovered.  Refer to cited Clause for more details.  You are required to register with the CCR database at the following web address:  CCR - http://www.ccr.gov.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU COMPLETE THESE REGISTRATIONS IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED FOR CONTRACT AWARD.  AWARD CANNOT BE MADE TO A CONTRACTOR NOT REGISTERED IN BOTH OF THESE DATABASE SYSTEMS.

This document incorporates Provisions and Clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-12. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 315299 and the Small Business Size Standard is 5 00.  The Government anticipates awarding a single Firm-Fixed-Price Requirements type contract with a base year and four option years.  The base year shall include an initial order multiple CLINs for an estimated total quantity of 63,000 NAPPs (LWH 42,600 L G/XL and 17,400 XS/SM/MD; MICH helmets 2,310 LG/XL and 690 SM/MD) on or about the time the contract is awarded. The ordering period shall remain in effect for 12 months from date of contract award. Each ordering period shall have a minimum ordering require ment od 10,000 units and a maximum ordering requirement of 200,000 units. The designated Government activity for this contract is the United States Marine Corps (USMC).  The contract will be issued by the U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick Contrac ting Division, Natick, MA on behalf of the USMC.  This contract will not apply to elements of the U.S. Army or other elements of the U.S. Government; however, this does not preclude the ordering of NAPPs for organizations other than the USMC.  The provisio n at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial applies to this acquisition, addenda to include the following: Offerors shall hold the prices in its offer firm for 60 days.  Delivery shall be F.O.B. Destination and Inspection and Acceptance shall be at Destination by the cognizant receiving authority.  The contractor may assume that approximately equal quantities, based on the estimated quantity, will be shipped to the following locations: Okinawa, Japan; Camp Lejeune, NC 28542; Camp Pendleton, CA 92055. Deliveries will begin within 45 days after issuance of delivery order and shall be at a monthly rate of 10,000 units per month within 90 days after receipt of ord er.  The contractor will not be required to deliver in excess of 10,000 items per month irrespective of the number of orders received.  Offerors are required to submit 6 Product Samples for each model and size proposed with their proposal. The Government w ill not return any samples submitted. Offerors must also demonstrate satisfactory ballistic performance by either submitting test data from an NIJ certified test laboratory and/or documentation that the proposed ballistic solution has already completed a c ontract first article testing (FAT) in accordance with CO/PD 00-02. Alternatively, if no test data exists, the contractor shall submit a quantity of 18 15-inch square shootpack samples of the proposed ballistic solution for government testing in accordance  with CO/PD 00-02G. The offeror shall submit a written proposal limited to 15 pages that includes a detailed description of the proposed solution(s) which explains how their proposal meets or exceeds each of the salient charactersitcs above. It will also i nclude a description of their facilities, equipment and personnel that will be utilized for this effort, which provides convincing evidence that the offeror can produce the required quantities within the required schedule.  Offerors shall provide the unit price for the estimated quantity and describe any economic pricing with their proposal. Should the Government issue delivery orders within 60 days of each other and final delivery has not occurred, the delivery order will be issued reflecting the economic quantity pricing for the total quantity of all relevant delivery orders.  All affected delivery orders will be subsequently modified to reflect the lower economic quantity pricing.  Offerors are encouraged to provide pricing for economic order quantities ( i.e. 1 to 3,000; 3,001 to 6,000, etc.).  The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the proposed prices relative to any economic ordering quantities are materially unbalanced. Unbalanced economic ordering pricing exists when, despite a n acceptable total evaluated price, the unit discount pricing is significantly understated or overstated as indicated by the application of price analysis techniques.  A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balanc e poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.  The Government anticipates placing a delivery order for 63,000 NAPPs upon award of the contract; however, this does not commit the Government to placing such an order upon contract award.

The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the current baseline products – however, to support more users, additional licenses and support is needed. Microstrategy software is the basis for measuring the performance of ILMS. The software and support services needed to accomplish this task in ILMS include: MicroStrategy WebReporter, MicroStrategy Office, MicroStrategy Web Professional, MicroStrategy Intelligence Server, MicroStrategy Report Services, MicroStrategy OLAP Services, MicroStrategy SDK, and MicroStrategy Bronze Technical Support A full description of the software and support services that are required can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for MicroStrategy.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the MicroStrategy software, the required software and support is available only from MicroStrategy. The software and support described in paragraph 3 is crucial for measuring the performance of ILMS. ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the MicroStrategy software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure software and support from MicroStrategy would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the ability to measure the performance of ILMS.<BR><BR>

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:   

The intent of this competitive solicitation is to select multiple firms to perform plumbing, mechanical, and electrical, General Contractor discipline construction work and minor design services for various Indian Health Service Facilities in New Mexico as needed.

Phase I will be a competitive evaluation of the firms past performance history and qualifications. Each of these firms will be evaluated and rated and ranked by a source selection board. Up to five firms may be selected and requested to participate in Phase II.   

Phase II will be for the seed project and will involve minor design and may include, utilities and other infrastructure, mechanical engineering for building plumbing and HVAC systems, electrical engineering for building systems and site lighting, and any and all other incidental architectural and engineering tasks as required for a complete project.

The Indian Health Service will provide minimum specification and drawing packages to the selected contractors which shall be used as minimum requirements. The contractor’s will be required to design a complete building package providing the most amenities possible within the budgeted funds available conforming to the drawings and specification.  The estimated project size is in excess of $100,000.00 dollars for both design and construction. Some projects may be higher limits and some projects may be lower limits. Not all projects will require design efforts.  Pricing will be established as designing within fee limitations and the final construction lump sum price will be negotiated.  

Award of the seed project will be made to one firm whose proposal, conforming to the requirements is determined to offer the best value to the Government, price, technical factors, and past performance considered.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price offeror. 

As the need develops, each of the five firms will be issued minimum plans and specifications and requested to submit a technical and price proposal. Again, award will be made to the offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to offer the best value to the Government, price, technical factors, and past performance considered.

Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the proposed contract.  Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussion.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.
