This is NOT an invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract.  However, potential sources that may be interested in this competitive process are requested to mail, fax, or e-mail their interest to the contact address by October 15, 2004.  The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) plans to support a program that seeks to help Bolivia take advantage of trade opportunities, prepare for participation in trade agreements and improve trade capacity and competitiveness overall.

The second phase of USAID’s Bolivian Trade and Business Competitiveness (BTBC 2) activity will involve broader and longer-term interventions than the initial phase and will be a fully-competed, four-year contract with a total estimated budget within the cost range of $15,000,000 (fifteen million US Dollars) and $20,000,000 (twenty-million U.S. Dollars) plus $550,000 (five-hundred and fifty thousand) in local currency funds.  BTBC 2 follows an initial 2-year program that concentrated on the implementation of discrete, priority activities to help Bolivia with respect to immediate trade-related challenges, including taking advantage of trade preferences under the Andean Trade Preferences and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) and preparation for participation in trade agreements.  

We anticipate issuing the RFP 511-05-001 o/a October 15, 2004.  The due date for proposals is anticipated to be November 30, 2004.  USAID/Bolivia does not intend to conduct a Pre-proposal Conference.

If this limitation is subsequently determined to apply, the Government shall have the unilateral right to restructure this contract.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture with the modernization of the Potter Stewart U.S. Courthouse. Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services and preparation of design documents are required for this renovation project. The 9-story Courthouse, located at 5th and Walnut Street, in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, was completed in 1939. The estimated total construction cost for the project is approximately $30,000,000 to $40,000,000.

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work. A/E firm, as used in this RFQ, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project concept and design documents. The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept.

The project scope of work consists of the cleaning and repair of exterior walls, replacement and/or restoration of the historic façade and light court windows, and the replacement of the roof over the 9th floor. The project will require the removal of the cooling towers, chillers and associated pumps, and tanks as well as the replacement of the boilers. An emergency generator will be installed with this project and the existing sprinkler system will be extended throughout the remaining unsprinkled areas of the building. The defunct air handling unit (AHU) and associated ductwork in the basement will be removed. Included with the project is the abatement of any asbestos found during the demolition of the boilers, cooling towers, chillers and pumps. The project includes the renovation of two freight elevators, the replacement of generators and the modernization of the motors on 8 passenger and one freight elevators. The lighting levels in two level 8 courtrooms will be improved along with the addition of a new courtroom on the 1st floor and new chambers on the 2nd floor. A satellite Office for the U.S. Attorney and a Grand Jury Suite will be added as well as lobby and corridor renovations. Repairs to the exterior include the structural steel at the east ramp area, the exterior areaway, stair landings and sidewalks. Interior vestibule doors will be replaced to match the original historical doors. A new AHU will be added to the 1st floor courtroom with the addition of Direct Digital Controls (DDC) to the AHU in the Marshal’s spaces. Increased security will require the addition of motion sensors and security card access devices to the judges’ chamber doors. The restrooms will be brought up to Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS). Tenant and common area signage will be upgraded with Braille. This work will all take place during evening hours and will require precise phasing so as not to disrupt the daily workings of the Courts. Also as part of the HVAC improvements, efforts will be undertaken to make this building LEED certified for sustainability, accessibility, and energy efficiency. 

The design A/E selected under this solicitation will design the planned modernization and renovation as described including at a minimum: site and system verification, analysis of previous investigative reports, tenant programming and space design, design concepts, design development, construction documentation, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering, partnering and Post Construction Contract Services (PCCS).  The scope may include: presentation to the national historic officials for approval; coordination of previous analysis and work performed at the Potter Stewart Courthouse; review, documentation, and discussion with the CMc team to ensure a smooth and complete transition of the desired design direction; and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government.  This project will be designed following GSA’s “Facility Standards for the Public Building Service”, the U.S. Courts Design Guide, the U. S. Marshal’s “Requirements and Specifications for Special Purpose and Support Space Manuals”, as well as any other affected tenant-agency’s security requirements.  This project will be designed to meet GSA energy goals and include sustainable design and construction practices using the LEED system as a guide.  

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:

STAGE I:    The first stage will establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and their Lead Designer. From the first stage, a minimum of three (3) A/E Design Firms will be selected for continuation into the stage two interviews. The short list will be based on the A/E Design Firm’s submittal in response to this Request for Qualifications.  The A/E Design Firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver Design Excellence within a historic structure and will express its design approach and philosophy. In Stage 1, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 inch format. The portfolio should include the following:  1. A cover letter referencing this FBO announcement and a brief description of the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; 2. The Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) modified to include only the information requested in this RFQ for Stage I. Identification of consultants is not required at this stage. Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria:

(1)      PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%):    The A/E Design Firm shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of projects completed within the past ten years.    Submit NO MORE THAN five (5) relevant projects. The firms responding shall clearly demonstrate competence in exterior building repairs, HVAC renovation, fire alarm replacement, and development of phasing plans for occupied facilities, and sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century buildings. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how the historic preservation and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.    

(2)      LEAD DESIGNER’S PORTFOLIO (25%):    The Lead Designer shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of three (3) relevant projects each completed within the last ten years directly attributable to the Lead Designer. Narrative shall include a discussion of design challenges and solutions and be a good indicator of how well the Lead Designer worked with a sensitive and important client. The sample relevant projects shall clearly demonstrate sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century heritage buildings. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how historic preservation (if any) and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.

(3)      PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%):    In the Lead Designer’s words (maximum of two written pages), state his/her overall design philosophy, approach to the challenge of resolving historic preservation issues, and parameters that may apply specifically to the renovation and repair of mid-20th century heritage buildings. Also, discuss how design and the coordination of complex multiphase construction in occupied office space may affect their approach and design process. Include a discussion on how they would approach renovation work in sensitive, symbolic and secured spaces as found in the Federal agency spaces and judicial courtrooms and chambers.

(4)      LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (15%):    Submit a biographical sketch including education, professional experience and recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.  

For each reference project, provide a contact including name, title, address, phone and fax numbers.  

STAGE II:    For Stage II, the short listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. In this stage, the entire project team will be evaluated. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) including consultant information. An interview with each project team will be included in this stage.  During the interviews, A/E firms should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation criteria and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, professional qualifications, and team organization and management plan. The Government will establish the detailed stage II evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due. A brief period, approximately three weeks, will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team. In developing the Stage II team, A/E firms are advised that they will be evaluated on whether at least 35% of the design effort will be within the designated geographical area of the State of Ohio.  Any arrangement toward this goal must be in place prior to the submittal of Stage II information.

This procurement is open to all business concerns. In accordance with 15 USC 631 et seq., the selected A/E firm will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-owned, small disadvantaged, and service disabled veteran owned businesses. The use of subcontractors/consultants shown in the SF 330 must be reflected in a subcontracting plan which will be included in the contract. The detailed plan should be submitted with the SF330 in Stage II. The small business size standard for this procurement under NAICS code 541310 is $4,000,000 based on average annual receipts for the preceding three (3) years. Contact your local SBA office for further information. Firms seeking consideration for this contact shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest subcontracting goals possible. An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract. Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.

<SOLNBR>HSHQPA-04-X-00344
<RESPDATE>102504
<ARCHDATE>11082004
<CONTACT>Charlotte Rupprecht, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-5856, Fax 202-254-6167, Email Charlotte.Rupprecht@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in projects offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerates the prototyping and development of technologies that
reduce homeland vulnerabilities. HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperatives agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities.

The emergency responder community has a need to acquire, synthesize, communicate and share critical information. These abilities are key elements in an effective response to
any emergency situation. This need has become more critical as the emergency responder community prepares to employ more coordinated responses to emergency situations and
new terrorist threats facing our nation. It is crucial to ensure that all information flowing into and out of the focal point of incident command is managed properly to ensure optimal use in supporting command and control and decision support.
This BAA seeks proposals to develop an innovative new architecture to support the information management and sharing requirements of the emergency responder community. After the completion of these studies, HSARPA anticipates competing and
funding a follow-on program to develop and field test technologies and systems which are found to be most advantageous during the architecture study phase.

The ability to manage personnel, direct equipment, and seamlessly communicate, gather, store, redistribute, and secure any mission critical information needed by incident
commanders and emergency responders during an emergency situation defines Unified Incident Command & Decision Support (UICDS). At present, the emergency responder community, composed of law enforcement, fire departments, emergency medical teams,
chemical weapons response teams, radiation and nuclear specialist, etc. have had limited success in the area of coordinated response due to inadequate, insecure, and incompatible training tools and information technologies. The full capabilities of information management technologies should be brought to bear on behalf of the emergency responder community in the form of a system that allows incident commanders and emergency responders to manage the flow of data, voice, and video information in addition to other forms of information. The very nature of emergency situations and the
complexity and volume of information flowing into and out of incident command positions demand a more integrated information management architecture. UICDS systems based on this highly interconnected and integrated architecture should meet the
needs of the entire emergency responder community and its design should allow for integration, when needed, between local, state, and federal information management,situation awareness and C4ISR systems. The integration of individual local, state, and/or
federal information management systems should create an interconnected, information sharing ‘network of networks’ whose overall capabilities are greater than the sum of its
individual parts.

The research, development, and launch of a UICDS information management system is crucial to the future operations of incident commanders and emergency responders. The goal of this BAA is to harness innovative ideas in an effort to create an information management and sharing architecture specifically designed to meet the needs of incident commanders and emergency responders throughout the nation and realize a robust, fully
functional UICDS information management system to enhance the safety and effectiveness of this nation’s emergency responder community.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) and associated orders to North Star Scientific Corporation (NSS), Kapolei, HI, 96707, to procure radar transmitter WRA upgrades for the E-2C aircraft and associated efforts as may be necessary to accomplish this work. This action will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements), as NAVAIR believes that only NSS possesses the knowledge, experience, and patent pending technical data and design drawings necessary for a HEATx RF module type design required for the radar transmitter WRA upgrades that will provide a 500% increase in “Mean Time Between Failure” and a 50% reduction in life cycle costs, while maintaining E-2C radar band-width and power requirements, and as such is the only firm with the requisite knowledge and technical data and expertise necessary for this effort. The Primary POC is Deborah Flaherty, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-757-7030, Fax 301-757-7054, email Deborah.Flaherty@navy.mil.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR-Orlando) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQ) with The Boeing Company, St. Louis, MO. (Boeing) under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  The anticipated ceiling amount for this contract is $500M.  As the design cognizant activity and builder of the in production F/A-18 E/F Aircraft and EA-18G variant, Boeing alone maintains the engineering expertise required to design, build and deliver high fidelity F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers to meet critical aircrew and maintainers training requirements that occur concurrently with the introduction of the aircraft into the fleet.  The Boeing Company through their Flight Simulation division is funded by the F/A-18 E/F Aircraft and EA-18G Programs to create aircraft systems software and modify aircraft Software Configuration Sets (SCS) for engineering simulations at Boeing that are used in the development of the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G aircraft.  These newly created and modified SCS software models are then reused in the development of F/A-18 E/F trainer systems.  They will also be used in the newly developed EA-18G trainer systems.  As part of the aircraft procurement program, Boeing developed and built the existing F/A-18 E/F Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers and are currently responsible for design, fabrication, integration, documentation, shipping, installation and testing of upgrades to specific trainers.  Under the EA-18G Aircraft Program, Boeing will mirror this effort and build EA-18G Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers.  This sole source acquisition will be for the procurement of new F/A-18E/F and EA-18G trainers and training systems and upgrades to existing trainers and training systems.  The training systems’ requirements include incorporation of all ongoing aircraft engineering change proposals (ECPs), SCS updates, (to include, but not limited to H3, H4, H5, H6) and incorporation of major subsystems identified in the aircraft development roadmap that impact aircrew and maintenance training.  The trainers and training associated with the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft is designed and developed based on data derived from parallel and spiral efforts contracted with Boeing under the aircraft procurement programs.  The trainers will require incorporation of advanced and emerging technologies specific in design or application to the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G aircraft.  F/A-18 E/F trainers and EA-18G trainers require the use of technical and operational information that is not readily available to other vendors during design and development.  Only Boeing has access to the requisite aircraft design data, aircraft specific software, and simulated models.  Because the contract requires in-depth knowledge of the current and future aircraft designs, award through competition would require substantial duplication of costs that the Government would not recover through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G's mission training requirements scheduled through FY10.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, and any other information, which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Tim Cichon (timothy.cichon@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2000, no later than 21 October 2004.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than FIVE (5) pages.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available.  If no affirmative written response is received, the ID/IQ Contract for the F/A-18E/F  and EA-18G Aircrew and Maintenance Trainers and trainer modifications  will be awarded without further notice.

<DESC>NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) has a requirement for a quantity of three (3) HDTVxpress boards with 4:2:2 microcode;  Additional Microcode to support 4:2:0/24p capture; Application Software API + Source code; and 30 days of limited phone/email support.  The NASA Space Video Gateway (SVG) Project is tasked with providing High Definition Television (HDTV) and Standard Definition Television (SDTV) MPEG2 motion picture data streams of up to 30 Megabits per second to be transmitted to the ground via the Orbiter Communications Adapter (OCA) and the Station communications system.  The source for this video will be a high definition camera with HD-SDI outputs.  This project requires that space and the weight of the equipment be minimized, while providing the envelope pushing performance required by high definition television.  It is required that the SVG be stowed in the Shuttle mid-deck or Multi-purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) for launch and return.   The driving issues for this hardware element are the combination of form factor, power supply voltage, and computational power.  The HDExpress Card will be used in the SVG system to convert the HD-SDI raw high definition digital data stream, which was produced by the high definition camera, to DVB-ASI, which is a compressed MPEG2 data stream. NASA/JSC intends to purchase these items from LSI Logic Corporation in Houston, TX, as the only source offering this unique unit.  An extensive Market Survey was conducted via internet search and discussions with numerous HDTV Encoder manufacturers.  In this survey, LSI Logic was the only manufacturer that was found that offers a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) HDTV Encoder that meets the fundamental requirements needed for this application.  The driving issues for this hardware element were the combination of form factor and HD-SDI Signal Format and Encoding Scheme.  The project requires a PCI Card Format Factor to fit within the intended computer chassis.	The project also requires HD-SDI inputs in the 720p, 1080i and 1080p formats be accepted and translated into DVB-ASI.  Finally, the project requires encoding to be performed using 4:2:2.	 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 10/19/04. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>USFS Rd 99 is a two-lane asphalt surfaced road that provides public access to the Northeast corner of Mt St Helens.  Embankment settlement has left the outside lane unsafe for public use.  This project will excavate unstable embankment material to a depth of 5 feet (1.52 meters) below the top of the existing asphalt surface and reconstruct the embankment to the original grade.  The new embankments will be topped with a lift of crushed rock and a lift of hot asphalt concrete plant mix.  Other minor excavation is required.  All excavated materials will be hauled to a USFS administered disposal area and placed in a stable pile.  Embankments will be constructed of Crushed Aggregate produced by the Contractor utilizing a Government provided material source.  Embankments will be topped utilizing Government furnished crushed rock that is stockpiled in the Government provided material source.  Three other sites will require the removal and replacement of existing guardrail, posts and terminal end sections.

	The construction and removal of a structure to provide a water source for compaction of gravel and embankments must meet the requirements of the Jan 2003 MOU between the Wash State Dept of Fish and Wildlife and the USDS FS PNW.  See Section J for the provision relative water diversion.

Note:  Due to Spotted Owl restrictions there will be no activity in Big Creek Quarry between March 1 and June 30.

Currently the 99 Rd is closed to public access from Cascade Peak to Windy Ridge.  Work area at milepost 14 is currently not accessible to public.  Access to these areas will be updated as the information becomes available to us.  Please check the Gifford Pinchot National Forest Website for current information.  http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/

Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the  authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allows for negotiation without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source.

The University of South Florida is the only available source that can supply researchers that possess unique expertise and  extensive experience analyzing neurotoxicity screening data, dose-response modeling, and benchmark dose computation and software development. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the  requirement by submitting documentation to Kimberli Irwin at the office identified above, by fax (513)487-2109 or by e-mail (irwin.kimberli@epa.gov) which establishes that their specifications meet the EPA's requirement.  Documentation must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of  publication of this synopsis to be considered by the EPA.  A determination by the EPA not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining  whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See note 22.

<DESC>1. Introduction.    

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is considering the introduction of state of the art Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Governance Software products to support the publication of Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) and Core Enterprise Services (CES) including but not limited to: application, collaboration, messaging, discovery, storage, content staging, enterprise service management, and security on the Global Information Grid (GIG) infrastructure.  

DISA is seeking information from industry on state of the art SOA Governance Software products capable of supporting the publication of all NCES and CES, which include but are not limited to application, collaboration, messaging, discovery, storage, content staging, enterprise service management, and security to ensure that DISA has considered all available commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products that provide this capability.  This Request for Information (RFI) includes but is not limited to: SOA Governance Software products which include but are not limited to: Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Web Service Description Language (WSDL), etc… analysis and compliance checking, policies, best practices, management tools, metrics, etc.  All software manufacturers and suppliers of SOA Governance software are offered this opportunity to provide their product information to DISA for review, analysis and consideration as an SOA Governance tool for the GIG NCES and CES architecture.

In order to ensure continued operations, reduce integration costs and complexities, limit liability and security exposure, and effectively complete all missions DISA requires a software mechanism to help govern the design, development, deployment, and operations of all services for the GIG NCES and CES architecture.

2. Background.

SOA Governance is the ability to ensure that all design, development, deployment, and operation of services meet enterprise SOA Governance capabilities.  Several elements must be in place in order to achieve SOA Governance:

2.1. SOA Enterprise Policies:

SOA policies are the cornerstone of SOA Governance. Without policies there is no Governance.  Policies are the set of goals, which direct and measure success.  Policy Makers including CTO’s, CIO’s, Managers, Architects, Project Leaders, and Enterprise Application development leaders are struggling to define, configure, and assign enterprise polices in a way which allows development teams to easily and transparently adhere to new policies.  In addition, policies need to be addressed based on the business impact to the operations, and also the reliability required of the services created.  SOA Governance policies are an evolving entity.  As infrastructures change with new technologies, standards, services, business processes, and clients new policies will need to be created and old policies will need to be changed or retired.

2.2. Auditing and Conformance:

Developers, Architects, and Project Teams need the ability to conform to enterprise policies through an automated system that provides them with easy methods to capture requirements, recommendations, and best practices in their language. A set of software components that enables them to detect, analyze, and audit compliance with enterprise policies transparently by integrating with the Service Development Life-Cycle (SDLC) as well as with other operational processes.

2.3. Integration:

When policies are defined and conformance processes are in place SOA Governance is realized.  Decision makers shall govern implementation, encourage reusability, manage collaboration processes, and improve business metrics.  These are the value added aspects of integration.

The integration of SOA Governance has two aspects:

2.3.1. Process Integration – has to be integrated with the current flow of enterprise development and with the tools and systems available in order to keep service implementations in conformance with enterprise policies through the design, development, testing, implementation, deployment, and maintenance phases. 

2.3.2. System Integration – needs to be integration capable with Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), development tools, and other enterprise applications that are producing services in a transparent manner.  Conformance should be transparent and simple for the teams in the field.

3. Requirements/Capabilities:

SOA Governance software represents a change in the way services shall be developed and deployed on the GIG NCES and CES architecture.  DISA shall change from “Develop now, Integrate later” to a “Develop for Integration” paradigm.  The new paradigm, combined with the technologies and standards created to support the paradigm shift shall help DISA implement SOA Governance efficiently and effectively.

3.1. SOA Governance software products will be categorized using the following classification (these are listed in preferred order of priority):

3.1.1. Current state of the art SOA Governance software in use today.  As used here, current refers to software that is installed and operational for at least one customer.

3.1.2. Imminent release SOA Governance software available today, but not necessarily fielded in an operational network to date.

3.1.3. Announced SOA Governance software products and other forward-looking statements or documents. 

3.2. The SOA Governance Software shall have, but not be limited to, the following:

3.2.1. An existing database of current policies and best practices from which to choose.

3.2.2. The capability to add, modify, delete policies and best practices.

3.2.3. Extensible Markup Language (XML) schema, Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Web Service Description Language (WSDL), etc… analysis, compliance checking and error correction feedback.

3.2.4. A management tool with the capability to display performance metrics.

3.2.5. Enforce conformance to the policies selected.

3.2.6. Conform to accepted application program interfaces (API).

3.2.7. Scalable, Portable, Adaptable, etc…

3.2.8. The capability to govern a single Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) register and multiple distributed UDDI registries.  

3.2.9. Be easy to use, fully automated and transparent to the users.
 
3.2.10. Not be system resource intensive or intrusive.

3.2.11. The capability to grant policy control to individuals, groups, domains, etc… and be overridden automatically.
 
3.2.12. Identify policies and best practices for development guidance for the enterprise.

3.2.13. Identify interfaces that are not compliant.

3.2.14. Identify services in use or those that exist within the enterprise.

3.2.15. Identify reusable services and interface components.

3.2.16. Identify changed and new policies.

3.2.17. Collect information on each UDDI registry independently and combine the data creating an enterprise view.

3.2.18. Display a global view of the enterprise by organization and function.

3.2.19. Generate and grant exceptions to policies.

4. Definitions.  The following definitions are provided:

A. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA): A system for linking resources on demand. In an SOA, resources are made available to other participants in the network as independent services that are accessed in a standardized way. This provides for more flexible loose coupling of resources than in traditional systems architectures.

B. Governance: Governance of services is the institutional framework in which the integrity of a service interaction or set of related service interactions is decided. The term therefore refers to the set of laws, procedures and common practices that determine the ability of exchange partners to take decisions with respect to their exchange relationship. The system and structure for defining policy, providing leadership, and managing and coordinating the procedures and resources that ensure the quality of all software application services in a service oriented architecture enterprise. 

C. Auditing: A service that reliably and securely records security-related events producing an audit trail enabling the reconstruction and examination of a sequence of events. Security events could include authentication events, policy enforcement decisions, and others. The resulting audit trail may be used to detect attacks, confirm compliance with policy, deter abuse, or other purposes. 

D. Conformance: An affirmative indication or judgment that a product or service has met the requirements of the relevant specifications, contract or regulation; also the state of meeting the requirements. [ANSI-ASQC Standard A3-1987] 

E. Integration: The ability of applications to share information or to process independently by requesting services and satisfying service requests. In a well-integrated system, all of the parts have a purpose, and the parts combine effectively to achieve the purpose of the overall system. 

F. Enterprise: In the computer industry, an enterprise is an organization that uses computers. A word was needed that would encompass corporations, small businesses, non-profit institutions, government bodies, and possibly other kinds of organizations. In practice, the term is applied much more often to larger organizations than smaller ones.  A large-scale, organization wide computer network that may include web-based, client-server, and mainframe computing technologies. An enterprise is an organization that uses computers, but usually implies a larger organization. 'Enterprise Testing and Performance' involves testing the entire Web infrastructure of an organization to ensure optimal performance of Web-based applications.

<DESC>s service line at the collection system. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, lift stations, manholes, septic tanks and a wastewater treatment plant. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the bidder's library, other pertinent information and the following description. Under no circumstances shall the successful Contractor be entitled to any rate adjustment based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.  The U.S. Army Fort Knox wastewater collection system consists of sewer mains and service connections for disposal. The sewer mains direct sewage from both the base and the City of Muldraugh, Kentucky to a wastewater treatment plant located on the base. The collection system on the base consists of 521,400 feet of sewer mains ranging in size from 2" to 36", with 8" being the most common size. There are also 1,745 manholes within the base collection system.  The collection system is broken up into four individual classifications that are identified with the letters C, H, M and W followed by two numbers (e.g. C10). Letter C is an abbreviation for Capart Housing, letter H is an abbreviation for other Housing, M is an abbreviation for Military and W is an abbreviation for Wherry Housing. The two numbers followed by two zeros represent block numbers (e.g. 1000 Block).  The age of the wastewater collection system ranges from 70 years old to 1-year-old and can be divided into three major age groups (<1940, 1950-1989, 1990-2000) with the majority of the collection system being constructed and 17' SWD with three 150 hp Blowers and Coarse Bubble Air Diffusion; Two Belt Presses, 2 m width each; Non-potable water system capable of supplying between 580 gpm and 1160 gpm.  This wastewater treatment plant handles flows from both the Base and the City of Muldraugh. Between April 1999 and March 2000, the wastewater treatment plant received an average influent flow of 3.3 MGD and a maximum daily influent flow of 13.8 MGD. In addition, plant personnel indicated that during wet weather, the influent flow into the treatment plant could be as high as 20 MGD.  Two septic tank systems are used on the Base. One is located north of the City of Muldraugh in the Armor Board Area and the other is located in the Ammo Storage Area.  The U.S. Army Fort Knox currently has a pretreatment program for their wastewater treatment plant.  Activities associated with the pretreatment program include, but are not limited to, facility monitoring and source identification of prohibited pollutants.  Facility monitoring includes facility semi-annual formal and informal inspections, wastewater sampling/analysis and wastewater flow measurement.  Sampling/analysis includes quarterly scheduled sampling/analysis events for each facility and unscheduled random sampling/analysis events as required.  A total of 25 on-base facilities and the City of Muldraugh are being monitored as part of the pretreatment program.  Fort Knox has a total area of about 170 square miles of service area.  There is one off-installation site one mile north of the U.S. Army base, which is the City of Muldraugh with a population of 1,376. The requirement for sewage services is part of and associated with this scope.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 08.

Air Force Research Laboratory Rome Research Site (AFRL RRS) is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase AFRL's knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) of warfighting techniques, equipment and capabilities. Solutions to transitional research and engineering using innovative approaches will be sought.  The scope of this effort primarily focuses on supporting the mission [Produce Integrated, Predictive Air and Space Intelligence to Enable Military Operations, Force Modernization and Policymaking] of the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NAIC) located at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  White papers in the area of Modeling and Simulation science, as applied to: Air and Space Systems [e.g. Terrestrial/Space Communications Network Modeling Tools, etc.], Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Space-Based Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (SBISR) sensors are requested.  This BAA covers a broad range of requirements/topics which specifically include, but are not limited to: improved real-time decision-making (advanced information visualization/animation and data integration tools); spectral library (adaptive signature generation) development for paint degradation and seasonal vegetation change spectral libraries, etc.); predictive assessments [Unorthodox High Speed Propulsion Performance Analysis Tools (e.g. Pulsed Detonation Model, Air Turbo Rocket Model, Turbo-Ramjet Model and SCRAM Jet Model, etc.)]; Hard and Deeply Buried Target (HDBT/WMD-WME) Detection [using MASINT, Hyperspectral (HSI), SAR, SLAR, thermal, spectral, terrain map comparison analysis technologies (e.g. LANDSAT data), airborne / space technologies development, etc.] for detection/visualization of Underground Facilities (UGF)/HDBTs.  Also areas covering:  Radio Frequency (RF) Weapons and Laser Weapons Modeling, Advanced Analysis Capabilities for Integrated Avionics Systems/Suites, Missile System Threat Analysis Tools (Booster and Post Boost Upgrades); and Information In Warfare (IIW) are also required.  Ideas on theoretical foundations of decision science/environments: modeling of cognitive processes; Centers Of Gravity (COG) analysis; Courses Of Action (COA) analysis; Effects Based Operations (EBO); Situation Assessment (SA); Predictive Battlespace Awareness (PBA); Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (IPB); Battlespace Production (BP) Technique/Objective(s) Models; Common Operational Picture (COP); Information Operations (IO) / Information Warfare (IW); etc. are also requested.  AFRL RRS requires solutions sufficient to meet the needs of the Air Force in particular the:  National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NAIC), Air Force Information Warfare Center (AFIWC), Air Intelligence Agency (AIA), Air Combat Command (ACC), Joint Warfare Analysis Center (JWAC), and Air Force Battle Labs, etc.  Some general areas of interest are: modeling cognitive processes, real-time decision making, M&S in distributed mission training, information visualization/animation, M&S for war-gaming/"pre-planning"/exercise rehearsal support, and specific Air and Space Systems Intelligence Mission Applications (IMA). Emphasis is placed on immediate technology transfer/technology insertion of mature technologies (capable of being directly transitioned with minimal R&D enhancement rework) into Air Force operational environments which directly support the war fighter.


THIS ANNOUCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a one-sided, 12 point type, single spaced, one inch margined white paper not to exceed five (5) pages with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, women-owned small, or small disadvantaged business or historically black college, university or minority institution. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to AFRL/IFEB, ATTN: Donald J. Gondek (Reference BAA 03-12-IFKA) 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505. The white paper will be formatted as follows: SECTION A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task and Name of Company; SECTION B: Task Objective and SECTION C: Technical Summary. White papers must reference BAA 03-12-IFKA.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). White papers addressing different areas of applicability must be submitted under separate cover. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Complete proposal instructions will be contained in a letter accepting your white paper and requesting a proposal. Such invitation does not assure the offeror will receive an award. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Evaluation of white papers and solicited proposals will be performed using the following criteria: (1) Effectiveness in Enhancing Modeling and Simulation for Supporting the Air Force Mission (Soundness of Approach); (2) Relevance to the Air Force Mission; (3) Uniqueness of the Approach, and (4) Cost Realism and Reasonableness. Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4. Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the SECRET level; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information. In addition, the offeror must have or have access to a certified and Government-approved facility available to support work under this BAA. Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months in duration; total dollar amounts for all awards is approximately $4.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 03 - $2K; FY 04 - $675k; FY 05 - $1.323M; FY 06 - $1.11M; FY 07 - $910k and FY 08 - $880k.  Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. The cost of preparing proposals in responding to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18. An informational briefing is not planned.  Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available applications.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

Currently, United States Air Force deploys various types of mobile communications shelters around the world to support steady state and contingency operations. These shelters and the associated communications equipment inside of them are subjected to extreme heat when deployed to desert and tropical climates. Environmental Control Units (ECUs) are employed to counteract the effects of the heat, but at times fail due to the high surface temperatures of the shelters. The AWB is interested in existing Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products, technologies, or solutions that could be used as-is or slightly modified to solve this problem of high surface temperatures. 

	These attributes are desired requirements by the USAF:

1.	Reduce solar effects on shelter
2.	Conform to existing shelter footprint of varying sizes. Accommodate S-250 shelter (7 ft 3in L x 6ft 7in W x 5ft 10in H) up to and including 20 ft ISO shelter (19ft 11in L x 8ft W x 8ft H) 
3.	Customizable on site by military technicians to conform to varying antenna placements on shelters
4.	No major internal or external modification to the shelter

	These attributes are considered beneficial but not necessary by the USAF:

1.	Subdued color pattern of either desert tan or camo green.

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:

1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price for the commercial product.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and beneficial attributes of the USAF.
4.	Your interest to demonstrate your product.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 6 Nov 04 to MSgt Brian Marinelli, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  MSgt Brian Marinelli can be reached at (208) 828-3539; brian.marinelli@mountainhome.af.mil.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION 
OF SUMMARY PAPER FOR 
ICAO REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL 
 
Overview: 
 
Interested parties must present their technologies in the context of ICAO Document 9303, which prescribes international format and on-board data standards for machine-readable passports, visas, and other official machine-readable travel documents. 
 
The requested summary paper must be submitted with all responses to the Request for Information (RFI).  A separate summary paper should be submitted with each technology concept introduced.  Summary papers will be included in a comprehensive Summary Report and will be presented to the ICAO Member States.  The Summary Report may be categorized by the following categories. 
 
• Biometrics 
• Data storage media 
• E-Commerce 
• RF technologies 
• Self-service facilitation 
• Travel document printers 
• Travel document readers 
• Travel document security concepts 
 

Purpose: 
 
The summary paper is not a marketing tool.  It is an information tool that will be used by the ICAO New Technologies Working Group (NTWG) in their quest for considering standards for new technologies with possible application to machine-readable travel documents, and to familiarize ICAO Member States with the new technologies in a summary form. 
 
The information on the summary paper should be accurate, succinct, complete and descriptive of the technology being introduced.  The summary paper reflects how interested parties would like their technology presented in summary form to the NTWG and the ICAO Member States.  It should highlight all information, which interested parties would like to convey to ICAO. 
 
Categories and Requirements: 
 
Biometrics 
 
Requirement:  Facial, finger and iris biometric technologies and new concepts that may be used in the travel document issuance process or to link travel documents to their rightful owners. 
 
ICAO Member States have a variety of methodologies and requirements for the submission of travel document applications.  This ranges from personal appearance at an acceptance facility or issuing authority to mail in applications with the expectation of Internet based applications being accepted in the short to medium term.  Additionally, Member States have a wide range of travel document record database sizes and storage media.  Issuing authorities may check each new applicant biometric with all existing applicant biometrics (one to many) and or check each renewal against the existing biometric held for that applicant (one to one).  For successful implementation in an issuance environment, the biometric technologies and systems will need to demonstrate the following key attributes: 
 
• Biometric enrolment and subsequent renewal in person (live capture) 
• Biometric enrolment and subsequent renewal via a variety of media (mail and Internet) 
• Ability to accurately and rapidly undertake 1 to 1 and 1 to many verifications and searches in biometric databases containing up to 100 million records. 
• Ability to match biometric records for individuals over time. 
• Ability to use image data currently stored in legacy systems. 
 

ICAO Member states may use biometric systems in a self-service environment at their ports of entry.  For successful implementation in a border control environment, the biometric technologies and systems will need to demonstrate the following key attributes: 
 
• Ability to rapidly and accurately collect stored biometric data from a travel document and verify it with that of the holder. 
• Ability to rapidly and accurately capture a biometric from the data-page of a travel document and encode it to enable immediate and automated verification with the holder. 
• Ability to rapidly and accurately undertake a 1 to 1 and 1 to few verifications and searches in biometric databases. 
• Ability to match biometric records for individuals over time. 
 

Data Storage Media 
 
Requirement:  Data storage media that can be utilized in conjunction with biometric and machine verification technologies and concepts. 
 
Border Authorities have a strong desire for contactless mode of operation and high capacity data storage.    A common electronic storage medium is necessary to enable States to conduct border deployment in a cohesive manner.  Non-proprietary technology is required.  Flexibility is required.  ICAO/NTWG continues with its strong support and efforts to make the storage medium for globally interoperable biometrics a contactless IC chip that is a minimum size of 32 Kilobytes and in ISO 14443 Type A or B compliance.  Additionally, information is sought on other storage media in order to assess their relative benefits. 
 
E-Commerce 
 
Requirement:  Turnkey electronic on-line systems that may be applied to secure Internet based passport and visa application processes. 
 
Vendors are invited to propose applications or solutions they have developed which would readily support the implementation of Internet based E-Commerce or E-government style travel document issuance channels.  Issues relating to privacy and the ability to satisfy stringent identity authentication requirements are critical to the successful implementation of on line travel document application and issuance systems.  Such solutions would be expected to include the following functionality: 
 
• Secure online customer or citizen application for a variety of travel documents. 
• Secure receipt of required bio data, most typically but not exclusively photo and signature. 
• Secure business-to-business style ability to merge data from a variety of sources to assist in validating applications including payment functionality. 
• Ability to support customer-centric reporting on processing status without agency intervention. 
• Ability of solution proposed to enable electronic sharing of validated data to facilitate travel movements. 
 

RF Technologies 
 
Requirements:  The application of radio frequency technologies in travel documents. 
 
ICAO/NTWG is seeking radio frequency identification technologies that enable broad-based application growth.  ICAO/NTWG is seeking RFID equipment that can be used interchangeably with equipment from different manufactures.  The amount of data storage to be communicated should not be less than 32K.  The data should be protected against unauthorized access by appropriate encryption, microprocessor, or other means.  Any item of data stored should be accessible within 10 seconds.  The transponder may interface with the document either by physical contact or separated from the document by a distance of 10 centimeters.  In addition, ICAO/NTWG seeks information on other specific approaches to RF solutions. 
 
 
 
Self-Service Facilitation 
 
Requirements:  Technologies and processes that are suitable for automated self-identification at international borders and/or entitlement facilities that will enable either unattended border crossing or program enrolment (Kiosk).  
 
Systems and technologies that enable border control agencies to reduce personnel costs for lower risk high volume transactions through the use of automation in accomplishing secure unassisted clearance processing at international ports of entry/or departure.  These systems may be used for unassisted enrolment in travel document application or issuance processes.  Key attributes of these systems are: 
 
• Simplicity of uses for applicants and travelers. 
• Rapid transaction processing. 
• Secure systems that facilitate the link between the document and holder or application and applicant. 
• Secure systems that facilitate the link between the holder or applicant to existing database records. 
 

Submissions should detail connectivity with existing infrastructure, explain methods by which enrolment can be accomplished with or without assistance and explore costs and impact of system deployment in various live environments.  Where available, performance data from previous or existing system test should be included for the purpose of detailed evaluation. 
 
Travel document printers 
 
Requirements:  Secure printers that are suitable for operation in both a low and high transaction volume environment with limited technical support.  Cost is a critical factor. 
 
Secure machine-readable travel documents personalization systems suitable for operation at high volume locations and at remote issuance sites where transactions may be as low as 100 per annum and where technology support may be very limited.  The systems should: 
 
• Apply high quality digital images and text to the travel document. 
• Be user friendly and require minimal low-cost maintenance. 
• Be able to print to the end page and inside data pages of the travel document. 
• Incorporate effective security features (overt, device–assist and forensic). 
 

It is highly desirable that the printers: 
 
• Have integrated systems that will allow for the seamless writing of data to travel document data storage devices (i.e. contact-less IC’s) during personalization processes. 
 

Submissions should include details of the test procedures and results used to prove the performance of the system.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Solicitation for Information and Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is the first mission under the Living With a Star program as part of the Sun-Earth Connection.  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun, thus enhancing NASA’s understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow-on to the successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission.  It will be a three-axis stabilized satellite in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and having an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will have a mission life of 5 years, and currently, is scheduled for launch in April 2008. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is soliciting comments on requirements established regarding the SDO Communications Subsystem Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA).  The present requirements are specified in the attached documents: Exhibit 1 – Statement of Work for SDO Project Ka-band Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (464-COMM-LEGL-0059), Exhibit 2 – Performance Specification SDO Ka-band Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (464-COMM-SPEC-0100), and Exhibit 3 Deliverable Items List and Schedule (DILS) SDO Project – Ka-band Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier. This notice is issued by the NASA GSFC to post a draft SOW, Specification, and DILS via the Internet, and to solicit input and recommendations from interested parties.  The objective of this RFI is to gather information that promotes competition and increases procurement efficiency by improving NASA GSFC’s knowledge of industry’s capabilities.  NASA GSFC invites potential offerors to submit information that may be used to determine eligibility to be participants in feedback sessions with the SDO project.  This procedure is described in FAR Part 15.202.  The intent of the sessions is to provide dialogue in which participants can provide feedback on NASA GSFC requirements and its acquisition approach.  The compilation of submitted information may be factored along with SDO requirements to refine the aforementioned SOW (Exhibit 1), Specification (Exhibit 2), and DILS (Exhibit 3). Potential offerors are requested to submit information in the form of a brief Capabilities and Qualifications Statement that includes: 1) Capability to comply with the present requirements outlined in the Performance Specification and SOW.  Requirements that are not in compliance should be noted with brief comment that either describe how a potential offeror’s Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier could be brought into compliance or state the potential offeror’s position on such requirement.  This would serve as a main topic in one-on-one feedback sessions.	It should also be stated as to whether certain requirements are cost drivers or increase risk and as to whether or not a fixed-price contract would be acceptable.  2) Capability to meet the hardware deliverable schedule, and 3) Summary of past relevant experience in developing traveling wave tube amplifiers.  Please advise if this requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in Internet “Note A”. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. This notice constitutes all information concerning the SDO Communications Subsystem Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier that will be furnished at this time.  Interested firms are requested to submit their capability statements to Ms. Lorrie Eakin, by email at Lorrie.L.Eakin@nasa.gov no later than the response date indicated above.  Documents, comments, and questions may be forwarded to Ms. Eakin via electronic transmission or by facsimile transmission.  In addition, copies of all documents shall also be forwarded to Mr. Michael K. Powers, at NASA GSFC, Mail Code 597, Greenbelt, MD  20771, or by e-mail at Michael.K.Powers@nasa.gov.  When responding reference the number above (e.g., SDO-XXXX-XXX-XXXX). This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, or will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.  Respondents will not be notified of the final results from the one-on-one discussions.  An ombudsman has been appointed—See NASA Specific Note “B”.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 2000 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA GSFC Business Opportunities home page is  http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=51  .  It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<SUBJECT>Sale of Surplus Highly Enriched Uranium
<DESC>The Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is soliciting expressions of interest in the purchase and down-blending of surplus U.S. highly enriched uranium (HEU).  NNSA is developing a list of companies that may be interested in the purchase of the surplus HEU.  Interested parties may be commercial nuclear power companies, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensed facilities with blend down capabilities, nuclear fuel cycle suppliers, or teams consisting of several interested firms. The HEU being offered is believed to be high-purity material. When down-blended with commercial natural uranium, the bulk of this material should produce LEU that meets applicable ASTM specifications for commercial nuclear power reactor fuel.  A portion of this material may require cross-blending or chemical purification to meet the applicable specifications.  The chemical purification would primarily be required to remove the uranium from its current alloyed or compounded form.  Any required cross-blending or chemical purification are the responsibility of the winning bidder or team. The winning bidder or team will be required to accept delivery of the HEU at a secure facility in the United States, licensed for possession and processing of HEU. The winning bidder will be responsible for ensuring the HEU is blended down to an enrichment level below 10 wt% 235U within two years of receipt. The quantity of HEU available will be no less than 15 tonnes and up to 17.4 tonnes.  The majority of the HEU, 10 to 12.4 tonnes, is in the form of metal. The metal is in the form of broken pieces and slugs, with no dimension exceeding 2.25 inches.  The HEU metal has an average enrichment of approximately 75 wt% 235U.  A small portion of this material may require cross-blending or chemical purification to meet the applicable specifications. The remainder of the material is in the form of alloyed and unalloyed HEU metal, unirradiated HEU reactor fuel elements, and HEU compounds.  This material would have an average enrichment in the range of 60-75 wt% 235U. The majority of this material may require cross-blending or chemical purification to meet the applicable specifications. The winning bidder will be expected to include in its proposal the capability to down-blend the HEU subject to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verification regime on the down-blending process (but not on material while in storage).  Interested parties must be able to begin receiving the material by December 31, 2005.  NNSA expects to deliver the material at a roughly steady rate during calendar years 2006-09. This is not a request for proposals (RFP).  NNSA anticipates issuing a RFP in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 with award in the fourth quarter of FY 2005. A second announcement will be made prior to release of the RFP to finalize the bidders list. Interested parties should respond to this announcement by providing the following information:  Company name, address, a point of contact, contact information (phone number and e-mail) and a statement of capabilities. Companies are encouraged to identify any concerns or issues that could impact their decision to bid on this material and/or suggestions on the structure of the business arrangement that may improve the economics of the sale.   Any concerns or suggestions will be kept confidential, but will be considered in the development of terms and conditions of the RFP.  NNSA may contact responding companies for additional information. Responses to this announcement are requested within two weeks of publication of this expression of interest.  Responses should be sent to Carol Elliott, NNSA Y-12 National Security Complex, P.O. Box 2050, Mail Stop 8009, Oak Ridge, TN, 37831.

<SUBJECT>99--High Performance Vibration Test System
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Unholtz-Dickie Corporation, Wallingford, CT.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Redstone Technical Test Center.  The Redstone Technical Test Center Dynamic Test Branch has the requirement to accomplish shock and vibration testing for aviation and missile systems such as UH-60M, UH-60Q, UH-60L, A2C2S, CH-47 Reset, ATIRCM/CMWS, Star SAFIRE FLIR II, TOW, HELLFIRE, MLRS, Army TACMS, JAVELIN, and THAAD.  This mission involves the use of high performance shock and vibration excitation systems.  This procurement action will provide total replacement of an existing and antiquated vibration system. The excitation system requested will be powered by an Unholtz-Dickie SAI120 Class D solid state power amplifier.  The amplifier will be configured to allow velocity levels up to 143 ips, which is more than double the existing performance of 70 ips.  Also, the excitation system has a true, built in, two-inch double amplitude stroke capability.  The capability of achieving the required high velocity and large displacement are unique to the UD-T2000 inductive armature technology and will greatly benefit Army test programs, which require ever increasing performance of test equipment.  Due to reductions in the number of maintenance personnel in recent years, it has become necessary to greatly improve maintenance efficiency.  However, it is the nature of high power amplifiers to have a relatively short mean time between failures.  The modular design of solid state power amplifiers such as the Unholtz-Dickie SAI series have made it possible to swap out a bad power module to maintain functionality of the system while repairs to the damaged hardware may be made off line.  Using a combination of compatible amplifiers and as few as two maintenance technicians skilled in the operation of a given amplifier, maintenance of the power amplifiers can be made very efficient with a minimum of on-shelf spare parts.  Therefore, the required power amplifier modules must be 100 percent compatible with existing Unholtz-Dickie Class D 30/60 KVA amplifier modules. To compete this action and award to another vendor would result in loss of compatibility between the new system and existing amplifiers.  It would also represent the loss of existing detailed knowledge of exciter/amplifier maintenance actions, resulting in a subsequent reduction in maintenance efficiency. Award to a vendor other than Unholtz-Dickie Corporation would therefore result in substantial duplication of cost that the Government is not expected to recover through an open competition. Therefore, due to time, compatibility, and related cost issues, no other vendor other than Unholtz-Dickie Corporation meets the requirements.  RTTC has determined that the equipment required is available from only one responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy agency requirements. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST October 18, 2004 will be considered by the Government.  POC:  Mathew Ridolfi, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170.  Questions must be emailed  to Mathew Ridolfi at  Mathew.ridolfi@mms.gov.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<DESC>Expeditionary Warfare and Coastal Operations (BAA 05-01) (1 Oct 2004) The Naval Sea Systems Command, Panama City (NAVSEA Panama City) conducts research and development of techniques and technologies directed toward operations in a littoral environment in support of expeditionary warfare and coastal operations. NAVSEA Panama City’s mission includes mine warfare (both mine countermeasures (MCM) and mining), amphibious warfare, diving and life support, special warfare, and other missions conducted in the coastal region. Within these mission areas, NAVSEA Panama City is responsible for the full spectrum of research, development and acquisition, and support functions. Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; and development of operational concepts and tactics. NAVSEA Panama City is interested in receiving proposals for research and development in all of its mission areas. This notice constitutes a Br! oad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)2. It is intended that this BAA be open from 1 Oct 2004 to 30 Sep 2005. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: (1) environmental data collection, monitoring, analysis, or display; (2) multifunction underwater sensing designs and technology; (3) image and sensor data processing; (4) modeling and simulation; (5) innovative conventional and non-conventional systems for MCM, amphibious warfare, naval mining, diving and life support, homeland security, force protection or special warfare tactics, techniques, procedures applicable to all phases of the battle timeline including surveillance, targeting, acquisition, and all terminal phases including amphibious logistics and the moving of cargo from afloat to ashore, consistent with ship-to-objective-maneuver and sea basing concepts; (6) shipboard system modular integration concepts; (7) innovative and non conventional concepts for application of techno! logy, engineering and systems to  of coastal operations and coastal warfare including waterproofing, shock mitigation and isolation, and human systems interfaces; (8) lasers, radar, millimeter wave, or other high energy sensors or weapons; (9) command, control, communication, localization, navigation, guidance and data transmission  in the air, sea, or thru the ground; (10) concepts and systems for remote control of sea mines; (11) autonomous and remotely controlled vehicles: air, surface, sea surface, undersea or ground; (12) Techniques or methods to increase the autonomy of current unmanned vehicles (air, surface, sea surface, or ground); (13) information processing, fusion, and display;  (14) data fusion/correlation for applications involving methodologies to translate/correlate data between different acoustic sensors/frequencies so that data/images taken with one sensor can be translated into equivalent data/images with another system; (15) Chemical / Biological individual protection; (16) Kinetic and mechanistic studies of atmospheric transformations in enclosed environments;  Proposals may be submitted by any commercial firm, Institution of higher education (other than federal government) with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such entities. NAVSEA Panama City encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities. The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be: (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) on average, be funded between $10,000 to $1,000,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic (although NAVSEA Panama City reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic; (4) NAVSEA Panama City is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before); (5) NAVSEA Panama City is seeking proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution. Proposals for evolutionary engineering of ! improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and are not allowed. In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as an initial step, interested parties should submit concept or  white  papers briefly summarizing the technical direction, relevance and scope of the proposed effort, and a brief synopsis of qualifications based on accomplishments, and provide a rough order of magnitude cost. White papers should be no more than 5-7 pages in length. White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to NAVSEA Panama City’s specific mission areas; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NAVSEA Panama City programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed ef! fort are to be delivered to NAVSEA Panama City with unrestricted (Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offerors capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; (6) Realism of the proposed cost and the availability of funds. Based on evaluation of the White papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by NAVSEA Panama City using the above noted evaluation criteria. An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. For efforts funded as legally binding commitments, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will includ! e the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities. This is to notify potential proposers that each grant or cooperative agreement that may be placed under this announcement or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause:  As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students. If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public!  Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.  If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation.

<SUBJECT>--Industry Day Announcement - The U S Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating the Turbine/Generator upgrade of Hydropower Units at Whitney Hydropower Plant near Laguna Park, Texas
<DESC>Industry Day Announcement:  No proposals are being requested with this synopsis.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating the Turbine/Generator upgrade of Hydropower Units at Whitney Hydropower Plant, Near Laguna Park, Texas.  North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this project is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.  Small Business Size Standard for this project is $28.5 Million.  Federal Supply Code is Z211, Maintenance, Repair or Altera tion, Dams.  Purpose:  The purpose of industry day is to partner with industry to allow for a pre-final specification review and a plant tour for the purpose of reviewing the contract specifications and providing feedback in order to obtain competitive, biddable contra ct specifications and proposals once advertised.  This forum will allow contractors an opportunity to review contract plans and specifications and ask for clarification.  A requirement exists to upgrade the generating capacity to 23.3 MVA.   Contract specifications to install an upgrade to meet our requirement will be distributed to all in attendance during this event. The Whitney Hydropower Units have been approved for major rehabilitation.  The Turbine/Generator upgrade will include new turbine runners, rewound generators and new governor. Schedule:  The day of the event is scheduled 28 October, 2004 from 7:30  4pm at the Whitney Hydropower Plant in Texas near Laguna Park just off HWY 22 approximately 20 miles west of I35 at Hillsboro (powerhouse entrance road on west end of dam). Background/history:  The Whitney powerhouse has been operating as a peaking plant for nearly 50 years.  The peaking operation results in an average of 200 start-stops per unit per year.  On both units, the cumulative effects of age and start-stops are show ing up as a pattern of generator failures thus indicating a declining reliability.  Both of the generators have been de-rated from a design overload capability of 17.2 MW down to a maximum of 15 MW due to cumulative problems.   Whitney powerhouse is a link in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).  The demand for ERCOT power has grown on average of 3.2 percent annually from 1990 to 1999.  The peak summer demand for power increased by 3.9 percent from 1999 to 2000.  ER COT has estimated an increase 2.35 percent annually through 2009.  Therefore the risk of continued brownout or blackout from insufficient total capacity and voltage stability is increased because of less reliable equipment. Who is authorized:  All interested contractors and subcontractors.  Please limit attendance to two persons per company.  Notification of intent to attend is required by 19 October 2004.  Provide the Company Name, Name of attendees and titles by U.S. Mail, fax or email to:  Arthur G. Tuttlebee, Contract Specialist, USAED-Ft. Worth District, CESWF-CT-C, P.O.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
”Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
”Inverted Domestic Corporation”. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-- 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held--
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
”Person,” “domestic,” and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.
