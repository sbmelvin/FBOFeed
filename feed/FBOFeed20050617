<CONTACT>Kimberly Luke Contract Specialist 7037871339     kimberly.luke@mms.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Oil Spill Response Research (OSRR).   The MMS web site has descriptions of OSRR activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects.   The web site address is www.mms.gov/tarphome.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.     BACKGROUND: Oil Spill Response Research sponsored by the MMS through the TA&R Program is directly integrated into MMS's offshore operations and is used in making regulatory decisions pertaining to permit and plan approvals, safety and pollution inspections, enforcement actions, and training requirements.  MMS proposes to expand its existing OSRR program consistent with our statutory responsibility and the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  As oil and gas industry activities increase in the deep water of Gulf of Mexico and the and ice-infested Beaufort Sea of Alaska, research must be broadened to address unknown factors concerning mechanical equipment performance and reliability as well as alternative countermeasures, including chemical dispersants, in situ burning and viscous oil pumping.  The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested.  Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2006 funds. The MMS anticipates a total of $500,000 to $800,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSRR topics in FY 2006 with projects being identified through this announcement. Typical projects envisioned to address the topics set forth below may require up to one man-year effort and cost up to $250,000.  Prospective offeror's shall bear this in mind when responding to this request.  NOTICE: The MMS may share the White Paper submissions with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do not want the Papers/proposals shared outside the MMS.  The MMS anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis.  OBJECTIVES: The topics for the FY 2006 OSRR activities include ONLY research related to the following: 1.  Innovative Mechanical Oil Spill Containment and Recovery Technologies for the Open Ocean - new or innovative technologies that will facilitate the cleanup of spilled oil (both light and high density) in the open ocean.  A subject of particular interest is response techniques and equipment for removing heavy oils (crude oil as well as fuel oil) and emulsions from the sea surface.  MMS seeks proposals to performance test and evaluate full-scale prototypes and non-commercially available technologies at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey.  American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations. 2.  Innovative Mechanical Oil Spill Containment and Recovery Technologies for Cold Water/Broken Ice Conditions - new or innovative mechanical technologies that will facilitate the containment and recovery of spilled oil in cold water/broken ice conditions.  MMS seeks proposals to performance test and evaluate full-scale prototype, non-commercially available technologies, and/or adaptations of existing technologies to contain and recover oil in a range of conditions that could include broken ice.  Proposals should focus on the types of broken ice typically found in the near shore areas of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, where oil exploration activities are currently taking place or are planned.  Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey.     ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations. 3.  Alternative Technologies for Oil Spill Response in Open Ocean, Cold Water-Broken Ice Conditions - new or innovative technologies/methods that will facilitate oil spill response in open water and cold water/broken ice conditions.  MMS seeks proposals to test and evaluate alternative technologies and/or adaptations of existing technologies to respond to oil spills in open water and cold water/broken ice conditions.  Proposals addressing cold water/broken ice conditions should focus on the types of broken ice typically found in the near shore areas of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, where oil exploration activities are currently taking place or are planned.  Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey.  ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.      4.  Remote Sensing, Detection and Tracking of Spilled Oil - Increased offshore exploration, development and production are planned for the Deep Water areas of the Gulf of Mexico as well as the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea's.  Methods for the remote sensing, detection and tracking oil in the open ocean as well as in and under ice need to be investigated.  MMS is seeking proposals on new and innovative equipment and technologies for the remote sensing, detection and tracking of oil in open water as well as in and under ice. This equipment shall be able to locate and accurately map the location of the oil.  Maps shall be ARCGIS compatible.  MMS seeks proposals to test and evaluate these technologies in a range of conditions that could include broken and solid ice conditions. Proposals addressing cold water/broken ice conditions should focus should be on the types of broken ice typically found in the near shore areas of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, where oil exploration activities are currently taking place or are planned.  Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey and/or through a series of field tests conducted in the Arctic environment.  ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.      5.  Oil Spill Chemical Dispersant Research - MMS is seeking proposals that will provide research data relating to the use of dispersants on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), including cold water-broken ice conditions.  Dispersant effectiveness testing in the laboratory is not always representative of dispersant effectiveness in the field.  It is difficult to determine the true effectiveness of dispersants that have not been tested on actual spills.  MMS is seeking proposals to define and test the methodologies used to correlate dispersant effectiveness tests in the laboratory to the effectiveness rates in real spills.  Of particular interest are methods to realistically assess dispersant effectiveness in the field as a function of dispersant type, sea state, salinity, oil type and weathering state, dispersant-to-oil ratio, and environmental conditions.      6.  Synthetic-based drilling fluid droplet size study - The deepwater Gulf of Mexico continues to be an expanding frontier with many new discoveries. Synthetic-based drilling fluids (SBF) are the preferred drill fluid for deep waters and are permitted for use throughout the Gulf of Mexico by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  MMS seeks proposals to characterize the size of droplets of SBF that could result from a release and disperse into the water column. The proposal should focus on typical SBF composition and a range of shear conditions to determine droplet size. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to oil spill response, safety and pollution practices related to offshore operations. As a result of the White Papers, selected proposals will be sought and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should be to the above stated issues.  Multi-year funding of projects is acceptable.  HOW TO RESPOND:  White Papers, not more than five (5) pages in length, an original, five (5) hard copies, and one (1) electronic copy in .PDF format on CD shall be submitted to U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE, ATTENTION: Olivia F.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals for approximately 9-12 task order contracts to provide the services for the project entitled, “Accelerating Change and Transforming Organizations and Networks” (ACTION).  The purpose of the ACTION  program is to accelerate the development, implementation, dissemination and uptake of demand-driven and evidence-based products, tools, strategies and findings to improve healthcare delivery systems and health outcomes in the U.S.  “Demand-driven” refers to AHRQ’s intent for the work of ACTION to be heavily influenced by those who manage, deliver or receive health care services. Through ACTION, AHRQ will also support the development of new strategies and tools to achieve the programs’ goals. Information about the AHRQ’s precursor of this program, the Integrated Delivery System Research Network, can be found at www.ahrq.gov/research/idsrn.htm. 

To achieve the program goals, ACTION awardees will engage in rapid cycle tasks and activities that vary according to the scope of work of each individual task order under a task order contract. Tasks and activities may include: (1) Assessing needs for demand-driven and evidence-based findings, tools, products and strategies, particularly those identified by delivery system operational leaders and champions (clinical and managerial) who are making critical decisions and managing change; (2) Conducting timely applied research in these key areas; (3)Evaluating which interventions and strategies demonstrate improvement in the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of US health care delivery;(4) Most importantly, promoting the dissemination and uptake of demand-driven and evidence-based products, tools, strategies and findings that result from these projects to improve delivery systems and health outcomes. Activities may also include assisting AHRQ in exploring new strategies and tools to achieve the programs’ goals. The essence of this task will be to broaden adoption and successful implementation of clinical, organizational, and managerial practices, regardless of who originally produced the evidence.  

AHRQ is particularly interested in receiving proposals from partnerships that include one or more organizations with a demonstrated capacity to “turn research to practice” for proven interventions targeting those who manage, deliver or receive health care services. This may be achieved in various ways (e.g., through collaboration and communication tools established for members of the organization and its target audiences). If the lead organization does not have this capacity itself, it is expected to acquire this capacity through collaboration or affiliation with one or more organizations with a proven track record of promoting healthcare improvement and the uptake of findings and innovations within or among healthcare delivery systems. The existence of collaborative relationships, or willingness to consult, with experts in areas such as payment and incentives is also of value.

Offerors’ partnerships may include healthcare delivery systems that:   (1) Provide direct care to patients in settings including but not limited to: inpatient, outpatient or ambulatory care centers, community health centers, emergency medical services, laboratories, diagnostic centers, pharmacies, nursing homes, home health agencies, assisted living facilities, and adult day care; (2) Consist of, include, or are affiliated with, safety-net providers or providers caring for priority populations (low-income groups; minority groups; women; children; elderly; and individuals with special care needs, including individuals with disabilities and individuals with chronic care or end-of-life health care needs);  (3) Address healthcare concerns falling within or across AHRQ’s interests in: care management; cost, organization/design of delivery systems and socio-economics (including use of financial and non-financial incentives); data development; health information technology; long-term care; pharmaceutical outcomes; health protection, health promotion, and health marketing; quality improvement and patient safety; system capacity and emergency preparedness; and training. Not all topic areas will be funded in each year; offerors must be aware that shifts in funding opportunities throughout the contract period of performance will have an impact on topic foci from year to year.      

In addition, offerors’ partnerships may include: Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), Veterans Administration (VA) sites and other governmental organizations; Health plans of any model type or business line; Universities, academic health centers, research consulting firms, or other research organizations working to improve care in delivery systems and with expertise in the areas mentioned above;  Employers or employer coalitions; Other organizations that work closely with providers as members or partners at the national, state or regional level to promote or leverage evidence-based improvements in health care and health care organization. 

It is not possible to specify the scope of work or performance criteria for each request for task order (RFTO) to be issued under the 9-12 task order contracts. In general, proposals submitted in response to an RFTO may include: A clear understanding of the issue addressed, well-reasoned goals consistent with the RFTO, acknowledgement of potential problem areas, the planned approach and justification compared with competing approaches; Relevant direct experience working with the proposed participating delivery system(s), experts, leaders or champions to successfully conduct the task order within its proposed timeframe; qualifications of key personnel; how responsibilities will be divided, decisions made, work monitored, and quality assured; Plans to successfully access and manipulate the necessary data and the quality, integration, size and diversity of proposed databases and information systems; Management plan and evidence of structures and processes in place to successfully collaborate among needed partner organizations and individuals within in the proposed timeframe; A budget estimate commensurate with the scope of work and level of needed commitment by key personnel, and the nature and extent of any resource contribution by the offeror; Anticipated findings/outcomes and contributions to the field of this work; A plan for the evaluation of findings, tools, products or strategies, including generalizability and resource implications; A plan for dissemination activities and how to document and assess the degree of uptake of the findings, tools, products or strategies; A schedule of milestones and deliverables.

It is anticipated that 9-12 task order contracts will be awarded for a period of 3 years with one two-year option.  Awards are expected by December 30, 2005.  In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will also be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ’s website at www.ahrq.gov. It is the offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation and monitor the site for any subsequent amendments. Since it is not know who is downloading the solicitation, a bidders list will not be available.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be evaluated by AHRQ. It is estimated that the solicitation will be issue don or about July 6, 2005, with proposals due 75 days thereafter.

However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.

The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in descending order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.  The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal Agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.

Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.

RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services b! eing purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!  for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revi! sed performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment! , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. The following provisions with a "FILL-IN" must be filled out completely and submitted with the offer: 52.219-1[FILL-IN]; 52.222-22 [FILL-IN]; 52.222-25[FILL-IN].

Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.

RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis for epidemiologic services regarding Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) with The Northern California Cancer Center, 2201 Walnut Ave., Suite300, Fremont, CA 94538.  The procurement will be processed in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.   Over the last 20 years, the Genetic Epidemiology Branch has accrued data on over 40 families having two or more cases of HL, and is currently conducting studies to map susceptibility genes.  NCI GEB has conducted a genome-wide scan in these families and has identified several regions of the genome with suggestive evidence for HL susceptibility genes.  For these studies to continue to be successful and maximally informative, it will be necessary to expand the family resources available in order to improve the power to detect genes definitively, replicate any genetic linkage and association findings from high-density HL families in a population-based sample, compute population cancer risks associated with identified genes, and determine whether environmental factors associated with HL in the population also play a role in families. Under a previous contract, a feasibility study was conducted by Northern California Cancer Center (NCCC) in 2004.  NCCC contacted all 14 NCI SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) cancer registries to determine their interest in participating in the effort to identify HL familial cases. In addition, NCCC under another previous contract is currently developing study documents, questionnaires, detailed epidemiological and family medical history, consent forms etc.  Specifications for a tracking database and computer assisted telephone interview system are also currently being developed.  Services completed under the previous contracts were necessary in order for this study to continue.  Changing variables at this time will interrupt the correct interpretations of the current study in progress. The NCCC research institution focuses on population-based cancer research and education and has operated the population-based cancer registry for the Greater Bay Area (Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry) as part of the SEER program since the 1980’s. The principal investigators at the NCCC have played and continue to play a leadership role for the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry and also have been and remain a part of the SEER and CCR (California Cancer Registry) leadership community.  The Northern California Cancer Center has extensive experience in three areas required to the proposed study: 1) membership in SEER and other cancer registry programs, 2) HL epidemiology including familial aggregation and, 3) first-hand development and operation of a successful cancer registry-based resource of population-based cancer patients and their affected families.  The Northern California Cancer Center is the only source known to the NCI that has an active research program in HL.  In addition, NCCC has conducted several analytic epidemiologic studies of HL etiology and survival that have involved successfully contacting and interviewing HL patients identified from the registry, and borrowing their pathology specimens for laboratory studies. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on July 1, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.   Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) in order to receive an award.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Lawrence Friedman, LLC, 11712 Farmland Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, for the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) to provide consultation services to the Director of the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), and the Senior Advisor on Clinical and Translational Sciences.  STATEMENT OF WORK:  1) Providing scientific review of documents, policies, and issues as they relate to Roadmap initiatives (e.g. those related to NECTAR) that will impact translational and clinical sciences.  2) Provide advice concerning new initiatives in clinical and translational research that are being developed by a trans-NIH committee under the direction of NCRR and will also review and critique the final documents.  3) Provide updates on meetings held both internal to NIH and externally with the extramural community, sponsored by NCRR to foster the smooth transition and integration and developing programs in NCRR.   This project is expected to require 224 man hours during the period of performance, beginning on July 5, 2005, through January 4, 2006.  The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills, and expertise of the extramural  environments at NIH and the ability to communicate effectively with both areas of science and research; also, the successful management of clinical research programs utilizing innovational approaches to complex, difficult, and often high-profile situations.  For all these reasons, it is most cost effective to award this contract to Dr. Friedman who has the expertise in the scientific area, the understanding of the NIH environment, and the specific knowledge and experience of Roadmap initiatives.  An award to any other source would affect the NIH’s anticipated outcome based upon Dr. Friedman’s experience, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.   The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.0M.  The acquisition is being conducted  under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures. It is noted that FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement is not applicable to simplified acquisition.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties are requested to review the above requirements, and submit a statement of interest which includes:  documented experience in clinical study design and monitoring and in data access issues, particularly related to clinical research data; familiarity  with medical-scientific public communications and interactions with other government agencies; documented intimate knowledge of NIH regulations and policies, including NIH cooperative agreements, contracts and grants policies.  The statement of interest must propose a methodology of assuring the achievement of timely and acceptable performance of the work, as well as the proposed method for administration of costs relevant to this contract,  and at least three (3) references documenting past performance experiences and completion of the project.  The submission will be evaluated on the Offeror’s hourly rate, documented knowledge, skills, abilities, and experiences as reflected in the statement of interest, and past performance.  The statement of interest must be submitted on or before June 24, 12:00 noon.   The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number “NHLBI-PS-2005-112-DDC,” may be submitted to the  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20814-7902,  Attention: Deborah Coulter.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and Subpart 13.106 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Request for quotation number RFQ-DC-05-00235 shall be referenced on any quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect thru Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04.  This procurement  is being solicited on a total small business set-aside basis.  The NAICS and small business size standard for this project are 541620/$6.0 million.  Only one award will result from this solicitation, via the issuance of a time and materials purchase order. STATEMENT OF WORK:  Technical Assistance  and Statistical Analysis of CASTNET Data and DataMart. BACKGROUND EPA's Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) is responsible for providing siting assistance and analyzing Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) data.  CASTNET is an ambient air and deposition monitoring system designed to help  assess the effectiveness of nationwide emission reduction programs.  This requirement supports these siting and analytical activities.  The validity of the deposition and deposition-related parameters is of critical importance to the regulated community and to the implementation of Titles I and IV  of the Clean Air Act (which establish the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the NOx Budget Program and the Acid Rain Program).  This is because errors in deposition measurements may call into question the environmental benefits of these programs.  TASKS AND DELIVERABLES.  Task #1: Develop relative bias  and acceptance criteria. The contractor shall develop a methodology for determining the relative bias and acceptance criteria for newly installed MARGA (multi-pollutant monitors) and single gas (trace level) analyzers against both current CASTNET filter pack (teflon, nylon, and Whatman), denuder  filter pack (reference method), and any other reference methods measurements taken at co-located sites, and accounting for the different measurement time periods of each instrument / methodology.  Once the initial intensive one month study (not part of this requirement) has been completed, the  contractor shall analyze the collected data and update the criteria as needed for use in further comparisons.  The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will provide the contractor with technical assistance documents, standard operating procedures and QA procedures, where possible, for each  parameter.  Deliverable: Develop a methodology for determining the relative bias and acceptance criteria.  Due: 2 weeks after award.  Deliverable: Update methodology for determining the relative bias and acceptance criteria based on data collected.  Due: Four weeks from delivery of intensive one  month study data to the contractor.  Task #2: Determine the effects of seasonality and other significant factors.  The contractor shall determine the effects of seasonality, missing data, and any other significant factor detected by statistical tests or by other means on each currently measured and  new parameter identified in Tables 1 and 2 below and for each averaging period (day, week, month, and annual).  All of the data listed in Tables 1 and 2 resides on EPA's OAK server.  Tables 1 and 2 list the currently measured and new parameters, respectively. TABLE 1:  Parameters currently measured  by CASTNET:  Filter Pack (Teflon, nylon, and Whatman) Measured Parameters: Ca, Cl, HNO3, K, Mg, Na, NH4, NO3, SO2, SO4.  Other Measured Parameters: O3, Precipitation, Relative Humidity, Sigma Theta - standard deviation of horizontal wind direction, Solar Radiation, Temperature, Wetness, Wind  Direction, Wind Speed.  TABLE 2: New Hourly measurement parameters: From MARGA:  SO4, NO3, PO4, C2O4, NH4, Cl, Na, K, Ca, Mg, HNO3, HONO, SO2, NH3, HCl.  From Trace-Level Gas Analyzers:  SO2, CO, NO, NOy.  Deliverable: Draft report on the effects of seasonality, missing data, and any other  significant factor detected by statistical tests or by other means on each currently measured and new parameter identified in Tables 1 and 2 and for each averaging period (day, week, month, and annual). Due: Eight weeks from award of this purchase order.	 Deliverable: Final report on the effects of  seasonality, missing data, and any other significant factor detected by statistical tests or by other means on each currently measured and new parameter identified in Tables 1 and 2 and for each averaging period (day, week, month, and annual).  Due: Two weeks after receiving comments on draft from  COR.  Task #3: Uncertainty estimates for all measured parameters.  The contractor shall provide uncertainty estimates for each currently measured and new parameter identified in Task 2 and for each averaging period (day, week, month, and annual), accounting for the effects of seasonality, missing  data, and any other significant effect detected by statistical tests or by other means.  For each currently measured and new parameter identified in Task 2, the contractor shall also determine completeness criteria, i.e., how much missing data can be tolerated for a given level of uncertainty.  Deliverable: Draft hardcopy and Microsoft Word file for uncertainty analysis and completeness criteria.  Due: Eight weeks after completion of Task 2.  Deliverable: Final hardcopy and Microsoft Word file for uncertainty analysis and completeness criteria.  Due: Two weeks after receiving comments on  draft from COR.  Task #4: Improve Aggregation Estimates and Algorithms.  The contractor shall determine appropriate methodology to properly aggregate the data into daily, weekly, monthly and annual time periods for the data identified in Tables 1 and 2.  After COR approval of the aggregation  methodology, the contractor shall aggregate the data into daily, weekly, monthly and annual time periods.  The contractor shall develop software written in computer language acceptable to the COR to automate the aggregation process as much as possible.  Deliverable: Draft hardcopy and Microsoft  Word file of results; and draft CD, user guide, and source code for aggregation method.  The draft report shall also summarize and discuss the rationale for the methodology to properly aggregate the data.  Due: Six weeks after completion of Task 3.  Deliverable: Final hardcopy and Microsoft Word  file of results; and final CD, user guide, and source code for aggregation method.  Due: Two weeks after receiving comments on draft from COR.  Task #5: Quality Assurance Plan for DataMart.  The contractor shall develop quality assurance (QA) pseudo code for the emissions and CASTNET sections of  the CAMD DataMart.  The pseudo code will use statistically valid sampling and 'profiling' techniques.  The pseudo code will not evaluate every element in the DataMart; CAMD will provide a defined subset of database elements to be targeted.  On larger database objects the pseudo code should use  sampling techniques.  The contractor will provide expertise in systematic and/or stratified random sampling, outside expertise in Operations Management (particularly Acceptance Sampling), and other statistically based sampling techniques.  Examples of conditions the pseudo code should detect are:  aggregates not correlating to underlying data; values exceeding tolerances; distribution of values in a column exceeding tolerances; table record counts exceeding tolerances.  CAMD will provide the tolerances for each element tested.  Since the DataMart is aggregated from stack level hourly to unit  level annual the pseudo code should exploit the schema wherever possible to optimize performance.  The pseudo code will be used to develop procedures in the Oracle DBMS to output a monthly report identifying DataMart elements of concern.  The contractor shall test the pseudo code and modify it as  needed to improve accuracy or run time.  Implementation of the pseudo code in Oracle is not part of this task.  Deliverable: Draft hardcopy and Microsoft Word file of pseudo code.  Due: Eight weeks after completion of Task 4.  Deliverable: Final hardcopy and Microsoft Word file of pseudo code.   Due: Two weeks after receiving comments on draft from COR.  Task #6: Quality Assurance of Replica Data.  The contractor shall develop pseudo code to quality assure that database tables of emissions data (10M - 200M rows each) are exact replicas of the source tables.  The contractor shall provide  expertise in systematic and/or stratified random sampling, outside expertise in Operations Management (particularly Acceptance Sampling), and other statistically based sampling techniques.  This pseudo code will be used to develop procedures in the Oracle DBMS that will produce a weekly report with  the current status of replicated objects.  The contractor shall test the pseudo code and modify it as needed to improve accuracy or run time.  Implementation of the pseudo code in Oracle is not part of this task.  Deliverable: Draft hardcopy and Microsoft Word file of pseudo code.  Due: Two weeks  after completion of Task 5.  Deliverable: Final hardcopy and Microsoft Word file of pseudo code.  Due: Two weeks after receiving comments on draft from COR. Report Distribution List:  Send via e-mail (1) copy of monthly progress reports, (1) copy of all draft products and (2) copies of all final  products to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative: John Schakenbackh, schakenbackh.john@epa.gov.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Date of award through 4/28/06. Estimated Hours:  675 hours.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Research Contract Branch (RCB), plans to procure logistical support in preparation of an HBCU Contract Proposal Writing Workshop from Morehouse School of Medicine, 720 Westview Dr, Atlanta, GA  30310.  The purpose is to provide the selected institution’s faculty and staff tutorial instruction in the development of a response to a Request for Proposal (RFP), approaches to cost analyzes evaluation of proposals, and how to avoid fatal flaws.  Morehouse School of Medicine will provide all the necessary logistical support for the 4-day workshop for 30-40 participants selected from a variety of Minority Institutions primarily from the States of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama.  Historically Black Colleges, Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI’s) continue to play a significant role in the education of minorities, make outstanding intellectual and scientific contributions that are indispensable to the broader society, and serve as centers for ethnic and minority culture.  These institutions, however, have experienced difficulties in winning grants and contracts as a result of competitively issued Request for Proposals (RFP) for Research and Development Requirements (R&D) from the Federal and State Government and in many cases the private sector as well.  During the 1990 HBCU/MI’s comprised of approximately 12.7 percent of all U.S. Institutions conducting research and development, yet they receive less than 1.5 percent of the research dollars awarded to institutions of higher education.  The Morehouse School of Medicine shall: 1) contact the selected minority institutions and confirm as to whether their institution will be represented at the workshop;  2) secure adequate conference facilities including lodging as necessary for the attendees;  3) will provide all classroom materials, photocopying and assemble the workshop booklets; and 4) supply the use of a computer lab for two afternoon sessions.  Morehouse School of Medicine is the only known source known to the NCI end user that can provide the necessary services required by the Agency.  Morehouse School of Medicine will provide all the services on their campus in Atlanta, GA.  The services will be performed by Morehouse School of Medicine staff and students.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI end user to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on July 1, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 611710; Size Standard is 6 million.

<DESC>Purpose
The Forest Service, an agency within the Department of Agriculture, seeks contractor services to provide management and technical support service for their e-Gov and Enterprise Architecture (EA) Programs.  The resulting contract will provide the Forest Service with a vehicle for fast and effective access to acquire state-of-the-art enterprise architecture services to support the Forest Service e-Gov EA initiatives.  This contract is an Indefinite Delivery Requirements type contract with provisions for Firm Fixed Price and Time and Material pricing arrangements under individual task orders. 

Background
As an agency of the United States Federal Government, the Forest Service understands the e-Government transformation objective as “the use of digital technologies to transform government operations in order to improve effectiveness, efficiency, and service delivery.” The Federal vision for electronic government is “an order of magnitude improvement in the federal government’s value to the citizen; with decisions in minutes or hours, not weeks or months.” The progress made within the Forest Service’s e-Gov EA endeavor will have a direct correlation to how well the agency transitions to delivering information and services in electronic form over the Internet. Succeeding in this effort will require a detailed understanding of the value chains that now support the agency’s information and service delivery, as well as the ability to modify these value chains to achieve the desired results, where necessary.
The Forest Service is comprised of more than 35,000 permanent employees and over 100,000 seasonal and volunteer employees making it the largest agency within the Department of Agriculture (USDA). As part of this larger enterprise and mission, the Forest Service EA and e-Gov strategies, tactics, and operations must fit within the USDA and federal level EA and e-Gov strategies, tactics, and operations.
For each initiative area, the Forest Service e-Gov roadmap describes the dimensions of business needs, or opportunities, along with the e-Gov “foundation” technologies that can be employed to meet these needs or capitalize on opportunities. There are 14 foundation technologies identified in the roadmap, many of which the USDA and the Forest Service does not yet own or license. Each Forest Service e-Gov initiative area can benefit from employing an average of nine of the foundation technologies, and each such technology has been identified as having promise to support e-Gov transformation for an average of 12 to 13 initiative areas. These statistics represent, as does the balance of the Forest Service e-Gov Strategy and Roadmap, a very high level of analysis. To prove the vision and projections of the roadmap requires additional detailed business line modernization analysis. 
This detailed analysis should link the Forest Service mission, vision, goals, and objectives (strategic intent) within an initiative area to adjustments in the value chains of the Forest Service, its partners, its suppliers, and its customers. Adjustments are made to targeted value chains by adding, modifying, or terminating their component processes, and so strategic objectives can be achieved. Value chain adjustments capable of supporting Forest Service e-Gov strategies will need to be identified by analyzing the ability of e-Gov/e-Business technologies to enable more efficient ways to deliver government goods and services and also to enhance these goods and services by adding to and improving the information content embedded in them.

The period of performance for this contract is a base of two years from October 1, 2005, and up to three (3) one (1) year options.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>USACE, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory, proposes to issue a sole source award to Oceanweather, Inc., 5 River Rd., Ste. 1, Cos Cob, CT  06807-2717.  The purpose of the proposed work is to complete the  forensic study for the North Pacific Basin and produce accurate wind fields needed for input to the hindcast modeling system.   TASK 1:  Complete Forensic Study.  The forensic study for the North Pacific Basin will be completed by utilizing the updated QuikSCAT data base to estimate the systematic wind speed and direction errors in background wind fields, west and east the Internat ional Dateline Statistical algorithms will be applied to minimize such errors insofar as possible and will be applied to the complete year 2000 wind fields and delivered as so called Level 2 winds fields (Tasks 2 and 3). TASK 2:  Process Setup and Generation of basin-scale Wind Fields for Year 2000.  Basin-scale wind fields for all months of 2000 will be generated for use in testing numerical models and model set-up.  Wind fields will cover area from Latitude -64.0 to +64. 0 and Longitude 110.0 East to 60.0 West with 0.5R  resolution at temporal resolutions of 3-hour.  Winds will be adjusted with full N. Pacific QuikSCAT corrections (Task 1), converted to neutral stability, and be blended to the WIS grid using IOKA.  Tropica l cyclones will be blended over the full domain at the IOKA step.  A special wind field for March of 2000 will include all the previous adjustments plus buoy integration and kinematic analysis for 9 storms. TASK 3:  Generation of 9 Years of Wind Fields.  Applying the process established in Task 2, nine additional years of basin-scale wind fields will be generated to complete ten years (1995-2004) of wind fields.  Wind fields will cover area from Latitude -64. 0 to +64.0 and Longitude 110.0 East to 60.0 West with 0.5R  resolution at temporal resolutions of 3-hour.  Winds will be adjusted using full N. Pacific QuikSCAT corrections, converted to neutral stability, and be blended to the WIS grid using IOKA.  Tropic al cyclones will be blended over the full domain at the IOKA step. Service Delivery and Summary.  The deliverable will be in the form of digital wind fields described in Tasks 2 and 3 and provided on a CDROM.  The wind fields should be delivered no later than 30 June 2005. A firm-fixed price award will be made utilizing the Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

SCOPE:  The PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) conducted a Government/Industry Pipeline R&D Forum in Houston, Texas on March 22 - 24, 2005. The 2.5 day event included approximately 185 representatives from Federal, State and international government agencies, public representatives, research funding organizations, standards organizations, and pipeline operators from the U.S. and Canada.  The R&D forum led to a common understanding of current research efforts, a listing of key challenges facing government and industry, and a compilation of potential research areas whose exploration can help meet these challenges and should therefore be considered in the development of new R&D applications. Only topics described in this BAA and identified at the R&D forum will be addressed.  Not all topics identified at the R&D forum fit within the mission of the OPS at this time and may not be represented in this BAA.  Further details on the research topics identified can be found in the R&D forum proceedings and technical report-out presentations.  To view the R&D forum proceedings and technical report-out presentations, please visit: http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/rd/mtg_032305.htm. 

To gain a historical prospective of the OPS R&D research goals, strategy and several previous pipeline stakeholder events as well as descriptions of all awarded research, visit the OPS R&D Program webpage at http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/rd/index.htm .  

Measuring how research outputs are transferred to the end user is a top priority for OPS R&D Program.  This BAA seeks research topics that: 1) Can produce results in the short-term (1-3 years), 2) Have progressed successfully past the proof of concept, 3) Contribute to the development of technology, strengthen consensus standards, or 4) Provide general knowledge for decision makers.  A response to this BAA must 1) Clearly identify the ultimate goals of the proposed project; or 2) Contribute technology or knowledge to organizations that supply technology in the field or to organizations seeking to develop or update industry consensus standards.  

The US DOT PHMSA is seeking white papers on individual projects and on consolidated R&D programs that address the following pipeline safety program areas.  A consolidated R&D program white paper from the team lead organization should identify opportunities for integrated R&D that could involve contributions from several organizations whose combined expertise will contribute greater efficiency and effectiveness to R&D in the proposed program areas.  Examples of program and project focus within the desired program areas are presented below.  Details of the intent of the listed projects can be located in the R&D forum proceedings and technical report-out presentations, shown at: http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/rd/mtg_032305.htm. 

1.  Damage Prevention --   

Technology development of avoidance sensors on digging/boring equipment - A project could identify current technologies to be refined or a new tool or avoidance sensor to be developed.  As part of the R&D, end users of this technology should be identified and provide technical specifications to develop best practice guidelines and increase the chances that the research output will be applied.  One Call procedures and pertinent insurance standards used by the pipeline industry could be factored to flow chart the entire process for the application of the technology.

2.  Mechanical Damage -- 

Enhance & validate Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) inspection technology for locating existing mechanical damage - A project could enhance assessment for qualitative screening and ranking of existing mechanical damage.  Field validation under real operating conditions could be used to benchmark the application of this tool or method. 

3.  Direct Assessment --

A.  Identify, develop and demonstrate tools and techniques to fill the gaps and expand the applicability of External Corrosion Direct Assessment (ECDA) - A project could survey existing technologies for applicability and short term potential.  Expand and demonstrate capability and reliability of the existing technologies identified without duplicating any existing efforts underway; or create new knowledge and technology to address the specific problem and capture applications in standard and/or recommended practice.  In any event, submitted projects must contribute to expanding the range of applicability of ECDA and to the demonstration of the effectiveness of ECDA in these expanded areas.
 
B.  Characterize the accuracy and range and applicability of Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA) methods and characterize which models apply to what situations - A project could survey existing technologies and methodologies for applicability, and develop protocols on how to apply ICDA methods. The candidate ICDA methods and protocols should lead (especially those focused on wet gas and liquids) to quantifying and validating the accuracy, applicability and functionality of the models evaluated.  The project results can be incorporated into a standard and/or recommended practice.

C.  Identify and develop practical approaches to characterize the impact of and reduce the number of uncertainties in Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA) application - A project could pinpoint locations and optimize length of ICDA excavations.  It could survey existing technologies and methodologies and applicability.  The project could develop protocols, demonstrate ICDA methods (especially those focused on wet gas and liquids) and incorporate results into existing standards. 

D.  Identify, develop, demonstrate tools and techniques for expanding their applicability and ability to detect Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) - A project should survey existing technologies for applicability and short term potential.  Expand and demonstrate capability and reliability of the existing technologies identified without duplicating any existing efforts underway; or create new knowledge and technology to address the specific problem and capture application in standard and/or recommended practice.

4.  Inspection -- 

A.  Investigate fundamentals and performance characteristics of current sensor technologies - A project could identify current capabilities of many inspection technologies used in the pipeline industry.  Currently there is a growing need to validate the data and assessment information captured during inline inspection while tying these results back to fundamentals and performance characteristics.

B.  Developing inspection technologies for non-metallic pipelines - A project could identify current technologies available to inspect non-metallic pipe.  Technology gaps identified could be used to develop technologies that will inspect these pipes in the methods and techniques similar to metallic pipelines.

5.  Leak Detection --

Enhancement of tools for computational pipeline monitoring - A project could identify how computational monitoring for leak detection can be enhanced through the development of new tools or methods.  The project could incorporate technology development with best practice guidelines to maximize effectiveness.

6.  Pipeline Design --

A.  Conduct testing to support a comprehensive set of design tools for pipeline strain based design - A project could provide engineering data to support and validate the existing government and industry research effort for strain based design.  The current effort has drafted a comprehensive design standard for strain based design.  Much of the guidance drafted from this research requires engineering data to support this standard.

B.  Improve predictive tools for pipeline loading under large scale movement and adverse environmental conditions - A project could consider a comprehensive investigation to address all associated engineering issues.  The current methodology for predicting loads on pipelines is not sufficient, particularly with regard to large scale ground movements and environmentally imposed loads. Further, the project could incorporate material and site property data to support application of predictive tools. 

7.  Other Safety Improvements --

A.  E-Communications – A project could work with public safety agencies, “One Call” centers, and the telecommunications industry to integrate voice, data, geospatial and graphical communications to enable common devices (cell phones, PDAs, computers, and others) to communicate effectively.

B.  Human Factors -  A project could discuss research on operator fatigue, human-centered systems, and man machine interaction. Research topics of interest include technologies and procedures designed to minimize operator error, research on the effects of managing pipeline controller shift change and potential solutions for minimizing those effects, human interface in incident/accident management, and other portions of the pipeline operating system.  An exisitng government and industry research should be coordinatded with to maximixe attainment of this topic’s goal. 

WHITE PAPERS: PHMSA is soliciting white papers on individual projects as well as consolidated R&D programs in support of the specified program areas.  Each proposal must include a cost sharing contribution of at least fifty percent of the proposed project's cost in order to be considered. Each white paper must not exceed five pages and must include the following:  1) A description of the state-of-the-art in the area being proposed; 2) Actions proposed to advance that state with a quantifiable method to measure the improvement anticipated upon completion of the project; 3) Examples of past performance that demonstrate the ability of an offeror to compete further from white papers to proposals; and 4) Examples, if any, of prior awarded research with DOT.   The entire White Paper submission package, including the White Paper itself (5 pages maximum), and all attachments, appendices and backup materials, must not exceed fifteen pages in total.  The package must include the contact information previously described, and sufficient information to evaluate the following areas: 
1. Offeror’s understanding and description of the state of the art in the proposed research area.
The degree to which the offeror identifies the current status of the technology in the research area it is proposing to address, including previous work done by the offeror and others in the proposed R&D area and appropriateness of how the prior work relates to the proposed application of the technology. Adequacy and feasibility of the applicant’s approach to achieving stated objectives.
2. Scientific and technical merit of proposal to advance pipeline safety.
The degree to which the proposed technology or methodology is based on sound scientific and engineering principles. The degree to which the proposal will advance pipeline safety, if the work is successful. 
3. Adequacy and feasibility of technical approach and realism of cost estimate.
Appropriateness, rationale, and completeness of the applicant's technical approach. The adequacy of the proposed project schedule, staffing plan and planned travel to complete the proposed work. The realism of the cost estimate to meet objectives and deliver products in the proposed timeline. The likelihood that the proposed work will be successful and develop a new successful technology.
4. Technical experience and capabilities of the offeror in Federal research programs.
Credentials, capabilities and experience of key personnel. Demonstrated corporate experience of the applicant and participating organizations in managing similar projects that are similar to the proposal in size, complexity, and technology. The adequacy of the facilities and equipment to perform project tasks.
5. Timeline to implement proposed technologies or concepts into practice into the pipeline industry. 
Overall potential timeline of the proposed technology to become an accepted commercial product if work is successful.
6. State of the application and coordination and collaboration with end users to implement proposed technologies or concepts into the pipeline industry. (Criteria to be used during full proposal evaluation only)
If applicable, the proposed research should identify whether the deliverable addresses technology or consensus standards.  The offeror could include scope items that coordinate with standard organizations and or vendor technology organizations increasing the chance that project results will be applied or commercialized.  Items such as invitations to project meetings, providing copies of milestone reports and drafting project outputs in formats recognized with that organization are suggested. The offeror could provide clarity, logic and likely effectiveness of project organization including subcontractors to successfully complete the project.  
7. As appropriate, information on capabilities of the lead company and other collaborators expected to participate in consolidated R&D Programs. (Criterion to be used during full proposal evaluation of Consolidated Programs only)
PHMSA is looking for the increased scientific and technical merit of the consolidated program itself versus that of its individual projects. We are looking not simply for project management assistance, but for the increased value added by adopting a more integrated approach to addressing a known technical challenge to pipeline safety. Therefore, successful proposals for consolidated programs will clearly articulate both how the individual technical projects interrelate and are sequenced to maximize the benefits. Such proposals will also clearly articulate how the proposed approach will deliver significantly greater improvements in either knowledge or technical solutions to clearly identified challenges than if these projects were pursued individually or in a different sequence; the adequacy and availability of the personnel, facilities and equipment to perform project tasks; and the demonstrated corporate experience of the applicant and participating organizations in managing similar projects.

All evaluation factors are of equal importance.

Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.

<DESC>The following is answers to questions that have been received.  
1.  The integrated testing is very simple.  All of the IEEE-488 GPIB equipped items are connected together and then to one of the interface cards of the PATEC computer.  Then the NI Measurement and Automation software is used to scan for instruments on the busIt prevents bad GPIB interfaces on the instruments from being delivered.
2. If a substitute for the operating and transit cases are proposed, submit OEM data on the new cases for evaluation.  Additionally, unless you can produce from the potential case vendor documentation on the testing described in the PD, offers will have to have the testing done.   
3.  If an alternate computer is proposed, it must meet the technical requirements. The KEY requirements are 
A laptop 
Windows 2000 or XP 
Two USB ports 
A CD drive 
A floppy drive 
 The above does not change any part of the PD, but shows where our main concerns are, you must still make sure it meets the PD requirements.  Minor variations in size are of no concern, but it is the contractor’s responsibility to ensure it fits in the case for the computer.  
4.  Authorization to purchase through GSA schedules may be given.
Date for receipt of offers is 23 Jun 2005

<SUBJECT>D -- E-Government Enterprise Architecture Technical and Management Services for the USDA Forest Service
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-egov2005
<CONTACT>Steven Schmidt, Procurement Analyst, Phone 703-605-4628, Fax 703-605-5100, Email sjschmidt@fs.fed.us
<DESC>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice - the Request for Proposals will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunity website, (FedBizOps), at www.fbo.gov, on or about July 5, 2005.

Purpose
The Forest Service, an agency within the Department of Agriculture, seeks contractor services to provide management and technical support service for their e-Gov and Enterprise Architecture (EA) Programs.  The resulting contract will provide the Forest Service with a vehicle for fast and effective access to acquire state-of-the-art enterprise architecture services to support the Forest Service e-Gov EA initiatives.  This contract is an Indefinite Delivery Requirements type contract with provisions for Firm Fixed Price and Time and Material pricing arrangements under individual task orders. 

Background
As an agency of the United States Federal Government, the Forest Service understands the e-Government transformation objective as “the use of digital technologies to transform government operations in order to improve effectiveness, efficiency, and service delivery.” The Federal vision for electronic government is “an order of magnitude improvement in the federal government’s value to the citizen; with decisions in minutes or hours, not weeks or months.” The progress made within the Forest Service’s e-Gov EA endeavor will have a direct correlation to how well the agency transitions to delivering information and services in electronic form over the Internet. Succeeding in this effort will require a detailed understanding of the value chains that now support the agency’s information and service delivery, as well as the ability to modify these value chains to achieve the desired results, where necessary.
The Forest Service is comprised of more than 35,000 permanent employees and over 100,000 seasonal and volunteer employees making it the largest agency within the Department of Agriculture (USDA). As part of this larger enterprise and mission, the Forest Service EA and e-Gov strategies, tactics, and operations must fit within the USDA and federal level EA and e-Gov strategies, tactics, and operations.
For each initiative area, the Forest Service e-Gov roadmap describes the dimensions of business needs, or opportunities, along with the e-Gov “foundation” technologies that can be employed to meet these needs or capitalize on opportunities. There are 14 foundation technologies identified in the roadmap, many of which the USDA and the Forest Service does not yet own or license. Each Forest Service e-Gov initiative area can benefit from employing an average of nine of the foundation technologies, and each such technology has been identified as having promise to support e-Gov transformation for an average of 12 to 13 initiative areas. These statistics represent, as does the balance of the Forest Service e-Gov Strategy and Roadmap, a very high level of analysis. To prove the vision and projections of the roadmap requires additional detailed business line modernization analysis. 
This detailed analysis should link the Forest Service mission, vision, goals, and objectives (strategic intent) within an initiative area to adjustments in the value chains of the Forest Service, its partners, its suppliers, and its customers. Adjustments are made to targeted value chains by adding, modifying, or terminating their component processes, and so strategic objectives can be achieved. Value chain adjustments capable of supporting Forest Service e-Gov strategies will need to be identified by analyzing the ability of e-Gov/e-Business technologies to enable more efficient ways to deliver government goods and services and also to enhance these goods and services by adding to and improving the information content embedded in them.

The single contract awarded will be an Indefinite Delivery Requirements type.  The period of performance for this contract is a base of two years from October 1, 2005, and up to three (3) one (1) year options.

<DESC>Research and Development Sources Sought
Advanced Materials, Manufacturing, and Testing Information Analysis Center (AMMTIAC)

This is a Sources Sought synopsis.  In accordance with FAR Part 5.205, Special Situations, FAR Part 10, Market Research, and FAR Part 35, Research and Development, this Sources Sought synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to determine qualified sources capable of providing Advanced Materials, Manufacturing and Testing Information Analysis Center (AMMTIAC) for the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC).  The Government intends to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract with a potential performance period of 8 years.  If the Primary requirement (as detailed below) can be filled, submit only one package in response to this sources sought.  If it is determined that this requirement will be done as two contracts, those responses shall be considered as interested in both parts, unless specifically annotated otherwise.  The Government prefers to award one contract (Primary Proposal); however, based upon responses, the Government may award two contracts if it's in the Government's best interest (Alternate Proposal).

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  

Information Analysis Center (IAC):  The Department of Defense (DoD) Information Analysis Center (IAC) Program operates in accordance with DoD 3200.14, Principles and Operational Parameters of the DoD Scientific and Technical Information Program, 13 May 1997.

<DESC>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. This announcement is conducting a market survey to identify qualified vendors capable of meeting Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Emanations Countermeasures Branch/Countermeasures Program requirements for a shatter-resistant radio frequency shielding window film.  This window film will be applied to the windows of existing structures to provide enhanced physical and technical security.  At a minimum, the window film must meet the following criteria:

1. General Specifications:
The shatter-resistant radio frequency shielding window film shall be polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, or a composite.  The film shall be 8 mm (5/16 inch) thick or provide the equivalent strength.  The film shall be optically clear and free of waves, distortions, impurities, and adhesive lines.  The film may be single layer or laminated.  Lamination of the film shall occur only at the factory of the shatter-resistant film manufacturer.  The film shall include an abrasion resistant coating on the surface that does not receive the film adhesive.  The film shall be supplied with an optically clear weatherable pressure sensitive adhesive.  The adhesive shall contain ultraviolet inhibitors to protect the film for its required life and shall limit ultraviolet transmission to not more than 8 percent of the radiation between 300 and 380 nanometers.  Infrared opacity/scattering properties in the film are desired.  The film must be able to be applied to existing ballistic windows without adversely affecting the ballistic or optical characteristics of those windows.  The adhesive shall not be water activated.  A water detackifier and/or release liner may be incorporated over the adhesive to facilitate film application.  The adhesive shall be 90 percent cured within 30 days of installation.  The following tests to indicate compliance with specified requirements shall be performed by an independent testing laboratory, and a responsible official of the laboratory shall sign the laboratory reports.

2. Impact Performance:
The shatter-resistant radio frequency shielding window film shall be tested for impact in accordance with ANSI Z97.1 at 400 ft-lbf impact level or 16 CFR 1201, Category II.  Tests shall be conducted on window film applied to 3.1 mm (1/8 inch) to 6.4 mm (1/4 inch) thick annealed flat glass which conforms to the requirements of ASTM C 1036, Type I, Class I, Quality q3.  In addition, the film tested shall be applied to the glass with a minimum of 6 mm (1/4 inch) to a maximum of 19 mm (3/4 inch) splice located at the midpoint of the specimen.  Sketches showing the location and configuration of splice shall be included in submitted certified test reports.  After the impact portion of the test is conducted, satisfactory performance of the test specimens shall be determined using ANSI Z97.1, paragraphs 5.1.3 or 16 CFR 1201, paragraph 1201.4 (e)- INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS.  To be qualified for use under this specification, the manufacturer shall provide a report that the shatter-resistant window film satisfactorily performed in accordance with ANSI Z97.1, paragraph 5.1.3 (1), (3), or (4) or with 16 CFR 1201, paragraph 1204.4 (e) (1) (i), (iv), or (v).  ANSI Z97.1, paragraph 5.1.3 (2) or 16 CFR 1201, paragraph 1204.4 (e) (1) (ii) shall not constitute passing criteria.

3. Tensile Strength:
The shatter-resistant radio frequency shielding window film samples tested shall exhibit a minimum tensile strength at break of 172.4 MPa (25,000 pounds per square inch) when tested in accordance with ASTM D 882.  Method A, Static Weighting, Constant Rate of Grip Separation Test, shall be used to conduct this test.  The rate of grip separation shall not exceed 0.85 mm/s (2 inches per minute).

4. Peel Strength:
Testing shall be conducted following 1,200 hours accelerated weathering exposure per ASTM G 26 Procedure B.  The shatter-resistant radio frequency shielding window film shall exhibit minimum peel strength of 790 N/m (4.5 pounds/inch) when tested in accordance with ASTM D 3330.  Method A shall be used to conduct the tests.  A glass substrate shall be used and a maximum dwell time of 45 days is permitted.

5. Puncture Strength:
The shatter-resistant radio frequency shielding window film samples tested shall exhibit minimum puncture strength of 130 pounds average when tested in accordance with ASTM D 4830.

6. Surface Abrasion:
The shatter-resistant radio frequency shielding window film shall exhibit a change in haze not to exceed 3.2 percent following 100 turns, using 500 gram weights on a CS 10F abrasive wheel when tested in accordance with ASTM D 1044.

7. Flame Spread and Smoke Density:
The shatter-resistant radio frequency shielding window film shall exhibit a flame spread index not exceeding 25 and a smoke density index not exceeding 100 when tested in accordance with ASTM E 84.

<SUBJECT>SSP HBCU/MI Technology Research Opportunties
<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) I. INTRODUCTION 1. General. This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Department of the Navy, Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 35.016.  A formal request for proposals (RFP) or solicitation regarding this BAA will not be issued.  Paper copies of this BAA will not be issued.  2. Set-Aside. This procurement is a total set-aside for historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCU/MIs). 3. Background. SSP is interested in obtaining white papers and full proposals through this BAA for the research opportunities described below under its HBCU/MI Technology Research Opportunities Program (the HBCU/MI Program).  The HBCU/MI Program will consist of two phases.  Phase I is expected to last for four to six months and result in the provision of feasibility studies for the research opportunities.  Phase II is expected to last for up to two years and result in the provision of laboratory demonstrations and reports for the research opportunities.  This BAA relates only to the first phase of the HBCU/MI program, except as otherwise indicated below.  The government expects to award one or more Phase I contracts as a result of this BAA.  It is estimated that each proposed feasibility study selected for award of a contract under Phase I will be funded in an amount of up to $20,000. A Phase I feasibility study may lead to award of a contract for work for up to two years in Phase II of the HBCU/MI program.  It is estimated that each proposed project selected for award of a contract under Phase II will be funded in an amount of up to $80,000 for the first year and up to $80,000 for the second year. 4.  Program Name   SSP HBCU/MI Technology Research Opportunities 5.   Research Opportunity Titles A. Peel and Stick Adhesive (HB04-1) B. Non-Volatile, Non-Destructive Read-Out Memories (HB04-2) C. Inertial Navigators’ Algorithm (HB04-3) D. High Temperature Protective Insulation (HB04-4) E. Alternate/Low Cost Replacement Heatshield and Nosetip Materials (HB04-5) F. Shock and Vibration Mitigation for a Navigation System (HB04-6) 6.  Research Opportunity Numbers  Numbers HB04-01 through HB04-06 as noted in “Description of Research Opportunities” below. II.  DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES  HB04-1: Peel and Stick Adhesive.  Develop a peel and stick adhesive backing for the Trident missile launcher lateral support urethane pads.  Installation of the current urethane pads is time-consuming, costly and requires special handling measures.  A two-part epoxy containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is used to adhere the pads to the launch tube.  Personnel working with the current epoxy must wear respirators and other personal protective equipment (PPE).  For safety and health reasons, in areas where the epoxy is being used, a “stay-out zone” is established where no other operations may be performed.  After pad application, the excess epoxy adhesive remaining around the lateral support pad is removed, which requires the use of VOCs.  An adhesive-backed polyurethane pad would overcome these limitations.  In addition, it would decrease the pad application time, since there will be no need to mix the two-part adhesive and no excess adhesive to remove after applicatio! n. The design must maximize the use of COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) items using the current urethane Trident II pads.  The lateral support peel and stick system will be capable of adhering the lateral support urethane pads to the steel launch tube with a maximum friction peel pressure (pressure averaged over the pad bond area (psi) times a 3.0 factor of safety) of 10.29 psi.  Additionally, the lateral shock pads shall be capable of being set up in the tube in less than 1/5 the time it takes to set the lateral support pads with the current two-component adhesive.   HB04-2: Non-Volatile, Non-Destructive Read-Out Memories.  Develop non-volatile, non-destructive read-out memories (NV-NDRO) that are radiation-hardened to replace existing unsupported plated wire memory.  Plated wire has been used in the past for non-volatile memory, but it is no longer manufactured.  Other technologies, such as ferroelectric memory, giant magnetoresistive and calcogenide, which are being developed for commercial use, need further development to operate in a strategic environment. HB04-3: Inertial Navigators’ Algorithm.  Develop an algorithm that uses data from three inertial navigators to optimize navigation reliability, performance and redundancy.  The algorithm must account for the permutations of combining or not combining data such that accuracy is enhanced while avoiding the possibility of data from one navigator corrupting the other.  Presently the Strategic Systems navigation subsystem has two Electrostatically Supported Gyro Navigators (ESGNs). Based on his own judgment and guidelines, the navigator chooses one of these as a System Master inertial navigator. The System Master provides the data to applications and to the Fire Control System. Except for Difference Monitoring, which subtracts and compares the two inertial navigator outputs for diagnostic purposes, data from the two systems are not mixed. From a statistical information content viewpoint, mixing data from the two systems should enable more accurate navigation information. On the o! ther hand, it may open the possibility of one system corrupting the other. With the possibility of three inertial navigators for the Fiber Optic Gyro Navigator (FOGN) based navigation subsystem, the permutations of combining (or not combining) data from the navigators can be more complex. So the objective is to develop an algorithm that uses data from three inertial navigators to optimize navigation reliability, performance and redundancy. HB04-4: High Temperature Protective Insulation. As the propellant in the Post Boost Control System burns, the protective insulation between the propellant and its container experiences high temperatures, gas pressures and flow rates.  The resulting ablation carries charred silica particles of the insulation and adhesives through the valves of the control system tending to foul the valves’ orifices thereby degrading control of the gas pressure.  An insulation material is needed that has effective thermal properties but does not produce valve clogging. HB04-5: Alternate/Low Cost Replacement Heatshield and Nosetip Materials. Development of alternate/low-cost replacement heatshield and nosetip materials is needed for extending the life of reentry bodies.  A goal of the replacement materials is to produce drop-in replacements that, relative to the current Navy SLBM reentry body materials, induce the same or better reentry body performance. In some performance areas, below-nominal response may be acceptable if innovative design techniques exist that can mitigate their influence on reentry body performance. One such area may be reentry body roll control. Recent ground testing indicates that some of the new fibers and/or manufacturing methods that appear attractive for reducing cost may induce roll torque coefficients that may degrade reentry body performance. To maintain these fibers and low cost concepts as viable candidates, an innovative design technique is needed that can control the roll rate of a reentry body during SLBM ! reentry. The concept must not allow the body to spin through zero, nor spin up to a critical roll resonance. The concept must have minimal impact on the current systems.   HB04-6: Shock and Vibration Mitigation for a Navigation System. A new inertial navigation system for use on submarines is in development. Each submarine may have as many as three of these systems, and space on the existing bedplates is a major concern. An innovative, cost effective solution to the following trade space is needed: mitigate shock and vibration while minimizing the space (including sway space reserve) and maintaining attitude (angular position) relative to the original position of the unit prior to the shock or vibration event.  So the objective is to develop a shock isolation system suitable for use on a submarine. The system must support a weight of 300-400 pounds and suppress shock and vibration while minimizing space.

<SUBJECT>R -- EDUCATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE REPORTING SYSTEM (EARS)
<DESC>Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) needs to add additional tasks to the Facilitation and Logistical Support for the FNS Workgroup on Food Stamp Nutrition Education.  These additional tasks would allow the Education and Administrative Reporting System (EARS) workgroup to continue to capture final follow-up information from participants in the EARS field test and provide an additional opportunity for participants to voice their experience in preparing for and completing the EARS form during the pilot.  FNS feels this information is needed by the workgroup to fully understand State’s experiences in using the form and will aid the workgroup in further refining the EARS form and preparing for a smooth implementation of EARS in the future.

Tasks

Task 1.1 – Prepare Discussion Outlines

The contractor, with the assistance of FNS, shall prepare an outline for discussions to be conducted in each of the six (6) states participating in the pilot test.  The outline shall include a brief overview of preliminary pilot results and questions to facilitate a group discussion on participant’s experience in collecting data for the new reporting form for the pilot test and any recommendations they have for changes.  The contractor shall prepare one draft and a final version of the outline for each state.

Task 1.2 – Schedule and Facilitate Discussions 

The contractor shall coordinate all aspects of organizing, scheduling and facilitating face-to-face discussions in the six (6) pilot states.  The discussions will take place in one location per state but in the larger states such at California, Illinois and New York more than one meeting shall be anticipated to take place on the same day (a morning session and an afternoon session) dependent upon interest and travel needs of participants.   It is anticipated that each discussion will last approximately 2 hours.  The discussions will include State, implementing and local agency personnel who attended the discussions conducted in preparation for the pilot test and a list of these attendees will be provided by FNS.  The contractor shall coordinate these discussions with FNS and provide a schedule of the meetings at least 2 weeks (10 working days) in advance including logistic arrangements, agenda and any summary documents.
  
Task 1.3 – Complete Summary Memos

After the additional discussions are completed in each state, the contractor shall prepare a summary memo of major themes discussed and recommendations received.  The contractor will prepare one draft and a final version of each summary memo (one per state).

FNS intends to award a follow-on modification to purchase order number 43-3198-3-0113, to Phelan-Gregory Consulting, Inc. for continued support to the Education and Administration Reporting System (EARS) on a sole source basis, citing the authority fo FAR 6.302-1(B).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-05-Q-625749 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is total small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 721110.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau has released the final Field Data Collection Automation (FDCA) Request for Proposal (RFP) on June 17, 2005. This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15. The website for this acquisition is located at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/fdca/index.html

The Census Bureau serves as the leading source of quality data about the nation's people and economy.  Every 10 years on April 1st, the Census Bureau conducts a Census of Population and Housing under authority of Title 13, U.S. Code.  The Census Bureau will conduct the next decennial Census in the year 2010. 

The goal of the Field Data Collection Automation (FDCA) program is to facilitate and support our field staff's collection of high quality census data in an effecient and cost-effective manner.     The Census Bureau must accomplish these data collection activities through the deployment and operation of IT systems that meet stringent performance, timing, security, and confidentiality requirements for the 2010 Census.     The systems will support the data collection activities of Census Bureau enumerators and local census officers during both the 2008 dress rehearsal and the 2010 Census.     During the 2010 Census the FDCA system will support approximately 450+ temporary offices, and a peak staff of approximately 500,000 enumerators.

The Census Bureau plans to acquire the services of a Prime Systems Integrator who can develop, implement, and manage the systems (applications, equipment, local area networks, telecommunications) and provide the supporting services (maintenance, training, logistical support, monitoring, etc.) required to conduct field data collection operations for the 2010 Decennial Census.

S. Government Accountability Office at its headquarters in Washington DC originally posted in the FedBizOpps on June 1, 2005 to include the following questions received by GAO and GAO’s responses.   1. Question - What qualifies as a Senior Electrician? 	 Response - See Section II A 2   2. Question -When you state Senior Electrician, do you mean Senior Technician? The qualifications stated in Section II, A meet those of a Senior Technician?   Response - No.  We are asking for a senior electrician.   3. Question - If you mean electrician, do they need an electrician license for DC?	   Response - See Section II A 3, which states:  “shall have certificates of training, licenses, proper insurance, and permits as required by the District of Columbia”   4. Question - In providing the Electrician/Technician may we rotate personnel to work on the contract testing, etc? We feel rotating personnel would be more beneficial for us to familiarize our on call staff and other technicians with your facility.  This would also allow our people to be "fresh" in there work environment?    Response – Yes   5. Question -What constitutes a "True emergency" for emergency service calls?   Response - A true emergency would be determined by the COTR, such as, but not limited to the loss of the fire system on a floor or floors or the entire building, or a leaking flow switch.   6. Question - In responding to an emergency service call after-hours or during normal business hours, do we have to have SimplexGrinnell personnel respond in the same time frame as the contractor?   Response - No    7.Question - Some parts may not be available with in 24-48 hours from the manufactures will there be any grace period for providing those parts?   Response - See Section II C 10 “The COTR reserves the right to furnish to the contractor parts or materials required to repair the system.  If the work is under an approved time and materials task, then the contractor shall be responsible to order and replace all loaned devices.  If GAO does not require the contractor to replace the loaned devices (s) then the contractor will bill GAO for time and other materials supplied by the contractor.”   Yes there will be a grace period.   8. Question -.  Will GAO provide a second able bodied person to assist in testing the Fire Alarm System, or is the winning contractor required to provide only ONE person to perform the needed inspections? (Typically it takes TWO people to perform a proper Fire Alarm Inspection and you only have one designated for this contract)?   Response - No.  The daily on-site senior electrician will perform the needed inspections.   9. Question -The hours you estimated, are they firm or can we adjust them?   Response - No.  All hours are estimated.  However, the on-site hours for the senior electrician are based on an annual work year of 2080 hours.   10. Question - Please provide information on the Sprinkler System...Number of Dry Systems, Number of Wet Systems (including quantities of risers, tamper, and flow switches) the size of the Fire Pump in GPM.   Response - The sprinkler system including the fire pump is not within the scope of this contract.  This is maintained by the Commercial Facilities Management Contractor.  Only the tampers and flow switches are within the scope of this contract.   The flow switches and tampers switches are identified in Appendix 4 Fire System Addressable Device Location.   The fire pump capacity in GPM is 1500.    All firms that have requested and received a copy of the RFP addendum with additional contract requirements will receive a copy of this amendment document by email. Those firms that have not requested the RFP addendum (see Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Notice code 99 dated June 01, 2005), must request a copy by emailing Brandon Levin (Contract Specialist) (Levinb@gao.gov).

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 0003 to the combined synopsis-solicitation W91ZLK-05-R-0028 is to correct information on the engines and provide response to the questions submitted by potential offerors. CLIN 0003 Engine supplied by the Government is r evised to read:  the Caterpillar 3126B (5T) is 330 HP. CLIN 0004 the Caterpillar C7 is 330 HP. CLIN 0005 the Detroit 60 series is 400 HP. Questions and Answers follows: Q - How many Dynamometer Test Stands will be purchased. A - CLIN 0001 needs 3, CLIN 000 2 needs 3, CLIN 0003 needs 1, CLIN 0004 needs 1, CLIN 0005 needs 1 and CLIN 0007 needs 1 for the total amount of 10. Q - Will you accept wet gap eddy current dynamometers in place of hydraulic style? A - No. We would not like the wet gap eddy current dynam ometer. All Army tests are tabulated to run at full power, and there is no need for partial throttle power testing, which is the only difference between hydraulic inertia and wet gap current dynameters. The cost to repair them would be higher and they are much less dependable. Partial power dynos are OEM type for testing new equipment. The purpose of the dyno, is not to teach it, itself, but to simulate the road test that the student would give the piece of equipment out in the field, that we cannot do here  at the school, due to time, facilities, licenses and safety. We need a simple dyno, one that can be changed to another engine as time gives another power plant. Q - Will you accept a rebuilt wet gap eddy current dynamometer that comes with a 1-year warran ty? A - No. Q - Can the dynamometer be mounted to the floor and the engine mount to a cart also secured to the floor in relationship to the dynamometer? A - We are requiring for the dynamometer and the engine not to be mounted to the floor. Q - Should the dynamometer and engine throttle be controlled manually, or by computer? A - Depending on the engine type, it will need to be manual or electronic: For the 6V53T, the VTA903-T600 Cummins and the Detroit Diesel Allison 8V71T the throttle controlled is manual , for the Caterpillar 3126, the Caterpillar C7 and the Detroit 60 Series it is Electronic. Q - Will a fuel supply be provided by the Government with each system? (at final location) A - No, it needs to be mounted on the dynamometer. Q - Will storage batter ies and wiring be supplied by the Government for starting the engines? (at final location) A - The power source will come from GPU-units (Tesla) and engine harness for power source provided by Government. Q - Will engine exhaust systems be supplied by the Government? (at the final location) A - Yes. Q - How many temperature and pressure measurement channels are necessary? A - Coolant Temp (Gage), Overheating warning light, Engine oil pressure, Engine oil low pressure warning light. Q - Should the displays b e on a computer screen? A - N/A 9.) Are hoses to connect the engines to an engine cooling column to be supplied by the dyno company? A - Yes. Q - If the engines are turbocharged and intercooled are we to provide an air/water cooling system? A - Yes. Q - Is  each dynamometer to have a water re-circulation and cooling system? A - Yes. Q - If each dyno is to have a closed loop cooling system, then is an evaporative cooling tower required? A - No. Q - If the cooling tower is required, should it be sized for cont inuous duty at maximum HP? A - N/A. Q - If a closed loop system is required, are the water storage tank, the pumps, the motor starters for the pumps and the motor starter for the cooling tower to be included? A - Yes. Q - What are the power and torque and RPM ranges of the engines to be tested? A - For all engines we want to be able to test up too 2950 RPM and not to exceed 3050 RPM. Engine Type 6V53T, Power is 275 HP, and the Torque is 627 ft/lbs@1600 rpm; Engine Type VTA903-T600 Cummins, Power is 600 HP, and the Torque is Minimum - 1188 ft/lbs and the Maximum - 1236 ft/lbs; Engine Type Caterpillar 3126B  (5 T), Power is 330 HP, and the Torque is 1175; Engine Typ e Caterpillar C7, Power is 330 HP, and the Torque is 1100; Engine Type Detroit 60 Series, Power is 400 HP, and the Torque is 1350 ft/lbs@1200 rpm; Engine Detroit Diesel Allison 8V71T, Power is 440 HP and the Torque is 362 ft/lbs@2100 rpm.
