<DESC>The work to be performed is at the Mt. Elbert Powerplant, located approximately 20 miles south-southwest of Leadville, Colorado in Lake County.  Mt. Elbert Powerplant houses two 100 MW reversible-Francis pump-generator units.  Surfaces inside the air housing were contaminated with mineral oil when the oil mist collection system failed briefly several years ago.  The lighter hydrocarbons have since evaporated leaving a greasy residue which has collected and retained dirt, brake dust, carbon dust, and general dust.  The surface contamination is reducing the cooling efficiency and may be increasing the risk of winding failure.  The Government will disassemble the generator, remove the rotor and place it on the pedestal, to give the contractor easier access to the surfaces to be cleaned.  Once the contractor has completed the specified work, the Government will test the integrity of the stator and pole windings and reassemble the unit.  Testing of wipe samples taken from various surfaces within the air housing have confirmed the greasy residue is also contaminated with asbestos fibers and heavy metals.

<DESC>The work to be performed is at the Mt. Elbert Powerplant, located approximately 20 miles south-southwest of Leadville, Colorado in Lake County.  Mt. Elbert Powerplant houses two 100 MW reversible-Francis pump-generator units.  Surfaces inside the air housing were contaminated with mineral oil when the oil mist collection system failed briefly several years ago.  The lighter hydrocarbons have since evaporated leaving a greasy residue which has collected and retained dirt, brake dust, carbon dust, and general dust.  The surface contamination is reducing the cooling efficiency and may be increasing the risk of winding failure.  The Government will disassemble the generator, remove the rotor and place it on the pedestal, to give the contractor easier access to the surfaces to be cleaned.  Once the contractor has completed the specified work, the Government will test the integrity of the stator and pole windings and reassemble the unit.  Testing of wipe samples taken from various surfaces within the air housing have confirmed the greasy residue is also contaminated with asbestos fibers and heavy metals.  For this reason work areas will have to be enclosed and maintained at a negative pressure to prevent migration of these contaminates to other areas of the plant during the cleaning process.
The principle components of work under this solicitation includes the following:  1) Construct, operate, maintain, deconstruct, and dispose of temporary contaminate containment structures and worker hygiene facilities; 2) clean generator stator, rotor, upper guide bearing bracket, and thrust bracket.  Generator surfaces are contaminated with greasy residue that contains crysotile asbestos and heavy metal; 3) repair surface coatings using Government approved paint; and 4) dispose of waste materials as outlined in these specifications.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction.

This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307." One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of <strong>4/15/2013</strong>. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for an upgrade of a PerkinElmer (PE) Health Sciences Inc. System Thermal Analyzer.	The items being procured are:  STA 6000 System Thermal Analyzer, Qty 1, Polyscience Chiller (120V), Qty 1, PAN-TGA 4000/STA 6000 Pt/Rh 2.5mm (PK 5), Qty 1, Lenovo M81 Win 7-64 Tower, Qty 1, 17-inch LCD MM, Qty 1. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from PerkinElmer (PE) Health Sciences Inc., the manufacturer, on a sole source basis.  The PerkinElmer (PE) STA 6000 System is an upgrade to an existing GRC PerkinElmer DSC7 Analyzer.  The upgrade is compatible with existing PerkinElmer accessories (such as calibration reference materials, sample pans and a sample pan crimper press) and the existing inert gas delivery system (to include tubing, piping, gauges and connectors).  Since the new operating software is an updated version of the current analyzer's operating system, familiarity with the software reduces the need for onsite instruction.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. The sole source is under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i).

<a href="mailto:Susan.E.Mcclain@nasa.gov">Susan E. McClain</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for Research Services for Active Separation Control on Aerodynamic Surfaces.  The NASA Environmentally Responsible Aviation Project is seeking to determine the applicability of active separation control to commercial aircraft operation from the perspective of value, indicating that aerodynamic performance, system integration complexity, and system costs in terms of required energy are part of the decision process.  NASA has decided to use a technology known as sweeping jet active flow control actuation as the underpinning technology for the research development.	In order to successfully perform this effort, NASA requires research and engineering services  in the use of sweeping jet actuators for active separation control applications in external aerodynamics.  The Contractor shall provide services for general test planning and data analysis to be used by NASA and its partner for a full-scale vertical tail test at the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) 40-by-80-ft Wind Tunnel. NASA/LARC intends to purchase the items from the University of Arizona as the only reasonably available source in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b). The University of Arizonas long history of research in the area of Active Flow Control results in their unique capability to perform the required effort.  These research includes: (1) Supporting a Boeing/DARPA/NASA/AFRL cooperative research arrangement in 2003  2004 to apply Active Separation Control to a Boeing Tilt Wing Aircraft design; (2) Grant NNX07AB73A under which the University designed and fabricated Oscillatory Jets (now called sweeping jets). The Universitys actuator design and recommendations to modify the model yielded a 50% improvement in the efficiency of the Active Flow Control benefit; (3) The University also performed as a subcontractor under a SBIR Phase I, NNX08CC60P and Phase 2 NNX09CB20C performing Compact Fluidic Actuator Arrays for Flow Control.  This effort included fluid mechanics analysis of the actuator performance and fabrication and testing of actuators applied to aerodynamic wind tunnel models to define family traits of sweeping jet actuators applied to systems benefiting from active separation control technology.  The cited research, and particularly that performed under NRA NNX07AB73A, showed that sweeping jet actuators resulted in rapid response to accelerating flap motions.  Largely as a result of that research, the ERA Project included the AFC Enhanced Vertical Tail activity in ERA Phase 1.	Therefore, the Contracting Officer has determined that the University of Arizona is the only reasonably available source in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 15, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

The purpose of this solicitation is to provide the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD); National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) with technical support for conducting risk assessments on environmental stressors and developing stats-of-the-art methods, models, and guidance documents for human health risk assessment in three key areas of single chemical risk assessment, chemical mixture risk assessment, and microbial risk assessment.
The contractor shall provide all personnel, materials, services, and facilities to perform work as identified in the performance work statement.  The Government anticipates the award of a cost plus fixed fee, level-of-effort (LOE) type contract with a twelve month term and four twelve month options.  The base level of effort will consist of 30,000 hours.  In addition, options will be included to increase the level of effort by up to 46,380 direct labor hours during each period. 
Significant potential exists for conflicts of interest (COI) under this procurement, therefore, interested parties are advised that EPAAR provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) requiring the offeror to certify that it is unaware of any potential COI or to disclose any potential COI of which it is aware, shall be required.

The text of this clause will mirror the clause Limitation of Future Contracting, Alternate V (Headquarters Support), (EPAAR 1552.209-74), (APR 2004), except for paragraph (c). Paragraph (c) of the clause shall read as follows:
The contractor, during the life of the contract, will be ineligible to enter into a business or financial relationship with other entities to perform human health risk assessment methods and guidelines that are the same as or similar to those that have been issued through Work Assignments under this contract. Additionally, the contractor during the life of the contract, and for a period of three years from its completion agrees not to enter into contracts with entities who could be impacted (either positively or negatively) from the content of regulations or policies that result from work that the contractor (or its subcontractors) have performed under this contract, without prior written authorization from the Contracting Officer.
The solicitation is subject to full and open competition, all responsible offerors may submit a proposal.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 (All Other Professional Scientific and Technical Services) with a size standard of $14 million.

<DESC>Project work consists of maintenance dredging of the Morehead City Harbor Cutoff and Range A. The work will consist of removal and disposal of shoaled material that has accumulated in the channels since they were last dredged. The dredging may be performed by mechanical dredge (clamshell, dragline or dipper). Dredging depth is 45 feet plus 2 feet of allowable overdepth. Disposal of dredged material will be in the Nearshore Placement Area. The environmental window for disposal in the Nearshore Placement Area is 1 December to 30 April. Efforts are currently underway to obtain an extension of the environmental window beyond 30 April for disposal in the Nearshore Placement Area. If weather and/or wave conditions prohibit safe disposal in the Nearshore Placement Area, the Contractor will be allowed to place dredged material in the Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site (ODMDS). However there will be a limit on the number of loads allowed to be placed in the ODMDS. The quantity of material to be dredged, including allowable overdepth, is estimated to be approximately 500,000 cubic yards.<br /><br />Magnitude of construction is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government.

<a href="mailto:darlene.l.rideout.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (SPS)</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division in support of the Human Systems Integration and Sciences Division (RDNS-WSH) located at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, is requesting concept papers from industry and academia to develop an in-depth research strategy to determine the effects of weight and area of coverage (encapsulation) of head borne systems on aural-visual task performance. Initially, a white paper proposal will be submitted and reviewed and those that are selected will be invited to NSRDEC for a full briefing and presentation of proposals.  The desired final outcome would be the selection of a finalized research proposal for contract initiation and execution.   <br>  <br> Current research efforts within the Army are directed towards optimizing soldiers' levels of ballistic protection to allow for improved action-perception and situational awareness capabilities. Head-borne loads, including helmets, are a specific area of concern.  A soldier's ability to maintain situational awareness and effectively identify enemy targets and other threats while wearing head-borne systems translates directly to increased survivability and unit effectiveness. The purpose of this effort is to develop and execute a research strategy to determine the effects of weight and area of coverage (encapsulation) of head borne systems on threat identification using Ecological Task analysis and approaches from Dynamic Systems Theory. <br>  <br> Specifically, this effort will develop research plans to determine the following: <br> 1.	Effects of Encapsulation on Aural-Visual Task Performance <br> 2.	Effects of Moment Load and Distribution on Aural-Visual Task Performance <br> 3.	Combined Effects of Load and Encapsulation on Aural-Visual Task Performance <br>  <br> These research strategies must provide the following data: <br> 1.	Operational Task Performance - These task level metrics should be characterized in terms of the spatial-temporal changes in task performance (e.g. Time to Identify Target, % Correct Identifications, etc) under the variety of load and encapsulation parameters. These metrics provide information specific to the functional capabilities of the soldier.  <br> 2.	Coordinative Dynamics Metrics - Metrics in the coordinative dynamics are those that directly underlie performance at the task level and are helpful for understanding the changes in coordinative dynamics while wearing protective helmets. Examples include: Eye-Head-Trunk coordination and variability, Head-Helmet Relative Motion, Head -Trunk Coordination, Head/Gaze Angle - Target Coupling, Variability Analysis/Motor Abundance.  <br> 3.	Underlying Dynamics - Metrics of underlying dynamics are those more abstract analysis of the ongoing dynamics within the Organism-Environment system capable of capturing the complexity of the dynamics, stability-variability relations, specific coupling relations, or other measures deemed relevant to task performance. This analysis could include time-series analysis, fractal analysis, power law relations, and other tools within Dynamic Systems Theory capable of using variables that capture organism-environmental relations (e.g. Center of Pressure (CoP), Eye-Movement time series, etc).   <br> 4.	Aural-Visual Task Perception supporting Task performance - Helmet area of coverage impairs both aural and visual localization of potential environmental threats (information specification of the threat). When having to orient towards these threats in dynamic environments, this suggests that a greater degree of visual search may be required as aural uncertainty increases and vice-versa. A multi-modal approach is desired that captures the trade-offs and contributions of these perceptual modes (aural-visual) in target identification tasks in dynamic environments under a variety of load and area of coverage parameters.  <br>  <br> The proposed research approach must clearly identify how and why the effort will be successful including the proposed personnel, materials, and equipment required to execute the research protocols.  Approximate cost and schedule should also be provided in the concept paper. Concept development strategies without such supporting information will be weighed negatively.  Interested parties will submit a white paper proposal for evaluation.  NSRDEC will invite authors of selected white papers to an onsite briefing in May 2013 by NSRDEC. During the initial meeting, NSRDEC will present the  quote mark problem space, quote mark  including the current challenges, the problem constraints, what NSRDEC's expectations are for research undertaken to resolve the problem space, and discussion of the potential means by which the above goals may be achieved. Those parties invited to NSRDEC will then be given time to prepare a presentation on possible research strategies and capabilities to be presented to NSRDEC on an individual basis on the following day. Successful presentations to NSRDEC will result in the invitation to begin the Proposal process, which includes the ability to collaborate and discuss specific approaches with the Technical Point of Contact (POC) to optimize successful submission. Following proposal submission, no contact with the technical POC may occur as the official selection process for contract award will begin.   <br>  <br> Technical reporting shall be conducted at a minimum, on a quarterly basis and/or associated with significant technical milestones outlined in the concepts programmatic approach.  Technical reporting will require complete documentation of the research and development efforts including cost, schedule and performance updates.   <br>  <br> All efforts are subject to availability of funds. <br>  <br> All interested firms are encouraged to submit a concept paper to NSRDEC in accordance with NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Solicitation W911QY-13-R-0032, which can be found at http://www3.natick.army.mil. The BAA contains instructions for submission of Concept Papers against Topic #19 Ecological Approach to Warfighter Survivability; Perception-Action-Cognition, subtopics 2 and 4.  Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. Nothing shall be construed herein or through the synopsis process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this synopsis. Firms responding to this synopsis shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government, and will not be returned to the submitter. Interested parties are invited to submit a concept paper under the topic referenced above and shall submit via email to Gail Bernheart (gail.d.bernheart.civ@mail.mil) by 22 April 2013.  The Government shall evaluate all concept papers and provide a written response/on-site invitation to the authors on or about 03 May, 2013.  Technical questions concerning this acquisition should be addressed to Dr. Christopher Palmer, via e-mail Christopher.j.palmer18.civ@mail.mil or 508-233-5196.  Authors are highly encouraged to speak with the above POC prior to white paper submission. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that cost plus fixed fee contract will be awarded.  In accordance with FAR 16.301-3, for an anticipated cost type contract to be awarded, potential offerors must ensure that they have an adequate accounting system, as determined by their cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) office.   The Natick BAA is effective from April 1, 2013 through March 30, 2015. This synopsis expires in 30 days. <br>

<p>The U. S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), is interested in obtaining, testing, and evaluating technologies and/or materials with potential application in device-assisted, user-interpreted counterfeit deterrent features on future generations of U. S. currency. Proposed counterfeit deterrent features should be novel and not widely available in the marketplace. Proposed features may be incorporated into the banknote or applied to the note. An effective device-assisted user-interpreted feature should be extremely difficult to simulate or duplicate, but should be easy to authenticate by the public using a ubiquitous, readily available and low cost device. Examples of these devices include but are not limited to optical filters, magnifiers, low cost laser pointers, LED flashlights, magnets, and cell phones.</p>
<p>Technologies and/or materials submitted for consideration will be reviewed for inherent and relative effectiveness as a security feature, and may be further assessed for compatibility with design and production factors, durability, environmental acceptability, and other processing requirements.</p>
<p>The Bureau will only consider technologies, materials, and detection systems for which at least laboratory feasibility has already been demonstrated (i.e. concept proven, lab prototypes or samples available). For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit preliminary samples and a brief technical description to:</p>
<p>Bureau of Engraving and Printing <br />Office of Acquisitions <br />Attn: Kathleen Barton<br />14th and C Streets, S.W., <br />Washington, D.C. 20228-0001.</p>

PLEASE RESPOND TO THESE QUESTIONS UNDER THE HYPOTHETICAL ASSUMPTION THAT DOS ISSUES A SOLICITATION BASED ON THE INCLUDED PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS). SOME QUESTIONS REQUIRE YOU TO ASSUME THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION HAS RESPONDED TO THIS HYPOTHETICAL SOLICITATION AND THAT DOS HAS SELECTED YOUR ORGANIZATION FOR A CONTRACT AWARD.<br />3.

Additionally, the current process is outdated and does not effectively or efficiently mitigate the risk of improper payments. A need exists to provide INL with the ability to implement efficient management controls over extremely complex, high dollar contracts. <br />INL desires to find a COTS product that could provide the needed functionality, serve as the central repository of all invoice transaction details and perform pre-payment validation procedures. The application should be able to apply a standard set of business rules to identify transactions that do not conform to the contract, that are duplicative of prior charges, not in conformity with regulations or not properly supported. The results of these tests should be easily displayed in a series of customized and standardized reports that will allow invoice reviewers to monitor transactions more efficiently. Lastly, the application should provide needed insight in the financial performance of each program by monitoring the level of spending in relation to the level of funding.<br />Project Objectives<br />1. Automate invoice pre-payment validation processes initially for contract task orders to the maximum extent possible.<br />1.1. Scheduled data retrieval to efficiently import data from contractor provided deliverables, including but not limited to Cost Proposals, Invoices, and potentially supporting documentation. <br />1.2. Employ a menu driven interface that links users to invoice transactions allowing users to manually enter data in predefined fields to supplement data directly imported.<br />1.3. Utilize defined sampling strategies when there are large amounts of transactions and a high amount of manual effort involved in analysis.<br />1.4. Produce canned reports to include the following: <br />1) Exceptions Report that identifies transactions that do not conform to defined business rules and flags them for further analysis, <br />2) Duplicate payment report, <br />3) Burn Rate Report that monitors the pace of spending, <br />4) Cost Proposal Summary Report,<br />5) Invoice Summary Report that shows all paid invoices, <br />6) Manning Rosters generated from billed labor charges for use in the field for employee verification purposes, <br />7) Employee Report that shows all related expenses attributable to an individual employee, <br />8) Trend Exceptions (e.g. position variances in employee history, statistical quality management reports).9) Vendor Rate Comparison that will provide insight for program evaluation and planning, <br />10) Productivity Statistics on invoice reviewers, <br />2. Deliver ad-hoc reports and provide data-mining functionality in support of program analysis and audit/investigation/Congressional oversight response.<br />3. Provide contractors with support to submit data from their electronic systems based on business rules defined in each applicable contract. <br />4. Allow DOS users the ability to track refunds from the vendors. <br />5. Track charges that are formally rejected on invoices to monitor resubmission on future invoices.<br />6. "Do Not Pay" list to prevent improper payments to subcontractors.<br />7. Within the following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs), the application should be able to track transactions to these levels of detail:<br />7.1. Labor: Employee ID, Employee Name, Pay Period, Labor Rate, Nationality<br />7.2. Travel: Employee ID, Employee Name, Airline, Flight Class, Travel Dates, Price, Route/Location<br />7.3. Other Reimbursable Costs: Description, Date of Delivery, Transaction Amount, Vendor, Unit Quantity and Price, Serial Number, VIN<br />Business Requirements<br />The application must provide user-friendly tools to efficiently assist in the invoice validation process while serving the overall strategic and operational objectives of INL/RM/CAS to perform contract oversight and financial monitoring.</p>
<p>1. User Requirements<br />1.1. User interface - menu driven, data entry screens, straightforward design. <br />1.2. Accessibility - web based for users around the world.<br />1.3. Advanced data mining capabilities <br />1.4.

Business rules will be defined by INL/RM/CAS <br />1.4.2. Check for charges on a list of prohibited vendors/individuals.<br />1.5. Invoice Status Action - ability to mark invoices as rejected or approved and to track charges which were identified as improper.</p>
<p>2. System Requirements<br />2.1. Security in compliance with Department of State requirements: USB (sneakernet) to avoid cross contaminating or obtaining special permissions for each use of transferring files from development to OpenNet and vice versa <br />2.2. Hosting (Development Network): IT infrastructure provider and maintenance <br />2.2.1. SQL Server Standard Edition plus an Ad-hoc reporting tool (Power view add-in)<br />2.3.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis to determine the availability of companies capable of providing software as a service and associated program management to support online housing listings and home finding for the military for CNIC, Washington, DC.  

DoD 4165.63M, DoD Housing Management, requires that personnel shall have access to the DoD Automated Housing Referral Network (AHRN) (http://www.ahrn.com) or a list of local rental and sale properties at each location before arrival.  Each listing shall include basic information for personnel to determine unit suitability such as housing type, cost, number of bedrooms, unit size, availability, and location.  For the past 11 years, all military services and the Coast Guard (hereafter known as stakeholders) have used AHRN as the service of choice to fulfill this requirement.
 

AHRN has been deemed by DoD as a software as a service (SaaS) that stores DoD information on a non-DoD system.  It provides free access to military members and landlords/property managers to a rental and for sale by owner (FSBO) listings near each military installation.  Military members are able to manage their personal preferences and landlords/property managers are able to manage their listings.  In addition, to end user rights, the military housing offices (MHOs) have control over all of their installation data and much of the input by landlords to ensure it complies with DoD requirements for listings, inspections, and suitability criteria, and whether or not properties can be seen by military members.
  MHOs also use AHRN to communicate with military members and landlords/property managers, manage complaints and issues, and to support their annual basic allowance for housing (BAH) data collection effort.

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  The Government is not obligated and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  This is a market research tool used to determine the availability and adequacy of businesses prior to determining the method of acquisition.  With the assumption that a competitive procurement will be in the best interest of the Government, this office anticipates the award of a contract by 01 December 2013, with services to commence on 01 January 2014.
  The resultant contract will be one year in length with 2 additional twelve month options.  The appropriate NAICS Code is 541519.  The small business size classification is $25.5M.
It is requested that interested parties submit to the Contracting Office a brief capabilities statement, in addition to answering the questions included in the attached document.  It is requested that the submission be no longer than 15 pages in length (single-spaced, 12-point font minimum) demonstrating the ability to perform the requested services.  Please include a company profile to include number of employees, office location(s), DUNS number, CAGE Code, and statement regarding small business designation and status.

RESPONSES ARE DUE ON WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10TH, by 4PM (EST).
  All submissions are required to be submitted via e-mail to Mike Capilato at michael.capilato@navy.mil by the above deadline.  Please direct any questions to the same individual.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE</strong></p>
<p>THE U. S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (NRC) is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis as a means of conducting market research or as a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of the business community to provide all management, supervision, administration, and labor for the COLLECTION OF DATA ON DOSES TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC EXPOSED TO PATIENTS TREATED WITH IODINE-131: 1) Measure External Doses to Selected Members of the Public; 2) Measure Internal Doses to Selected Members of the Public; 3) Time and Motion Study; 4) Analysis of Data and Final Report; and 5) Technical Support. Services are to be provided to the NRC in Rockville, Maryland. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541712.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposal; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of conflict of interest (COI). For information on NRC COI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5 (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html). All interested parties, including all categories of small businesses (small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone small businesses) are invited to submit a response. The capabilities package submitted by a vendor should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and responsibility to perform the principal components of work listed below. The package should also include past performance/experience regarding projects of similar scope listing the project title, general description, the dollar value of the contract, and name of the company, agency, or government entity for which the work was performed. <br /><br />Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements. Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested. Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures or videos is discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND: </strong></p>
<p>Radioactive iodine, mainly the isotope Iodine-131, is used in the diagnosis and treatment of several medical conditions, the primary ones in the present context being treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer following thyroidectomy. The importance of these conditions arises from the fact that their treatment protocols generally call for administration of relatively large doses of Iodine-131, and such patients therefore pose the greatest potential for exposure of others. <br /><br />Patients are often released from the hospital following treatment if they meet the release conditions specified in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 10, Part 35.75, "Release of individuals containing unsealed byproduct material or implants containing byproduct material." The basic criterion underlying the release conditions is that "the total effective dose equivalent to any other individual from exposure to the released individual is not likely to exceed 5 mSv (0.5 rem)."</p>
<p><br /><strong>MANDATORY QUALIFYING CRITERIA: </strong></p>
<p>The contractor shall have established an "institutional review board" Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 50, which is a panel of experts that approves clinical trials and is required by the federal regulations.</p>
<p><br /><strong>MARKET RESEARCH QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p><br />If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number.</p>
<p>2) What size is your organization with respect to NAICS code 541712 (i.e. "small" or "other than small")? If your organization is a small business under the aforementioned NAICS code, what type of small business (i.e. small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, 8(a), or HUBZone small business? Specify all that apply.</p>
<p>3) Although no geographic restriction is anticipated, if responding organizations are located outside the Washington Metropolitan area (Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia), indicate how the organization would coordinate with the NRC program office located in Rockville, Maryland to provide the support services.</p>
<p>4) Does your organization have experience providing dose measurements and analysis on human subjects? If so, please list and describe those contracts (contract number, contract type, contract value, description of supplies and services included in the scope, period of performance, etc.) and indicate your organization's role (prime contractor, first tier subcontractor, and/or supplier).</p>
<p>5) Indicate whether your organization provides any radiological research on existing Federal Government contracts (i.e., GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts or Government-wide Acquisition Contracts) that the NRC could order from, providing the contract number(s) and indicate what is currently available for ordering from each contract.</p>
<p>6) Has your company worked for any of the licensee's regulated (http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/) by the NRC in the past year?</p>
<p>7) Has your company previously brought to the NRC any potential organizational conflict of interest issues with NRC? If so, how were they resolved?</p>
<p>Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Synopsis are encouraged to structure capability statements in the order of the area of consideration noted above. All capability statements sent in response to this notice must be submitted electronically, via e-mail, to Claudia Melgar, at Claudia.Melgar@nrc.gov, in either Microsoft Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), within&nbsp;eighteen (18) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice. This market survey is being conducted through the FedBizOpps to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: <br /></strong>No current incumbent contractor.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER AND NOTES:</strong> Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's potential capability and capacity to perform the subject work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>

<DESC>The Alaska District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) on the FY14 design-build Warm Storage Hangar at Fort Wainwright, Alaska (FTW373A). A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects; (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with the law. (Reference: FAR Provision 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement and FAR Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement)<br /><br />In order to assist in the evaluation as to whether the use of a PLA is appropriate for the FTW373A Warm Storage Hangar, the Alaska District is soliciting information on historical use of PLAs in the Fairbanks area. Any interested party (contractors, project owners, contractor associations, labor unions, construction management firms, etc.) may respond. LETTERS SIMPLY INDICATING SUPPORT FOR OR OPPOSITION TO LABOR UNIONS AND/OR PLAs DO NOT OFFER ANY USEFUL INFORMATION AND WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. Please provide responses to any or all of the following questions:<br />&nbsp;<br />(1) What market share does union labor have in the Fairbanks geographical area?<br />(2) Are any Collective Bargaining Agreements expected to expire between March 2014 and December 2015?<br />(3) Could a PLA contribute to cost savings on the FTW373A project? How?<br />(4) Could a PLA minimize risk to the Government on the FTW373A project? How?<br />(5) Are there ways a PLA would increase costs on the FTW373A project? How?<br />(6) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor in the Fairbanks labor market?<br />(7) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br />(8) Have PLAs been used on private sector construction projects in the Fairbanks geographical area? If so, please provide the following details:<br /><br />&nbsp; A. Project Name and Location<br />&nbsp; B. Project Description<br />&nbsp; C. Project Cost<br />&nbsp; D. Was the project completed on time?<br />&nbsp; E. Number of craft trades present on the project.<br />&nbsp; F. Were there any challenges experienced during the project (delays, investigations, safety issues, labor shortages, management/organizational issues, etc)?<br /><br />Please limit your responses to no more than two (2) pages in length. Provide your responses via email to Donna West, Contracting Officer at Donna.L.West@usace.army.mil no later than April 30, 2013.<br />

2.	Program Information
2.1.	Points of Contact 
Ricky Stephens - Project Manager VA, Office of Information Technology (OIT), Phone: 941-531-4637, Email: Ricky.Stephens@va.gov

Contract Specialist- Peter Lewandowski, VA Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), Phone: 732-440-9640, Email: peter.lewandowski@va.gov
2.2.	Initiative or Division
DEAP supports Executive Order 13426 (March 6, 2007): Establishing a commission on care for America's returning wounded warriors and a task force on returning global war on terror heroes.  
The task force report recommends data-exchange enhancements to enhance the overall quality and efficiency of Veteran health care.
DEAP also directly supports the Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 and The Veterans Employment Initiative (VEI.)
It is a Health Product Division, Health Product Administrative Enhancement.
3.	Disability Exam and Assessment Program (DEAP) Background 
Currently 3.5 million Veterans receive military service-related compensation benefits through the United States (US) VA.  8.6 million people are enrolled in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  The number of eligible Veterans is increasing significantly and rapidly as the nation winds down its decade-long war effort and greater numbers of Service Member's (SM) transition to Veteran status.  
VA currently faces a backlog of nearly one million claims and must transform its ability to process these claims in order to successfully provide Veterans with the benefits they have earned.  The need for a standardized, automated separation exam to document health status will support VA's need for medical evidence now and in the future.
The electronic sharing of health, administrative, and personnel information for disability claims processing is essential to the VA's transformation.  This capability, which was encompassed by Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Capability Area 2 (VCA-2), is related to multiple VA programs that require the ability to share different types of information in order to administer disability benefits, including: Compensation and Pension Records Interchange (CAPRI), Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS), and Virtual VA.  
These also require the use of VLER Data Access Service (DAS), Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE), and the Health Data Repository (HDR) to function fully.  VA and the Department of Defense (DoD) are also currently constructing the massive integrated electronic health record (iEHR).  
Once implemented, disability evaluators will utilize VBMS and the iEHR to adjudicate claims.  In the meantime, in order to meet demands and serve our Veterans well, a strategy to bridge current VA and DoD information technology (IT) gaps must be developed and must interface current legacy systems.
4.	DEAP Goals
DEAP goals are to develop and manage a Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) exam request integrated into a clinical system enabling scheduling, tracking and performance of comprehensive, timely, and quality patient medical evaluations in support of disability determination and VA adjudication processes.  
Once developed and tested, DEAP will provide real-time access to a comprehensive clinical system that greatly assists fulfillment of VBA exam requests by both VA and non-VA clinicians. 
The system will support a highly customizable clinical protocol based examination tailored to each Veteran's / SM claimed disability conditions capable of using information from electronic health records (VA, Contractors and DoD)
The system will manage the exam request and systematically collect administrative and clinical data and automatically submit focused patient information to the assigned adjudicator(s) and to other users, to include DoD. 
This streamlined disability claims processing will expedite current claims, immediately reducing the overwhelming backlog of Veteran claims awaiting adjudication, using VA resources efficiently. 
This centralized clinical infrastructure provides controls for implementing cost-effective workload management strategies and adds considerable flexibility in supporting future changes based on VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.
5.	Statement of the Problems
Specific problems are as follows:
"	There is currently a lack of a web-based, centralized, automated, clinical exam workflow and exam request management system. There is a need to upgrade the current system that directly supports fulfillment of VBA disability exam and medical opinion requests to disability evaluation providers. The need includes a standardized way to complete pre- and post-separation medical assessments and disability examinations that interface seamlessly with legacy systems, i.e., CAPRI, VBMS, and Virtual VA, VISTA, Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).
"	There is currently a lack of real-time access via a system, that can guide VHA, DoD, and contracted, external clinicians through the management of the VBA exam request and along with a highly customizable guided clinical protocol (and graphical user interface (GUI)) that uses the Veteran's/SM's claimed conditions and available patient medical information to auto populate or provide the foundation of a customized disability exam protocol.
"	There is currently no method to automatically submit pertinent computable medical information (data) to the VBA adjudicator.
"	There is currently no flexible infrastructure that can adequately support future planned changes based on VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD).
"	There is no method to support the accessibility of VA contracted exams and medical information by VHA or DoD clinicians. 
6.	DEAP Business Needs
The following are the primary DEAP business needs (BN).
"	BN1 - Adhere to the Enterprise Level requirements within the Enterprise Requirements Management (ERM) Repository.
"	BN2 - Supported agencies shall have the ability to electronically submit requests for medical evaluation.
"	BN3 - VHA and VBA users shall have the ability to electronically create a request for medical evaluation from within their respective workflows/processes.
"	BN4 - Compensation and Pension (C&P) clinic users shall have the ability to obtain triage services (i.e., review and prioritization setting) on requests for exam. 
"	BN5 - C&P clinic users shall have the ability to obtain system-assisted scheduling services on triaged requests for medical evaluation.
"	BN6 - System users shall have access to a role-based, centralized system to appropriately resolve requests for medical evaluation supporting a Veteran's or SM's claim with supported agencies.
"	BN7 - Provide C&P clinician with enhanced system-assisted usability when documenting and working with the requests for exams.
"	BN8 - Provide the ability for users to monitor work performed.
"	BN9 - Provide the ability for C&P users to send/receive electronic communications directly from within the system.
"	BN10 - Provide the ability to view all available Veteran/SM medical and other related records needed to perform an exam.
"	BN11 - Provide the ability for VBA end users to perform necessary actions within an electronic paperless Disability Benefit Questionnaires (DBQ) process.
"	BN12 - Provide role-based reporting services to all C&P users/management as appropriate to their user role.
"	BN13 - System users shall have the ability to utilize up-to-date medical evaluation templates.
"	BN14 - Provide the ability for C&P clinic users to refer exams to contracted vendors from within the system.
"	BN15 - Provide the ability for C&P clinic users to confirm the receipt of a medical evaluation returned from the vendors.
"	BN16 - Provide the ability for C&P users to track and monitor all referrals of contracted exams.
7.	Program Requirements and Needs
The scope of this RFI is to seek out if there are commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) products that could meet some or all of the business needs of an automated tool that addresses the claims benefits disability examination process with support for continued enhancements to the application, as determined and approved by the Government.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">Battery - Supply Chain Management Initiative.</p>
</span></strong>This Defense Logistics Agency's (DLA) initiative is in support of various battery classes/chemistries. This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 12.201(e). The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations on cost effective strategies to maintain a high level of material availability for various battery types/chemistries. This information will be used to construct a solicitation/contract statement of work or requirements. DLA's overall spend for batteries in FY12 was $192 Million. The Government is contemplating contracting with a supply integrator who would be responsible for some, or, all supply chain management functions to include; forecasting, warehousing, distribution, procurement, etc. The types/chemistries of batteries being targeted by this initiative include each, or all of the following battery classes/chemistries: 1) Lead Acid, 2) Lithium, 3) Alkaline/Other. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The purpose of this RFI is to: 1) determine suitability of the commercial marketplace to provide cost effective and timely support to DLA's military customers; 2) assess current industry experience and capabilities in regards to battery types/chemistries; and 3) support the possibility of a full and open competition requirement. DLA Land and Maritime intends to use information resulting from the RFI responses to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budgeting assumptions, and performance specifications to be included in the RFP. <br /><strong>Objectives:</strong> DLA Land and Maritime is pursuing a contract(s) that will provide for cost effective and timely support for its military customers from the commercial sector for some or all the above mentioned battery classes/chemistries. The overarching objective is to adopt best business processes in support of batteries to reduce cost without degrading current system readiness and reliability. The Government contemplates possibly issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 12 that may result in a fixed price contract lasting 5 years (3 year base with 2 one year options). Estimated award date is December 2013. Based on the results of a business case analysis and best value analysis, DLA Land and Maritime, may elect to solicit/award all battery types/classes to a single vendor or make multiple awards by individual battery classes/chemistries. <br /><strong>Responses:</strong> Written response to this RFI shall be limited to 15 pages, single space. If material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned). Response should include, but is not limited to the following: (A) Company History: A one page history to include; Small Business Administration (SBA) size classification; major products; and primary customer base. Additionally, RFI responders should provide examples of past experience that would warrant the Government's consideration of the company as its Supply Chain Provider for some or all battery classes/chemistries. (B) Supply Chain Management and Logistics: Describe "value proposition" of shifting customer support for specific battery classes/chemistries from DLA to the commercial sector - Include how existing commercial infrastructure and best practices will contribute to cost savings to DOD and maximize material availability for batteries which have a high criticality to the Warfighter. (C) Support/Additional Technical/Quality Information: Provide information on how your firm manages battery obsolescence and shelf life. (D) Cost: Vendor should provide a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) for their proposal in meeting the anticipated performance requirements. <br /><strong>Submission Information:</strong> RFI responses shall be submitted no later than 29 April 2013 to DLA Land and Maritime, Attn: SAPD / Ms Julie Miller, 3990 East Broad St., Columbus OH 43218-3990. Electronic responses are preferred and should be submitted to julie.miller@dla.mil. <br /><strong>Additional Information:</strong> There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by industry responses to this RFI. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunities website located at http://www.fbo.gov/. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with IBM Corporation, located at 6710 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD  20817, for the purchase of their Accelerated Value Program for Rational and WebSphere software.  This procurement is being made in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or supplies or services will satisify the agency?s requirements.?
The Accelerated Value Program goes significantly beyond standard maintenance through dedicated access to IBM Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).  These SMEs are available to the customer to assist with issues and problems both remotely and in person and support the initial implementation and follow on support of the Rational and WebSphere products.  Due to the level of advice being provided by the SME?s, they will not only need to have access to the source code and IBM-specific technical knowledge, but will need to be able to directly access and coordinate within IBM?s support organization.  IBM Rational and WebSphere tools are proprietary software licensed to SSA by IBM.   
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  This posting constitutes SSA?s notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis as described above. SSA does not intend to pay for any information received as a result of this notice.  Interested parties that feel they can provide the services described above may respond by submitting their capability statement by email to brenda.monch@ssa.gov by 12:00 noon EST on April 4, 2013.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations.  Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

<ARCHDATE>05312013
<CONTACT>Jason L. Albright, Email eflhd.contracts@dot.gov - Shirley A Anderson, Contract Specialist, Email EFHLD.contracts@dot.gov
<DESC>Background:
<p>A constant challenge is faced when addressing roadside safety issues to meet maintenance requirements when roads are repaved, and also for a changing fleet of vehicles. It has been shown through simulation and confirmed by crash testing under National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) 350 TL 3 that barriers below the nominal top-of-rail heights increase the propensity for the 2000p vehicle to vault the barrier [1,2]. Consequently, there has been considerable effort to make agencies aware of the need to maintain barrier heights to avoid potential vaulting problems and to develop modifications for barriers to cost effectively increase their height. Under the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH) Test Level 2 (TL2), barriers have the same crash test requirements except that a lower impact speed is used. Research has not, however, considered guardrail height needs for TL 2 criteria for NCHRP 350 nor the new MASH criteria. Agencies need to understand the risks, if any, of allowing barriers to exist at lower heights and be able to evaluate options to strategically remedy possible problems. The question of whether to raise a guardrail or not comes up on many occasions during pavement construction projects. Guidelines have been developed for high-speed (TL-3) facilities to address when barriers should be raised. With fiscal constraints on all agencies, it is desirable to know if it would be satisfactory for a strong-post W-beam barrier to remain in place at a lower than standard height in a TL-2 type of condition (45 mph).</p>
<p>Computerized crash simulation has been used many times over the past 20+ years to design and/or evaluate w-beam guardrail systems. The FHWA study cited earlier is an excellent example of such and effort. Models have become more detailed and subsequent analyses have demonstrated that barrier design details can be effectively replicated (e.g., the crash performance of raising block-outs up to 3 inches [3]. Other guardrail performance conditions have also been evaluated [4 -12]. Thus, the use of models and simulation can be expected to provide viable results for evaluating the heights of barriers for TL-2 conditions.</p>
<p>A simulation approach is also viable for analyzing changes for factors that can vary in the field relative to the actual conditions of the barrier or the nature of the impact conditions. Since validated models exist for the small car (1100kg) and pick-up truck (2270kg) issues of both snagging and vaulting can both be evaluated under MASH criteria. It is also expected that the simulations will be able to address differences in vehicle-to-barrier interfaces that will occur for varying degrees of shoulder slope or drop-off and lateral placement of the barrier.</p>
<p>Therefore there is a need for acceptable TL-2 safety limits for the minimum heights of W-Beam Strong Post Guardrails on lower-speed, lower-volume roadways. This can easily be done by first performing computer simulations and then physically crash testing the most promising configuration for verification.</p>
<p>Although most construction projects installing barrier would specify standard height strong-post W-beam at the standard height, the primary question we need to answer is "At what height can a strong-post W-beam remain in place in a TL-2 condition when we are repaving a roadway?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to determine the minimum guardrail height for W-Beam Strong Post barrier that meets safety performance criteria set forth under MASH Test Level 2 conditions.</p>

<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), is soliciting quotes for services to sequence mRNA samples using an Illumina HiSeq200 platform.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW)</p>
<p>The FDA/NCTR require services to sequence mRNA samples using an Illumina HiSeq200 platform for the Government's "Study of Translational Biomarkers for Drug-Induced Liver Injury with Next-Generation Sequencing" to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and processes modulated by mRNAs and their importance in DILI risk and phenotypes. The resulting mRNA-Seq data will be utilized to evaluate the impact of different drugs on genetics and epigenetic in rats. The data will also be utilized to identify biomarkers for safety and prognosis, and to develop NGS bioinformatics strategies and evaluate their advantages and limitations. It is anticipated that the new discovered mRNA, may be potential novel biomarkers, will be utilized to be more predictive for human specific DILI than conventional biomarkers, such as enzymes evaluation (to date, serum-based enzymes evaluation is the common practice in DILI research).</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Background Information<br /><br />On September 27, 2007, the FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA) was signed into law and this law specifies the creation of a Unique Device Identification System.<br />The FDA's Unique Device Identification Database system will be composed of millions of medical device records. These records will be available for the general public to search against and require a high-performance search engine that can handle the volume of requests as well as return the results to meet performance requirements. <br />The FDA is currently implementing the Unique Device Identification Database (UDID). The database requires a high-performance search tool to provide satisfactory response to the queries from the medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers, and the public users.</p>
<p>Current Environment</p>
<p>The FDA has integrated the open-source Lucene/Apache Solr software. The FDA has implemented the required infrastructure (hardware, storage, network, etc.) for the Apache Server for Lucene/Solr software, built a database index, and created an extensive user interface to search records in the UDID database. The user interface addresses multiple audiences which include medical device manufacturers, labelers, healthcare providers, and the public. <br />The proposed solution shall be compatible with the above mentioned software. If vendor is proposing an alternative solution to the LucidWorks, brand name or equal to product, vendor shall be responsible for getting the FDA to a level of work that is equal to the current environment with no additional design changes, programming, cost or delays.Scope<br />The FDA requires a highly scalable software, brand name or equal to the Lucid Works product and services. If an alternative solution is proposed, vendor shall ensure the product meets all of the following salient functional characteristics -</p>
<p>1. Vendor shall provide the Lucid Works, brand name or equal to software for the UDID team at FDA.</p>
<p>2. Solution shall be compatible with the already integrated open-source Lucene/Apache Solr software.</p>
<p>3. The proposed software/solution shall entail no modification to existing FDA's software solutions that were designed/built to use LucidWorks software and hence no additional programming and/or cost to FDA.</p>
<p>4. Solution shall be a highly scalable search engine, providing distributed search and index replication.</p>
<p>5. Product shall provide Out-Of-Box Support for: Full-Text search, Hit Highlighting, Faceted Search, Dynamic Clustering, Database Integration, Rich Document (e.g. Word, PDF, etc.) Handling, Fuzzy, Soundex, Misspelled, Boolean Searches.</p>
<p>6. Product shall have the capabilities for RESTful HTTP/XML Web Services and JSON APIs for easy integration into applications.</p>
<p>7. Solution shall have the capabilities for external configuration and extensive plug-in architecture for advanced customization.</p>
<p>8. Solution shall have a variety of connector support for: Database, Sharepoint, Hadoop, XML, Web, File System, and Google Connector.<br /><br />9. Product shall have built - in monitoring tools of search usage. See how many users are using UDID system and what is searched most.</p>
<p>10. Product shall be able to be configured in a "solr cloud" configuration to provide FDA with redundancy of the search index and the speed to support 500+ concurrent users.<br /><br />11. Vendor shall provide an annual subscription for the Lucid Works software, brand name or equal to, and customer support. Customer support shall be available via telephone or email from 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday thru Friday, excluding Federal holidays, to address FDA questions and fix software errors.</p>
<p>12. Vendor shall provide fixes to the bugs identified by FDA in the Lucene/Solr software promptly within 1 to 3 business days.</p>
<p>13. Vendor shall provide consulting support in the use of the software for efficient design of the application (the estimated amount of consulting hours required annually is 40 hours).</p>
<p>14. Vendor shall provide the FDA with a solution that has the ability to expand to other applications.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a solution that meets the above salient functional characteristics the vendor shall also provide pricing for additional consulting services. Vendor shall provide an hourly rate for the consulting services that the FDA can use to purchase additional hours of service if needed (CLIN 0006). Estimate of consulting services is forty (40) hours annually. Additionally, the FDA may expand the use of the LucidWorks, brand name or equal to product to other applications. Therefore, the vendor shall provide pricing related to any expansion (i.e. additional servers, etc.) (CLIN 0006). The additional consulting hours and any costs related to expansion shall be separately priced line items in the vendor's proposal.</p>
<p>The result of this procurement will be an improved overall design of the UDID system allowing for fast response times to FDA, industry, and public user inquiries. Additionally, it should allow for fast turn-around for correcting software bugs identified by the FDA.</p>
<p>508 Applicability</p>
<p>This requirement is subject to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C 794d), as amended by P.L. Section 508 Compliance.

<p>Statement of Work (SOW)</p>
<p>DNA-Sequencing Service to assess the impact of coverage on accuracy of genotypes determined by DNA-Sequencing and to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of DNA-Sequencing technology. The current project SEQC already systematically assesses repeatability and reproducibility of RNA-seq using Illumina platform. The requested needs is to further the studied result to DNA-seq, thus, it is critical to using the same sequencing platform-Illumina. Whole Genome Sequencing (Human), 60X Coverage, from short-insert paired end reads with read length 100 bases. Package includes consensus sequence from ELAND alignment and called SNPs. This is built using short insert paired end reads only, with at least 60X average sequence coverage. Three libraries will be created for one sample. The government will send de-identified DNA samples that will be obtained from HapMap consortium for the vendor to make libraries, perform sequencing and provide encrypted raw data.</p>
<p>A. The resulting data will be utilized to:<br />(1) Enhance the understanding of the reliability of DNA-Seq technology in implementing personalized medicine</p>
<p>(2) Assess the advantages and limitations of DNA-Seq in identifying genetic biomarkers for drug safety and patient prognosis</p>
<p>(3) Develop bioinformatics algorithms and tools for analyzing DNA-Seq data</p>
<p>B. Sequence genomic DNA for 9 libraries generated from 3 HapMap sample (triplicate for each sample). The objectives for this project are:<br />(1) to assess repeatability and reproducibility of DNA-seq<br />(2) to evaluate accuracy of SNP calling from DNA-seq data<br />(3) assess usefulness of previous GWAS findings through comparison DNA-seq and SNP arrays</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. <br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-60
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 711510 with a small business size standard of $7M. This acquisition is set aside for small business and will be awarded as a Firm Fixed Price service contract.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />Project Title: Technical Writer/Editor, Smart Grid Program</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF TASK</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Smart Grid is a key component of the Obama Administration's energy plan and its strategy for U.S. innovation. By integrating digital computing and communication technologies and services with the power-delivery infrastructure, the Smart Grid will enable bidirectional flows of energy and two-way communication and control capabilities. A range of new applications and capabilities will result. Anticipated benefits range from real-time consumer control over energy usage to significantly increased reliance on solar and other sources of clean renewable energy to greatly improve reliability, flexibility and efficiency of the entire grid.</p>
<p>The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) set development of the Smart Grid as a national policy goal, and it assigned the National Institute of Standards and Technology the "primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of Smart Grid devices and systems ..."</p>
<p>To date NIST has issued the first release of a Smart Grid interoperability framework and roadmap for its further development. It has also launched a Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) to assist NIST in carrying out its EISA-assigned responsibility, including working with regulatory bodies on evaluating and implementing standards in this and subsequent releases of the NIST interoperability framework.</p>
<p>A public-private partnership, the SGIP is designed to provide "a more permanent process" to support the evolution of the interoperability framework and further development of standards, according to the report. With NIST, the report explains, the panel will "identify and address additional gaps, assess changes in technology and associated requirements for standards, and provide ongoing coordination" of standards organizations' efforts to support timely availability of needed Smart Grid standards.</p>
<p>Nearly 700 organizations have joined the SGIP. Over 1,742 individuals from membership organizations have signed up to participate in the panel's technical activities.<br />Engaging, timely communications with stakeholders for the NIST Smart Grid program is an essential necessary element for the program to achieve its goals. These stakeholders are extremely diverse and include President Obama, the Secretary of Energy and other senior-level federal officials; state and local electrical power regulators and companies; elected officials; electronic and IT equipment manufacturers; and consumers.</p>
<p>To ensure that stakeholders are fully informed about the very wide range of activities affecting development of standards and deployment of Smart Grid infrastructure components, the NIST Smart Grid program requires professional communications services from a contractor with demonstrated technical knowledge of the fields of physical science (especially energy research), electronics, and information technology, as well as proven ability to translate complex technical materials into engaging Web sites, reports, and other communications products intended for a broad public audience.</p>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS<br />The Contractor shall have at least five (5) years of experience in journalist writing and editing. It is desirable for the Contractor to be familiar with technical details of the Smart Grid program and/or the energy, physics, electronics, computer science disciplines. The Contractor must be able to work with multiple stakeholders and to prioritize workload to meet frequent deadlines.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide full-time communications services, both written documents (to be submitted electronically) and advice for managers. The Contractor must be able to attend meetings and read research results which describe the physical sciences, engineering, physics, electronics, energy, computer science, or information technology, and to gather information in the above disciplines and to synthesize them into other written materials. The Contractor shall produce text and accompanying graphics for the Smart Grid Program Website, reports, fact sheets, announcements, newsletter articles, and other written and/or multimedia materials describing the Smart Grid Program and related activities.<br />The Contractor must produce all written materials in clear, readable, engaging, and understandable Standard English in a journalistic style appropriate for an audience of college educated laypersons.</p>
<p>All property, data and information provided by the Government in the performance of this task remains the property of the Government and shall be surrendered to the government upon completion or termination of this requirement. Likewise, all deliverables generated under this requirement remain the property of the Government. All written material produced under this contract become the property of the U.S. Government and as such will be in the public domain.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to attend weekly meetings at NIST headquarters in Gaithersburg, MD, and to travel to selected meetings of the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel, which will be held in the United States, but may be on the West Coast, Mid-West, or East Coast. NIST expects that this will be between 3-5 meetings per year. <br />The Contractor must perform the requirements of this Statement of Work, and in doing so must provide, for example, their own office supplies, phone service, writing software, and other support equipment or tools.<br />The Contractor shall not respond to any media inquiries. The Contractor shall immediately relay any/all inquiries from the media to the Technical Information Contact and/or Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall not grant or give interviews, comments, or any other response without the knowledge and approval of the NIST Director of Public Affairs.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC TASKS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>1. Develop text and accompanying relevant graphics describing NIST's Smart Grid Program activities for publication on the NIST Website;</p>

<p>As part of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment for the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, NOAA will work with Trustees to perform three live capture release health assessments of bottlenose dolphins in 2013. The previous health assessments performed in Barataria Bay, LA and Sarasota Bay, FL in 2011 showed that the dolphins in Barataria Bay had significant abnormal health conditions as compared to Sarasota Bay dolphins. As part of the assessment of these dolphins, diagnostic ultrasound was used to examine the lungs, liver, kidney, reproductive tract, and heart of the animals. The diagnostic ultrasound was performed by Dr. Cynthia Smith of the National Marine Mammal Foundation. Important ultrasound findings included significant pneumonias and lung disease in some animals. Studies in 2013 will expand the dolphin health assessments to Mississippi Sound (MS and AL) as well as repeating assessments in Barataria Bay and Sarasota Bay. The purchase of the Sonosite Edge machine is critical to the ability of this study to fully assess the health of the sampled dolphins in all three sites in a comparable manner with a field durable machine.</p>
<p>This product is the only ultrasound system that meets all of the listed physical requirements and has the needed features for adequately penetrating and imaging large bottlenose dolphins. This product is the only one found that provides field durability that can withstand a 3-ft drop test which is critical for use on a boat at sea, where sea states and weather conditions can be rough. In addition, the unit's water-resistant feature is also essential for operating in a harsh, open, seawater environment. Furthermore, the unit's ability to withstand extreme temperatures and high humidity are important for functioning in the Gulf of Mexico in the summer, where temperatures can reach &gt;100F.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)<br />DATED: JANUARY 15, 2013</p>
<p>1.0	GENERAL.<br />1.1 SCOPE.  <br />The Government has a requirement for an MTU 8V4000M"XX" engine and support stand.  Engine series to be the closest to in configuration to the MTU20V4000M93L being used as the main propulsion diesels on the USCG FRCs.  The engine must have the optional automatic oil filter and common rail fuel system. In preparation to meet the training requirements for the new USCG Fast Response Cutter (FRC), the United States Coast Guard (USCG) desires to purchase an MTU 8V4000M"XX" engine and support stand for static use.  The Static MTU Engine dramatically reduces the overall length of the course by allowing students to perform the mechanical maintenance requirements on the engine without the necessity of removing any interference's or electrical components or wiring.  The initial cost of the procurement of this static engine is offset by the elimination of the mid-cycle replacement cost of procuring a renewal operating MTU 20 V4000M93L Diesel Engine for our Lab at the 10-year mark.  With the students performing all repairs and maintenance procedures on the static engine, the expected life of our operational engine would be extended indefinitely.  The engine will be used in the training program that directly supports maintenance and operations of the installed MDEs installed aboard Coast Guard WPC class of cutters. The engine and support stand shall be delivered to USCG Training Center (TRACEN) Yorktown, VA.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND.  <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is a military, multi-mission, maritime service within the Department of Homeland Security and one of the nation's five armed services.  Its core roles are to protect the public, the environment, and U.S. economic and security interests in any maritime region in which those interests may be at risk, including international waters and America's coasts, ports, and inland waterways.</p>
<p>The USCG has made a conscious effort within the last few years to determine the most appropriate, cost effective solutions to workforce performance problems, while simultaneously optimizing the current training infrastructure to meet operational and logistical demands. The USCG currently relies heavily on contracted training for the maintenance, operation, and troubleshooting of MTU propulsion machinery and electronic controls on the WPC class cutter. The USCG training program management office (FC-Tms) has worked to garner the resources necessary to lessen the reliance on contracted training. The USCG has determined that TRACEN Yorktown's engineering and Weapons (T-ew) facility will be the future site to train operators and maintainers of this equipment.  A significant T-ew facilities renovation is currently underway and will include the construction of a new building intended to house the WPC/FRC training aids, laboratories, and classrooms to create the USCG Training Center Yorktown, Engineering Systems School.  This engine and stand procured by this task order shall be stored at the USCG Training Center Yorktown, Engineering Systems School.</p>
<p>1.3 SECURITY.  <br />Contractor access to classified information is not currently required under this task order.</p>
<p>1.4 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.  <br />The period of performance for this Purchase Order will be 12 months ARO.</p>
<p>1.5 DELIVERY.  <br />The primary place of performance shall be at USCG TRACEN Yorktown, VA for the delivery of an engine dynamometer and associated equipment.</p>
<p>1.6 KICK-OFF MEETING.  <br />The Contractor shall attend a Kick-Off Meeting with the Contracting Officer and the COR not later than five (5) business days after the date of award.  The purpose of the Kick-Off Meeting, which will be chaired by the Contracting Officer, is to discuss technical and contracting objectives of this task order and review the Contractor's Project Plan.  The Kick-Off Meeting will be held at the Government's facility or remotely by virtual conferencing tools (i.e., teleconference, online meetings).</p>
<p>1.7 PROJECT PLAN.  <br />The Contractor shall provide a draft Project Plan at the Kick-Off Meeting for Government review and comment.  The Project Plan shall include tentative dates for delivery of auxiliary support equipment during the Period of Performance to include any equipment options executed by the Government. The Contractor shall provide a final Project Plan to the COTR not later than five (5) business days after the Kick-Off Meeting.</p>
<p>1.8 STATUS REPORTS.  <br />The Project Manager shall provide a status report to the Contracting Officer and COR the last working day of each month.  This report shall include a summary of all Contractor work performed, an assessment of technical progress, schedule status, and any Contractor concerns or recommendations.</p>
<p>1.9 STATUS MEETINGS.  <br />The Project Manager shall be responsible for keeping the Contracting Officer and COR informed about Contractor status throughout the performance period and ensure Contractor activities are aligned with USCG objectives.</p>
<p>1.10 GENERAL REPORT REQUIREMENTS.  <br />The Contractor shall provide all written reports in electronic format with read/write capability using applications that are compatible with Coast Guard Standard Workstation (Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Office Applications).</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200056 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-66.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft.  THE SCHEDULE OF LINE ITEMS IS ON A SEPARATE ATTACHMENT.  










It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded to American Eurocopter Corporation on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or OEM authorized distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that American Eurocopter Corporation is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  

Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent EASA Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  

Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 

The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (FEB 2012) with the following included by Addendum:

Cost or Pricing Data
It is DHS policy that pricing for competitive negotiations should be based on adequate price competition.  However, in the event only one responsible offeror is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that offeror may be required to submit either Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-4) or Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-3) to support price negotiations.





Evaluation  Commercial Items 
Quotes will be evaluated and purchase order issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable. 
Technically Acceptable:  Quotes must be for new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent EASA Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.

(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200057 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-66.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft.  THE SCHEDULE OF LINE ITEMS IS ON A SEPARATE ATTACHMENT.  










It is anticipated that a non-competitive order shall be awarded to Breeze Eastern on a sole source basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Breeze Eastern. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or OEM authorized distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that Breeze Eastern is the only source able to obtain the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  

Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew.  The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent EASA Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  

Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number. Labeling data shall be attached to the outside of the shipping container. Bar coding is not required. 

The following FAR provisions/clauses are included and incorporated by reference:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.


(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
 (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>SECTION C - DESCRIPTION / SPECIFICATIONS / STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK<br />FOR<br />MILLING MACHINES AND TRAINING</p>
<p><br />C.1 INTRODUCTION <br />This requirement is for two vertical milling machines and associated training for the 22nd Maintenance Battalion, General Support Company, Support Plt, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. The milling machines are required to repair the transmissions of Amphibious Assault Vehicles (AAV).</p>
<p>C.2 BACKGROUND <br />The Support Platoon is responsible to repair the AAV transmissions. The machine shop can repair the transmissions, in most cases, with the proper machine tools and software. The vertical milling machine is required to perform the complex machining repairs on the AAV transmissions. Such repairs cannot be completed in a convenient fashion without the Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software. For the individual Marine to write the code required to perform the manufacture/repair of several different types of repair parts would take weeks. The CAM software will increase productivity by allowing the Marine machinist to set up and program the milling machine within a day.</p>
<p>C.3 SCOPE OF WORK <br />The increased capability that the milling machine would bring will provide the Marine machinist in the Intermediate Maintenance Activity the tools needed to maintain the advanced vehicle and weapon platforms the Marine Corps is moving towards. As the technological advancements in weapons, armor and transportation assets continues to keep our fighting forces on the cutting edge, so too must our Machinists have the ability to program complex parts and maintain the tolerance required to produce, repair and fabricate the parts needed by the war fighters.</p>
<p>C.4. CONTRACTOR SPECIFICATONS</p>

<p><br />PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters.<br />As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision:<br />Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)<br />(a)<br />(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --<br />(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and<br />(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the <br />Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

Submitted proposals must reflect Technical, Past Performance, and Price as described in Section M. It is solely the Contractor's responsibility to ensure proposals are received within the required timeframe.</p>
<p><br />SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p><br />M.1 BASIS FOR AWARD. The Government intends to make award to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror that possesses a relevant, satisfactory performance record. In accordance with FAR Part 12.206 Past Performance will be evaluated. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror when the offeror's past performance record demonstrates anything other than satisfactory performance.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and select an offer based on the initial evaluation of proposals received in response to the solicitation. Therefore, offerors are cautioned that their initial proposals should contain their best terms from a technical and price standpoint.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.212-2, the evaluation criteria that will be used for/applied to all proposals received in response to this solicitation are: (1) Technical Capability, (2) Past Performance, and (3) Price.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, will be considered by the agency. All timely proposals will be evaluated and an award will be made without discussion with vendors, unless discussions are determined to be necessary.</p>
<p>M.1.1 FACTOR #1 - TECHNICAL. A mere statement that the vendor will meet the Government requirement is NOT sufficient. The proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror possesses the capability required to successfully perform the requirements of the solicitation. Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using non-cost/price factors. Technical capability will be evaluated on contract requirements listed in Sections B and C of this solicitation (See Section L for instructions to offerors ).</p>
<p>Offers will be evaluated first on price. The lowest price offer will be evaluated for technical acceptability and satisfactory past performance. When an offer is determined to technically acceptable with satisfactory past performance, no further evaluations will be conducted and award will be made to that offeror.</p>
<p><br />M.1.2 FACTOR #2 - PAST PERFORMANCE. Offeror(s) shall submit information as indicated in Section L, Paragraph L.1.2 in this solicitation. Information provided in the proposal shall include similar contracts with Federal, State, and local governments, as well as commercial businesses. Similar contracts are defined as those similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to this procurement.</p>
<p>M.1.2.1 Performance Evaluation. The Government will evaluate the offeror's, and (if applicable) its principal subcontractors' demonstrated past performance in delivering quality services and in meeting schedule requirements on similar programs. The performance risk assessment will address the probability of the offeror successfully accomplishing the contract requirements based on relevant past performance. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance will be considered. Problems not addressed by the offeror will be considered to still exist.</p>
<p>Each offeror will be evaluated to the extent to which they demonstrate satisfactory performance on contracts or subcontracts currently ongoing or completed within the last three (3) years. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in evaluating the offeror's past performance. Past performance is an indicator of how current and/or previous customers assess contractor performance under a specific contract performed for them and address the full range of all functions required to make any contractual relationship work. Successful past performance indicates that a contractor understands and has the resources to successfully execute a contract; however, it does not necessarily mean a contractor has the resources and skills necessary to perform the specific work requirements of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Evaluation of past performance will be based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. The evaluation will include demonstrated past performance in quality of product or service, schedule, business relations, and customer satisfaction. The following table identifies the adjectival ratings and descriptions utilized in rating past performance history:</p>
<p>ADJECTIVAL RATING DEFINITION<br />Satisfactory Performance MET contractual requirements. <br />Unsatisfactory Performance DID NOT MEET contractual requirements.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance will receive a "neutral" rating, that will have neither a positive nor negative effect. If there is no record of relevant past performance, offerors must affirmatively state this.</p>
<p>M.1.3 FACTOR #3 - PRICE. Offerors shall submit price/proposal as indicated in Section L, Paragraph L.1.3 in this solicitation. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition. Evaluation Factors: Lowest Price Technically Acceptable <BR> <BR>The Government reserves the right to increase and decrease the Period of Performance dates due to mission requirement. In the event this happens, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within 12-24 hours to make adjustments accordingly. The Government will not be charged for mission changes. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS Monday 8 April 2013 AT 1300EST .

<DESC><strong>AMENDMENT 1 TO RFQ IHS1197648 is&nbsp;issued to respond to vendor questions.<br /></strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;1.</strong> <strong>QUOTER QUESTION/COMMENT: </strong>I was considering bidding this solicitation, however there is not a convertible booster seat that is both rated 5 stars in ease of use and 30-100# listed by the NHTSA on their list. I have looked at the Cosco and Graco lines, (As well as a few others), and can't seem to meet the criteria set on the solicitation. Also, the list provided (by the NHTSA) is somewhat out of date, and several of those models are no longer produced. As we are a Native American owned business, I feel it is important to meet the necessary safety requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESPONSE:</strong>&nbsp;All the child safety seats (combination and boosters) listed at the NHTSA website meets Federal Standards and strict crash performance standards. This is the most important aspect of the selecting the child safety seat. Vendor should review listing of the seats at the NHTSA site. The major difference (rated by stars) is their ease of use and rated in four categories (not necessary part of the crash performance standards) includes: 1) evaluation of instructions; 2) evaluation of labels 3) vehicle installation features and 4) securing the child. Vendors should refer to the website for safety seat that meet the Federal Safety Standards and crash performance specifications.&nbsp; <br /><strong><br />2. QUOTER QUESTION/COMMENT:</strong> Are we allowed to provide a separate line item cost for seats sent to Alaska? Can you provide the minimum number of seats which will be shipped to Alaska. Can you provide the maximum of seats which will be shipped to Alaska?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RESPONSE:</strong> One unit price for Line Item 1 and one unit price for Line Item 2 is required. The quantities are stated on the spreadsheet that is attached to the original RFQ posting. <br /><br /><strong>3. QUOTER QUESTION/COMMENT:</strong> Was there a prior, similar contract for car seats? If yes, is there a bid available for this contract?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RESPONSE:</strong> Car seat purchase orders have been awarded in previous years, different quantities and locations. A summary of last year's quote prices is attached.&nbsp; <br /><strong><br />4. QUOTER QUESTION/COMMENT:</strong> Based on the requirements listed in the Solicitation for IHS1197648, there is only one model of booster seat which meets the NHTSA Federal Safety Standard of five stars overall ease of use and accommodates a child weighing 30 -100 lbs. That same model meets the requirement for both line items: 1.Highback with removable back booster seat and 2. High Rise Backless Booster seat. According to the NHTSA chart, that model is the Eddie Bauer Model 22-888-SDU. The other model of High Rise Backless Booster which meets the 5 star NHTSA rating accommodates children weighing 40 - 100 lbs. Please confirm that both the 5 star NHTSA rating and the weight requirement of 30 - 100 lbs applies to both line items which are being requested.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RESPONSE:</strong>&nbsp;The five stars rating refers to ease of use that are rated in four categories (not necessary part of the crash performance standards) includes: 1) evaluation of instructions; 2) evaluation of labels 3) vehicle installation features and 4) securing the child. Vendors should refer to the website for safety seat that meet the Federal Safety Standards and crash performance specifications.<br /><br /><strong>THE RFQ CLOSING DATE/TIME OF&nbsp;APRIL 3, 2013, 4:00 CENTRAL STANDARD TIME IS NOT CHANGED.&nbsp;&nbsp;THE DEADLINE FOR QUESTIONS HAS PASSED AND NEW&nbsp;QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</strong>&nbsp;

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

FAR 52.232-34 -- Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer -Other Than Central Contractor Registration (May 1999)

(a) Method of payment.

(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.

(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--

(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or

(ii) Request the Government to extend payment due dates until such time as the Government makes payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).

(b) Mandatory submission of Contractor's EFT information. 

(1) The Contractor is required to provide the Government with the information required to make payment by EFT (see paragraph (j) of this clause). The Contractor shall provide this information directly to the office designated in this contract to receive that information (hereafter: ``designated office'') by no later than 15 days prior to submission of the first request for payment. If not otherwise specified in this contract, the payment office is the designated office for receipt of the Contractor's EFT information. If more than one designated office is named for the contract, the Contractor shall provide a separate notice to each office. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the designated office(s).

(2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the designated office. However, EFT information supplied to a designated office shall be applicable only to contracts that identify that designated office as the office to receive EFT information for that contract.

(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.

(d) Suspension of payment. (1) The Government is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.

(2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of this contract, the Contractor's request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days of the suspension.

(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 

(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--

(i) Making a correct payment;

(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and

(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.

(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--

(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or

(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (d) shall apply.

(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.

(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (j) of this clause to the designated office, and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.

(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractor's financial agent.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract.

(j) EFT information. The Contractor shall provide the following information to the designated office. The Contractor may supply this data for this or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause). The Contractor shall designate a single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing the EFT information using the EFT methods described in paragraph (c) of this clause.

(1) The contract number (or other procurement identification number).

(2) The Contractor's name and remittance address, as stated in the contract(s).

(3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this information.

(4) The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the Contractor's financial agent.

(5) The Contractor's account number and the type of account (checking, saving, or lockbox).

(6) If applicable, the Fedwire Transfer System telegraphic abbreviation of the Contractor's financial agent.

(7) If applicable, the Contractor shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the Contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fedwire Transfer System; and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire transfer payment.

(End of clause)

(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and

(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples.

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.

(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).

This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. 

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

<DESC>ATEC Policy Bulletin 2-11, Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) Involving Contractors in Support of ATEC Test and Evaluation (T&E) dated 19 April 2011, establishes policy to ensure that contracts awarded in support of ATEC are free of actual or potential OCI.  <br>   <br> This Policy Bulletin states that contractors may work on Army system development programs to the exclusion of participating in ATEC test and evaluation support contracts. Alternatively, they may participate in ATEC test and evaluation support contracts to the exclusion of working on Army system development programs. This is the only reliable and effective means of avoiding violations of Title 10, United States Code, Section 2399(d). Therefore, with respect to ATEC test and evaluation service support contracts, contracts will not be awarded for operational or developmental test and evaluation support to prime contractors or affiliates that are executing Army developmental programs. This is because test and evaluation support contractors may be required to evaluate the products and services of developers, their subcontractors and suppliers. <br>  <br> The use of an advisory multi-step OCI evaluation process in accordance with FAR 15.202 is anticipated for this upcoming requirement. Phase I will be a review of any potential OCI concerning contractor affiliation with Army developmental testing. Based on this review, the respondent shall be advised (a) that they do not have an OCI or (b) that it has been determined that they have an OCI that cannot be mitigated and therefore they are considered unlikely to be a viable competitor. Phase II will be the evaluation of each offeror's full proposal. This two-step process will allow potential vendors with OCIs that cannot be mitigated to avoid the time and costs involved with preparing a full proposal.  <br>  <br> The Government anticipates that Phase I of this process, the OCI evaluation, will not take place before July 2013. Instructions regarding this process will be posted to FBO when they are available. <br>  <br> POC: Karen Barrett, karen.l.barrett2.civ@mail.mil <br>     <br> THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.     <br>

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 07 - 544 - Columbia, SC is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

The DLIS Unites States/Canada Joint Certification Lookup service is available via the Internet at: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/ccal/.;</p>
<p><br />*Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. ;</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP on its issue date of (on or about) 03/04/2013.</p>
<p>Drawings/specifications will be available through DIBBS.</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: RAYTHEON TECHNICAL SERVICES (3B150)</p>

<p>"The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., 'Offeror A'). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."<br /><br /><br />Amendment 0001 was issued on 03/29/2013 to extend the previous Opening/Closing Date 04/03/2013 to 04/26/2013 (1:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time).</p>

Services must be commercially available, meet industry standards for performance and transmission, be capable of interfacing with GSA's existing and future long distance services, and have capabilities and capacities to meet current and potential Government needs.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: The Government anticipates an eight (8) year contract performance period, inclusive of both base period and option periods. <br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted. This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform the resultant contract, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The successful offeror will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. One or more firm fixed price (FFP) indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are anticipated to be awarded. The successful offeror awarded the resultant contract shall be authorized to provide telecommunication services in the State of Alaska (and any subset thereof, i.e. borough, as applicable). Proof of this certification from the applicable authorities (i.e. State Public Utility Commissions, municipalities, etc.) shall be provided with submission of proposals.</p>
<p>The solicitation shall require submission of proposal prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15. The solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award, using the best value trade-off approach, upon the basis of the initial offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA FAS R10 contemplates awarding one or more Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts to the successful offeror(s) that demonstrates the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. NOTE: At time of this Synopsis posting, it is the Government's intent to identify geographic areas within the State of Alaska which will each be awarded one FFP IDIQ contract, thus permitting a multiple single-award IDIQ strategy wherein one offeror may be awarded more than one geographic area, but no one geographic area shall have more than one IDIQ awarded as a result of this Solicitation. Final determination and further information related to this concept shall be provided in the RFP once issued, if applicable.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFP will be issued electronically on or about 3/18/2013 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.</p>

<a href="mailto:kevin.armillotti@va.gov">Contract Specialist Intern</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to the questions submitted for VA798-13-I-0104. 

Questions and Answers

1.	Where is the location and size of the call center, Albuquerque/Santa Fe?

Answer:  There is no VA requirement for the facilities to be in any specific location so long as the services are appropriately provided. The size of the call center(s) would be up to the vendor to propose based on the information provided in the solicitation if one is forthcoming. 

2.	How many chairs will the call center occupy? 

Answer: How many chairs that a given call center would occupy would be up to an interested vendor to determine in their submittal based upon the information provided in the solicitation if one is forthcoming. 

3.	Will you consider using several staffing companies such as a primary and a secondary service?

Answer:  The Government considers the choice of subcontractors to be a vendor decision, holding the prime contractor responsible for management of subs.

4.	NAICS- What is this code?  We are familiar with SAIC but not this code.

Answer: The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is a standard industry classification system. 

5.	What is Independent Clinical Licensure and are we required to recruit?  

Answer:  This is related to mental health services and this credential is required to provide psychological advice in the event a crisis call is received by the call center.  The determination of recruitment would be dependent on the vendor's staffing model.

6.	 The Cover Sheet and Index are one page each in the Sources Sought.  The "replies to all of the questions below" are no more than 15 pages.  We assume that the Cover Sheet and the Index are additional to the 15 pages to reply to the three questions in the Sources Sought.  Is that correct?

Answer: Correct. 

7.	Is this expanded support to an existing service contract or a new contract for these services?

Answer:  The services currently are being procured through use of an Interagency Agreement.  

8.	If there is an existing service contract, who is the incumbent and what is the contract/task order number? 

 Answer: The services currently are being procured through use of an Interagency Agreement.  VA cannot, however, provide the details of those contract(s) because they are not VA procurement vehicles.


9.	What is the number of multiple call centers required and what are their location requirements? Are these locations co-located with a contractor providing services currently or the Government?    Will the contractor be expected to support existing call centers, either Government or another contractors, or will they stand up their own call center(s)

Answer:  Existing call centers are contractor owned.  There is no requirement at this time.  Call center locations and number would be proposed by the vendor if a solicitation is posted.  


10.	What are the locations of the current Call Centers?  

Answer:  There is no VA requirement for the facilities to be in any specific location so long as the services are appropriately provided. 

11.	Please describe the interface/workflow requirements with the existing contractor and/or the Government for the CMS, Security, Hiring Events, Training, Coaching, Call Center operations and Reporting.  

Answer:  The information provided in the Sources Sought is all that the Government is willing to share at this time. 

12.	The solicitation requests support in identifying enhancements to the Case Management System (CMS), will the Government provide access to the CMS prior to the release of the RFP for an appropriate evaluation of its capabilities?

Answer:  No, CMS access is limited to authorized government and current vendor staff.  Please note, there is no solicitation at this time.

13.	What type of CMS is being used and is it Government or Contractor owned?

Answer:  The CMS is built on the Appian6 platform that has automated the defined Veteran population identification, tracking, and notification processes.  In addition, it includes the integration of the case management system to other solution technology components (Monster, PDRI, Three Wire), the VA Human Resources Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) system, and VA Training Management System (TMS).  This is a Government owned system with some content through subscription from other services.


14.	Will the contractor assume an existing case load in the CMS that is pre-populated with records or will this program begin with an empty database or strictly new clients?   

Answer:   Contractor will assume existing caseload.

15.	What are the security requirements for the Call Center and for the Staff?  Are there any DIACAP requirements?

Answer:  Contractor staff must complete required training for access to VA information and must successfully complete a low risk background investigation.

16.	Support includes participating in Hiring Events - will the Government provide a list of Hiring Events, to include the dates of the events and their locations, that it participated in within the last 12 months and the level of efforts associated with that participation?

Answer:  There was one hiring event in the past 12 months that was attended by 8000 veterans.

17.	Support request includes providing Instructor-led and Web based training - what is the frequency for this requirement and the training topics?

Answer:  The number of training classes required (both instructor led and web based) would be specified in a solicitation, if issued. 

18.	Will the Government provide the platform and training modules or will the Contractor be required to host or design and develop training?

Answer:  The contractor will be provided existing training modules and will be required to design and develop any new training modules.  Web based training, once developed, would be hosted on VA's Talent Management System or within the VA for Vets program portal.

19.	Requirement asks how our organization will respond to call surges - what is the average monthly call volume?  Will the government provide a monthly call volume for the last 12 months?

Answer:  VA has provided case volumes as part of the sources sought as well as information that volumes may increase per the troop draw downs. 

20.	What is the anticipated increase (numbers and percent) in monthly call volume, hiring events, webinars, training, coaching, and help desk support due to the impending troop draw downs?

Answer:  There is no identified number or percentage increase available at this time.

21.	If an RFP is expected to be released, what is the anticipated date for release?

Answer: There is no anticipated date at this time. 

22.	What is the anticipated period of performance for this effort?

Answer: The anticipated period or performance would be a twelve (12) month base period with four twelve (12) month option periods. 

23.	What is the anticipated contract type?

Answer: Firm-Fixed Price

24.	Does the VA have a sponsor in place for this program who is driving this effort and if so, who is it? 
Answer: The Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration.

25.	What technology/application is used for the Case Management System (CMS)?

Answer:  The CMS is built on the Appian6 platform that has automated the defined Veteran population identification, tracking, and notification processes.  In addition, it includes the integration of the case management system to other solution technology components (Monster, PDRI, Three Wire), the VA Human Resources Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) system, and VA Training Management System (TMS).

26.	Is the VA looking for any specific or preferred certifications? 

Answer:  The VA prefers HDI certification of the vendor's call center(s).





27.	Are you able to advise if there is similar or related work being provided?  If so, could you please provide the contractor's name, contract number, award date, expiration date, and value?

Answer: The services currently are being procured through use of an Interagency Agreement.  VA cannot, however, provide the details of those contract(s) because they are not VA procurement vehicles.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to patent or data rights requirements, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because it was not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. As such, a time-and-materials type action was awarded for commercial supplies and services (FAR 12.207(b)). <br>  <br> ERP Professional Consulting Services.

The contractor shall prepare a quote that includes up to eleven distinct audits and will result in distinct audit reports which will be tailored to each audit awardee in SOW:
<p>Audit #6 - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</p>
<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is located in Champaign, IL.  The Institution currently has 787 active NSF awards totaling $578,566,023.  This includes 71 ARRA awards totaling $32,645,169 and cumulative expenditures of $357,688,354 as of June 30, 2012.  The Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133 FY 2011 audit report identified several findings which were repeated for the third consecutive year.  These findings relate to  documentation of payroll and fringe benefit expenditures, documentation of cost transfers, certification that vendors were not on EPLS, proper calculation of interest on federal funds drawn in advance, documentation of sub recipient monitoring, following property management regulations, and formal review and approval of cash draw and reimbursement request calculation. In addition, several findings were repeated for a second year, including issues related to timely closing of federal projects, accurate reporting of expenditures related to ARRA awards in the Section 1512 reports, reporting of expenditures in the proper accounting period, documentation to support charges related to "key personnel,"  and timely submission of quarterly financial reports.  Finally, the auditors found that the University did not have processes in place to ensure expenditures used to meet cost sharing requirements are allowable or to ensure that grant award amounts are accurately recorded in the accounting system; did not document supervisory reviews of quarterly financial reports; did not properly charge fringe benefit rates to NSF awards; and did not accurately report information on the quarterly financial reports.</p>
<p>Audit #10 - The University of Wisconsin - Madison</p>
<p>The University of Wisconsin - Madison is located in Madison, Wisconsin.  The Institution currently has 710 active NSF awards totaling $670,713,779.  This includes 64 ARRA awards totaling $34,316,945 and cumulative expenditures of 539,978,004 as of June 30, 2012.  The FY 2011 Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133 audit identified two findings which were reported for the third consecutive year, including that the University continues to have material errors on its grant schedules, and continues to have issues related to equipment records and inventory of equipment purchased with federal funds.</p>
<p>Each audit shall be a Cost Incurred Performance Audit that shall be conducted in accordance with the standards applicable to performance audits contained in Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), 2011 revision, or the most current version, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, specifically Chapters 1 through 3, and Chapters 6 and 7.</p>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 6, Salem Medical Center, PR 658-13-2-5074-0562.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of filter devices for the mitigation of Legionella from the vendor Pall Medical.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  On Friday February 22, 2013 the leadership of the Salem VAMC elected to take decisive action to address results from recent testing of the domestic water system showing increased levels of Legionella. This request is for point-of-use water filters, connection hardware and adaptors for faucets and showers in in-patient areas for the control and mitigation of Legionella. The Installation of these point-of-use filters will reduce the likelihood that patients will become infected.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The vendor, Pall Medical, was
recommended by Nalco, the technical services vendor assisting the Medical Center with an action plan for mitigating the Legionella, as having immediate availability of the appropriate filtration devices.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  None

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Similar filters and components were reviewed on GSA Advantage and the prices were in line or more expensive with the prices charged by Pall Medical.  

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  GSA Advantage was surveyed for filters with a pore size small enough to trap the bacteria, no filters were found.  Due to the specialized nature of the products and the ability for Pall medical to deliver the components overnight, no further searches were conducted.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Pall Medical.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The station is working to determine if other vendors offer the specialized filters to promote competition when the installed filters require replacement.  As the filter life is known, replacement filters can be competed among vendors prior to the filter change dates.
