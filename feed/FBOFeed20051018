<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 06-01 Mission Adaptable Chemical Sensor (MACS).  

BAA CLOSING DATE: One year after the date of publication of this announcement in FedBizOpps.gov and FedGrants.gov; FULL PROPOSALS FOR INITIAL SELECTIONS DUE: 1200 noon EST on 5 December 2005.  POC: Dr. Frank Patten, DARPA/ATO, 3701 Fairfax Drive, Arlington VA 22203-1714; Email: BAA06-01@darpa.mil; Web: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/MACS/index.htm.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the Mission Adaptable Chemical Sensor (MACS) program.  The objective of the program is to successfully demonstrate a portable (< 1 cubic foot, < 30 lbs), ultra-sensitive (parts-per-trillion detection capability) chemical sensor based upon submillimeter/terahertz rotational spectroscopy.  This technology takes advantage of the quantized nature of rotational motion for gas phase materials, and provides unique chemical spectra for multiple analytes in parallel, with very little interference from background atmospheric clutter.  Further, rotational spectroscopy allows detection of many chemicals simultaneously, in a single sample, over a wide range of concentrations, without significant compromise in probability of detection or increase in false alarm rate.  

The Mission Adaptable Chemical Sensor (MACS) will be capable of sampling the local atmosphere and determining the presence of chemical, biological, and explosives threats by means of their gaseous signatures.  This program asserts that unambiguous identification of such threats can be accomplished only by the rapid, simultaneous identification of the suite of gaseous chemicals that constitute their “signature”; accordingly, the sensor must be capable of identifying at least 300 molecular species in a single sample of the local atmosphere, within 10 minutes.  The sensor must have a 0.9999 probability of threat detection and 0.0001 probability of false alarm.

Pursuant to the program objectives, this BAA solicits proposals that include (but are not limited to) the following technology areas: (1) Technologies and systems to fabricate a portable chemical sensor, enabling the detection and identification of multiple threats (explosives, chemical, biological) to ground personnel; (2) Spectroscopic techniques that sensitively detect, discriminate, and identify chemicals characteristic of particular threats, in an atmospheric background; (3) Radio-frequency sources and detectors, in the submillimeter regime, that are sufficiently small for portable instrumentation, and with adequate operating power; (4) Gas sampling and micro-pumping systems to acquire, process, and move chemical and biological materials; and (5) Signal processing and analytical technologies to enable the detection and accurate identification of components of an atmospheric sample containing threat gases.  The Government strongly encourages proposals for the full scope of the development (i.e., an end-to-end system that is designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support).  The Government also encourages proposals for more narrowly-focused technology maturation that has a potential to enhance the objective system dramatically.  

This BAA affords offerors the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Procurement Contract, Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Technology Investment Agreement, or Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiation.

Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria, in descending order of importance: (a) Technical Approach; (b) Prior experience and performance in this technology area; (c) Depth and breadth of the applied personnel; (d) Potential contribution and relevance to the DARPA mission; and (e) Cost reasonableness and realism.  Since no common work statement exists, each proposal will be evaluated on its own merit as it relates to the program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area.
 
This BAA shall remain open through one year after the date of publication of this announcement in FedBizOpps.gov and FedGrants.gov.  Although the Government may receive responses at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  In order to be considered for initial selections, full proposals must be received by the Government no later than 1200 noon on 5 December 2005.

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  One or more technology areas may receive no funding.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  Also the Government reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  In that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 § 217 and PL 05-261 § 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

Additional information regarding program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, and proposal preparation and submittal is available in the Proposers’ Information Pamphlet (PIP) associated with this BAA.

This program requires deployment of geophysical and acoustic data acquisition equipment to assist in the identification of small size, natural, and man-made sources.  This contract will also provide research and development utilizing such equipment.  SMU is uniquely suited for this work due to the existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Korean Institute of Geology, Mining, and Materials (KIGAM) and SMU to operate and sustain seismic and acoustic arrays in the Republic of Korea.   

This sole source acquisition is justified under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Evaluation of the contractor's unique capability and acquisition history concluded that the highly specialized effort required is available from only one source.  A cost contract is contemplated with a one-year basic contract period (1 Jan 06 – 31 Dec 06) with two 1-year options.  AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman is applicable.

 JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (JOTFOC)


Procurement Request #216B4500MG039

The ELC intends to purchase the following item(s) for support of the 270WMEC vessels.
   	
NSN: 3040-01-103-6565
NAME: cylinder, hydraulic	
P/N: P161603-1


2.	By authority granted under 10 USC 2304 (C) (1) and FAR subpart 6.302-1, I have 
determined that negotiations shall be conducted only with Rexroth (OEM), or their distributors.

3.	The manufactures drawings and specifications for this item are proprietary commercial property of the proposed contractor.   Due to the proprietary rights imposed by the contactor, the Coast Guard has not purchased this information. The present information on file for this item is unsuitable to make a determination if any other manufacture’s product would be a suitable replacement.   Use of OEM product listed above is the only guarantee that form, fit and function 
of the product will be met.

4.	This cylinder is an existing component on the 270 WMEC vessels. The above cylinder has already been provisioned for and repair parts for this cylinder are currently in the federal stock system. Any attempt to procure an “or equal item” competitively would duplicate cost to the government for new provisioning efforts and for repair parts to be supported. In addition, this cylinder must conform to exact design and materials requirements for form, fit and function to interface with the hydraulic fin stabilizer system.

5.	The above product is used in the Hydraulic fin stabilizer system and any failure would be detrimental to the system making it inoperable and likely jeopardize personnel safety and/or the vessels primary mission.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a sole source contract modification to Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Inc. (NGSS), 1000 Access Road, Pascagoula, MS 38567, for the detail design and construction requirements for the LHA(R) Flight 0 Amphibious Assault Ship, which has been designated as the LHA 6.   The modification will be awarded under existing Contract N00024-05-C-2221 with NGSS that provides for the procurement of Long Lead-Time Material (LLTM) components and their associated logistics support, systems engineering, and planning, and which includes options for engineering/detail design for the LHA(R) Flight 0 ship and for special studies to develop/refine the requirements for all ships of the LHA(R) Program.  The notional delivery date for the LHA 6 is June 2012.  It is planned that the requirements for detail design and construction will be awarded no later than the first quarter of FY 2007.  In the event that additional funding and Congressional authorizatio!  n is provided in FY 2006, award of the detail design and construction requirements may be accelerated as well as the procurement of additional LLTM in FY 2006.  The LHA 6 will be a modified variant of the LHD 1 Class Amphibious Assault Ships.  The requirements for LHA 6 will require detailed knowledge and familiarity with critical technical details, design, configuration, and performance characteristics of the LHD 1 Class.  NGSS has designed and constructed all LHA and LHD Class Amphibious Assault Ships, including LHD 8, which is currently under construction.  As the sole designer and shipbuilder for these ship types, only NGSS possesses the requisite knowledge and experience to satisfactorily perform the requirements without considerable Government intervention and assistance.  Therefore, NGSS is deemed the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Government’s requirements.  Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact N!  GSS directly as follows: POC: Joan Branson, Telephone: (228) 935-5545,  Mailing Address: PO Box 149, Pascagoula, MS 39568-0149, E-mail: joan.branson@ngc.com.  See Numbered Note 22.!!

Along with Linear Accelerator, the Eclipse IMX Workstation software is designed to help the radiation therapists and physicians to accurately plan the best course of treatment for each individual patient.  Radiation treatment of patients with various kinds of cancers requires ongoing exposure to radiation.  Varian Medical Systems is the sole manufacturer of the Eclipse IMX Workstation software.  It is critical that only factory trained technicians service this workstation due to hardware and software that is specific to these machines. Knowledge of proprietary information is critical in keeping this machine up to date and running with minimal down time.  Ongoing exposure is critical to the treatment of patients and therefore requires a specific schedule of exposure and precise and timely doses.  

Service agreement requirements:  Contractor shall provide all labor, material, equipment and major parts included in coverage.   All maintenance services shall be performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s standard commercial maintenance practices. Contractor shall provide scheduled preventative maintenance inspections per contract period of performance.   Emergency repair service shall be provided twenty-four hours daily, seven days a week.   For software updates, the contractor shall provide Software Service in accordance with the manufacturer’s latest established service procedures, to include telephone access to technical support for use of program software and trouble shooting of the operating systems, at no additional cost to the Government.  The warranty on the workstation is only guaranteed if the workstation is serviced by Varian Engineers.  

Period of Performance: November 1, 2005 – October 31, 2006.   Varian Medical Systems is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned service agreement requirements to maintain the highest level of professional care in operation and maintenance for our patients.  

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

The period of performance will begin On November 1, 2005 through May, 1 2006.   The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order for immunohistochemical characterization of cells with Helen Hayes Hospital using simplified acquisition procedures.  The period of performance is anticipated to be twelve (12) months starting November 15, 2005.

Brain sections will be examined using standard Nissl staining procedures and specialized immunohistochemical  techniques in brains of rats treated throughout gestation and lactation with the thyrotoxic chemicals, propylthiouricil (PTU). Work to be accomplished under the purchase order is a continuation of research previously performed by the proposed awardee under another EPA purchase order. The EPA  believes that Helen Hayes Hospital is the only source capable of satisfying the Government's requirements as stated above.  The circumstance permitting soliciting from a single source is FAR 13.106-1, "...contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that  the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available..."  Interested persons seeking to challenge the sole source justification must present, in writing, clear and convincing evidence of their capability to provide the requirements within 15 days after the date of  publication of this notice.  Any response failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of an RFQ will be ignored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based on this notice is solely  within the discretion of the Government.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  No RFP/RFQ is available.  Submit responses to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attention:  Anna Mustard, RTP Procurement  Operations Div. (E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.

This activity will include identifying the requirements for providing the transmission infrastructure necessary for Aceh to receive power from current and proposed facilities.  This project will also help Aceh to upgrade the 150kV line between Bireun and Banda Aceh along Aceh’s north coast, build a connecting transmission line from Bireun southwest across the island to Meulaboh, and construct another transmission line from Meulaboh north to Banda Aceh.  In addition, this project will include the construction of new substations at various points along the transmission lines. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $394,650 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency has a requirement for an upgrade to the Early Warning Radar (EWR) located at Thule Air Base (AB), Greenland.  This upgrade shall retain commonality with the ongoing upgrades to the EWRs located at Beale Air Force Base, CA and RAF Fylingdales, United Kingdom.  Under this effort, the contractor is required to produce hardware and software upgrade kits, design and modify the Thule EWR facility to accomplish the hardware and software EWR upgrades, adapt the upgraded EWR baseline for Thule deployment (i.e., accommodate site specific issues), install the hardware and software upgrade kits, and provide support to completion of force development evaluation of the upgraded Thule AB EWR into the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system.  MDA intends to award a contract to the Raytheon Corporation for this effort.  MDA intends this contract to be firm-fixed-price for the upgraded hardware, and cost-plus-award-fee for the software and facility upgrades. This contract award to the Raytheon Corporation will be under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1-(a) (ii): only one responsible source.  Raytheon, the radar manufacturer and developer of the upgrades of the EWRs at Beale and Fylingdales, is the only company that can provide the required upgrade to meet a 2008 deployment schedule without a significant duplication of cost to the Government.  An award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in deploying additional capabilities to the radar at Thule AB and require a significant duplication of costs while another contractor establishes the facilities and expertise to accomplish the upgrade.  A Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition is in process.

<DESC>AIDS Support and Technical Assistance Resources (AIDSTAR) Program 

Introduction: The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)

The President’s Emergency Plan works in over 120 countries around the world, with a special emphasis on 15 countries in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.  In the 15 focus countries, which are home to approximately half of HIV infections worldwide, the President’s Emergency Plan aims to support treatment for at least two million people living with HIV/AIDS, prevent seven million new infections, and support care for 10 million people infected with and affected by HIV, including orphans. 

To ensure accountability and results for the President’s Emergency Plan, in 2003 the President created the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator at the Department of State, responsible for overseeing all USG international HIV/AIDS assistance and for coordinating the efforts of the various agencies and departments.
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), headquartered in Washington, D.C., is an independent federal government agency that receives overall foreign policy guidance from the Secretary of State.  USAID is a major implementing partner in the President’s Emergency Plan and currently supports HIV/AIDS programs in the 15 Emergency Plan focus countries and approximately 100 other countries worldwide.  The award described below will be accessible to all of these countries.
The Award

Under the Emergency Plan, USAID intends to competitively award several Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQC) for the AIDS Support and Technical Assistance Resources (AIDSTAR) Program.  These contracts are intended to provide state-of-the-art technical assistance and implementation support for the expansion of high-quality HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment services, and to build in-country technical and management capacity to sustain these services. The goal is to decrease HIV transmission, morbidity and mortality in program areas and to improve the quality of life for affected populations.  The awards will contribute to the President’s Emergency Plan in mitigating the impact of AIDS on individuals, families and communities in both Emergency Plan focus and other countries.

The U.S. Government seeks to make a total of up to fourteen (14) awards under the AIDSTAR IQC in two separate sectors: Sector (1) Prevention, Care and Treatment (up to eight awards); and Sector (2) Institutional Capacity Building (up to six awards.)

•	Awards under Sector 1 will provide technical expertise and implementation support for the expansion of HIV/AIDS services across the continuum of prevention, care, and treatment.  Through new and existing partnerships, it will also support and strengthen the technical capacity of a broad range of in-country partner institutions to deliver high-quality, effective interventions. Partnering with indigenous institutions is a key element of sector 1.  

•	Awards under Sector 2 will support broader institutional development for long-term sustainability of in-country partners, for example, strengthening management and financial accountability systems of local organizations and government agencies. 

Each sector will include up to two (2) set-asides for small, minority-owned and/or women-owned businesses.   

Non-profits, for-profits, universities, private voluntary agencies and faith-based organizations (FBOs) with expertise in HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment, and any combination of the above, are invited to submit proposals for Sector 1.  For Sector 2, USAID is especially interested in organizational management and accounting firms and other non-profit and for-profit organizations with prior experience strengthening the management capacity of public and private institutions in the developing world.

USAID encourages new and non-traditional partners that can add value to the U.S. Government’s HIV/AIDS assistance to participate either as primes or as partners within consortia, especially institutions in developing countries/regions and organizations that represent People Living With AIDS (PLWA).   Given the broad scope of the program and array of skills needed to carry out the scope of work, USAID will consider consortia of organizations, where these consortia demonstrate clear complementarities of expertise and division of responsibility to effectively implement the range of proposed activities in the field and strengthen capacity.  Such consortia will be expected to propose management arrangements that effectively integrate the contributions and strengths of different partners. Organizations that provide an “umbrella” structure to coordinate and support technical assistance provided by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), FBOs and other partners, including those in the developing world, are invited to submit proposals.   USAID hopes to attract offerors that demonstrate commitment to local ownership, capacity strengthening and sustainability, as well as technical excellence in HIV/AIDS programming. USAID seeks partners that are cost-effective, offer best value, and keep management and overhead costs low.  

Technical Summary 

The scope of the AIDSTAR program is broad. It will encompass prevention interventions in countries with generalized epidemics as well as those with epidemics largely concentrated among high-risk groups.  It will support expansion of the entire continuum of care and support interventions, including clinical, home-based, psycho-social and orphan care.  It will also support the delivery and expansion of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to slow the progression of disease in PLWA, using the “network model” of referral linkages between different levels and types of health services and facilities.  

The program will give special emphasis to linkages, referral networks and integration across these different HIV/AIDS services, in order to support a comprehensive approach and take advantage of the synergies between prevention, treatment, and care.  Where there is a need, the program will also support program-related data collection and analysis, including operational research, behavioral surveys, situation analyses and formative research to provide the evidence base to guide the design and implementation of HIV services.  

Institutional capacity building of indigenous organizations is a key strategy for achieving the prevention, care and treatment goals of the Emergency Plan and for ensuring long-term sustainability of Emergency Plan-assisted programs. A major thrust of the AIDSTAR program will be to devolve skills and leadership to developing country institutions. It will support local partners in scaling-up state-of-the-art, best-practice interventions, and in building the management and financial systems to support these efforts. AIDSTAR will build the capacity of local partners and health networks across the public and private sectors, working with national and local governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as private businesses. When requested, it will also make technical and/or capacity building support available to the Country Coordination Mechanisms (CCMs) and Principal Recipients (PRs) of the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM).  
The emphasis will be on supporting affected countries in mounting comprehensive, effective and sustainable responses to the epidemic.  The program will support innovative modes of partnering to transfer expertise to developing country institutions, facilitate programs at the local level, expand the network of in-country partners and strengthen the HIV services they provide.  Performance will be measured in part by quantifiable capacity building and sustainability indicators. 

The AIDSTAR program is expected to play varying roles in different countries.  Where U.S. field Missions have limited staff and HIV budgets, it may serve as a mechanism to assist those Missions broadly in implementing their HIV/AIDS assistance programs.  In countries where U.S. Missions have more staff and resources, and have already identified implementing partners, AIDSTAR may serve primarily as a mechanism to access specialized technical or institutional strengthening expertise.

AIDSTAR will also help to advance excellence in HIV/AIDS programming by supporting technical leadership and knowledge management functions, for example, sharing lessons learned, best practices, innovations and state-of-the-art across countries.  


AIDSTAR is subject to the eligibility limitations on the use of funds and opposition to prostitution and sex trafficking identified in Section 301 (d), (e) and (f) of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003  (www.usaid.gov.business.cib.pdf.aapd05-04.)  Additionally, the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator will shortly be issuing guidelines on planning for sustainability for indigenous organizations.

The preferred method of distributing information pertinent to this procurement will be through Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov.)  All correspondence regarding this notice must be submitted in writing to Mr. Eduardo Elia, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20523, or by e-mail at eelia@usaid.gov.

<DESC>AMENDMENT TO SOLICITATION NUMBER RFI-05-02 OF AUG 5, 2005,
US-VISIT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT,
FOR ELECTRONIC MACHINE READABLE TRAVEL DOCUMENT (e-MRTD) READERS 


The Office of the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) is anticipating procuring electronic Machine-Readable Travel Document (eMRTD) readers through the Scientific and Engineering Workstation Procurement (SEWP) III, Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) contract vehicle, Class 12.  The website for SEWP III is www.sewp.nasa.gov. The SEWP website provides information as to how contractors can add new products to the SEWP contract via a Technology Refreshment process for the Prime contract holders (and their subcontractors).  New contractors who wish to have their products available through SEWP must contact one or more of the Prime contract holders and negotiate with their SEWP Program Managers to become an approved subcontractor through the Prime’s contract. The choice as to which contract holder to contact depends on which contract holder best fits your products.  See the SEWP website for specific detailed information.  In order to be awarded a delivery order under SEWP III your product must be available through SEWP. It is anticipated that a competitive RFQ will be issued under the SEWP GWAC as early as December 1, 2006.  

The eMRTD Readers must be capable of reading the Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ) and Integrated contactless chip in existing and planned International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) – compliant travel documents. 

For ease of integration, the eMRTD readers shall comply with the US-VISIT ePassport Reader API Specification and the updated US-VISIT eMRTD Reader requirements. The latest version of the specification and the eMRTD Reader requirements will be provided under separate cover to all contractors that expressed an interest in the e-MRTD Reader requirement under RFI -05-02 of August 5, 2005.  Any new contractors that are interested in receiving the US-VISIT ePassport Reader API Specification and eMRTD Reader requirements should contact the contracting officer listed below. 

First article testing of the awardee’s product will be required before approval to start production.  Specific requirements for first article testing will be provided in any resulting RFQ.  US-VISIT is planning to procure as many as 500 - 1,000 eMRTD Readers in the 2nd quarter of FY 2006. The eMRTD Readers are desired to be delivered to the government in lot sizes of 50 eMRTD Readers at a time. Reader procurements in FY 07 through FY10 are expected to be as many as 700 per year.  The procurement of these readers in the out-years may be accelerated, depending upon the availability of funds.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The estimated cost of construction is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. PROJECT SCOPE:  The project consists of the design and construction of approximately 90 kilometers (55.9 miles) two lane bituminous asphalt road, widening a number of culvert crossings and repairing one Bailey bridge.

The remaining kilometers is considered new road construction.  Site conditions may show that the existing base material may be suitable for use in some locations.  Drainage iss ues are unknown because of the unavailability of topographic information. CONTRACT PROCEDURES:  Both a price proposal and a technical proposal will be required.  The evaluation criteria will consist of pricing and non-pricing (technical) considerations.

Completeness of proposed prices will be evaluated by the Government based upon a comparison of the process proposed as compared against the requirements of the solicitation, scope of work and those costs included in the Governments Independent Government Estimate (IGE).  The reasonableness of prices proposed will be evaluated on the basis of a comparison of those prices with the prices propose d by the offerors and as contained with the Governments Independent Government Estimate (IGE).  Conclusions concerning likely future cost risk will be based upon the results of the Governments review and analysis of all aspects of the price proposals. Non-pricing factors include offerors Past Performance, Experience, and Management and Technical Capabilities.  Management and Technical capabilities will consist of at least four subfactors:  Management and Staff Organization, Subcontracting, Security Con siderations, and Execution Plan.

Via this integration, the contractor shall incrementally augment the security system and product configuration within the JATDI baseline releases with the addition of a data input mode for authoritative sources and enhance access controls to the document repository (Top-Tier) server farms, local subscribing caching (Mid-Tier) server and end user devices.  In addition to supplying hardware and software items, Cryptek, Inc. shall provide the installation, engineering services, operational support, testing and capability to securely access technical data via the World Wide Web (WWW) and to enable the secure handling of sensitive unclassified data within a wide area network series of systems.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.  NASA Headquarters Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is seeking qualified sources capable of the management and operations of its Infra-Red Telescope Facility (IRTF), a 3.0 meter telescope located at approximately 13,600 feet near the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii.  It is anticipated that performance will be for one year, with a possible extension for an additional two years.  NASA SMD is evaluating potential operation of the IRTF beyond 2008. The IRTF is operated by the Science Mission Directorate to provide timely observation of Solar System objects and planetary research data in support of spacecraft missions.  It may also be used as a platform to develop and demonstrate new technologies for planetary observations and future spacecraft missions.  Its primary objectives are to: 1)	Provide ground-based observation support for the planning and conduct of major, strategic planetary missions (i.e. Cassini, Mars Program), Discovery class missions (i.e Deep Impact, MESSENGER, Dawn), and New Frontiers missions (i.e. New Horizons, Juno). 2)	Support basic planetary research by supporting the conduct of observations by the planetary sciences community through grants awarded via competitive process. 3)	Support research on Near Earth Objects through use of the IRTF in a scientific program involving collaborations with members of the planetary sciences community. 4)	Establish technical and scientific collaboration with appropriate NASA centers, JPL and other space science institutions to foster instrument development for future spacecraft missions. The IRTF consists of the telescope designed for maximum performance in the infrared portion of the spectrum.  It has a 3.0 meter primary mirror with a f/35 Cassegrain focus at a multi-instrument mount for up to four instruments, and a f/120 coude’ focus for larger instruments.  Facility instruments are provided for data acquisition and are developed and maintained by the IRTF staff.  It also includes the observatory building at the summit which houses the telescope and all operations, support and maintenance work space, all computer equipment to control the telescope and support the collection of data (including a remote telescope control system for world-wide remote observers), and required HVAC and UPS systems.	There are also rooms and 2 offices at the Mauna Kea Mid-Level Facility (known as Hale Pohaku), located at approximately 9,000 feet, to support IRTF staff and visiting scientists when not working directly at the summit.   The telescope is operated on all nights of the year except for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Eve.  Other responsibilities of the include:  1) Management of telescope observing time based on recommendations of a national time allocation committee on proposals received from the science community; 2) Technical support to visiting astronomers in obtaining observations as required; and 3) Initiatives to develop and improve IRTF facilities and instrumentation to enhance the capability to support NASA space research and missions.  (Funding for visiting astronomer support and new instrumentation is primarily obtained through the National Science Foundation.) All institutions and individuals working at and with facilities on Mauna Kea are required to abide by all laws, rules, and regulations laid down by the State of Hawaii and by the University of Hawaii to preserve and protect the delicate environment of the mountain and the cultural significance of the site to native Hawaiians.  The State of Hawaii has set aside much of the summit area as a Science Reserve, leased to the University of Hawaii. The University has adopted a Master Plan to guide the use of the Reserve as a scientific complex while protecting it for the future. More information about this important aspect of IRTF management and operations can be found at the website of the Office of Mauna Kea Management:  http://www.malamamaunakea.org/site/management.php?article_id=18  The Mauna Kea Science Reserve Master Plan can be found at:  http://www.hawaii.edu/maunakea/18   No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. This sources sought synopsis is provided to assure inclusion of interested firms on the eventual solicitation source list and should not be seen as a formal solicitation document from which a contract will be awarded.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard (USCG)is seeking information from potential sources that have the capabilities to identify, design, install, test and certify a replacement for the Constant Speed Drive System (CSD) currently installed in the USCG’s fleet of HU-25 aircraft.  The current CSD system consists of a 20KVA Alternator which provides 115 VAC, three phase 400 cycles to the main AC bus and is driven by a constant speed hydraulic motor (CSM).  The CSM is powered by two independent engine driven hydraulic pumps.  CSD components have become some of the most significant mission readiness degraders on the airframe.  A modern AC Power Generation system will enhance HU-25 mission readiness and reduce life cycle costs.

All potential sources that can provide engineering analysis, development, integration and certification support of a commercial off the shelf AC power generating system replacement for the current CSD system are welcome to submit their comments.  The proposed system shall be capable of generating MIL-STD-704, three phase AC power rated at 12KVA minimum and have a documented Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of at least 2000 hours.  Copies of all company certifications and documentation should be submitted with comments.  HU-25 technical information (e.g. current Load analysis information, CSD system description, operation, and installation) can be obtained by contacting Petty Officer Cleveland Broome at 9252) 384-7101 (email Cleveland.G.Broome@uscg.mil) or Mr. J. J. Tirak at (252) 335-6877 (email James.J.Tirak@uscg.mil.  This is not a request for proposals.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine possible sources for CSD system replacement, increase mission readiness and to reduce costs to the Coast Guard.  Organizations having the required expertise and capabilities are invited to submit complete information packages along with a planning estimate for the proposed solution.  Comments do not constitute a proposal,but rather, will be considered as an open exchange of information and ideas.  The information contained therein shall pertain to this synopsis only.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information received.  Any interested organizations must submit their data in writing within 30 days of this announcement to Petty Officer Broome or Mr. J. J. Tirak at the address given above.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the source data received, nor will a source list be provided.

<SUBJECT>D -- Web-Based COTS for Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP)
<SOLNBR>DOCSSPAPT0610001
<RESPDATE>120505
<ARCHDATE>12202005
<CONTACT>Sylvia Van Dyke, Contracting Officer, Phone 571-272-6568, Fax 571-273-0284, Email sylvia.vandyke@uspto.gov
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO), is conducting market research to determine potential sources/companies which can meet the USPTO’s requirements for a web-based COTS product for the electronic publication and distribution of, and improved customer access to, the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP).
Background

The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) is used by patent examiners to help them make decisions about patentability of patent applications.  Patent applicants, patent practitioners, and the general public also use MPEP data to learn about patent examination and prosecution.

Currently, the MPEP data is published in three formats:  a proprietary format used to search and view the data under a client/server environment, HTML for Internet and PTO intranet access, and Portable Data Format (PDF).

Current Processing

The MPEP is updated once or twice a year, as Congress passes laws affecting its content.  Revisions arrive from various sources over a period of months and in various formats, including in MS Word files and even hand-written paper copies.  These revisions are then formatted (into SGML) for input to FrameMaker.  The FrameMaker document instances are extracted and converted into the three formats discussed above.

Current Capabilities

The current proprietary application provides an “electronic book” capability for the MPEP.  Some of the features that it provides are the following:

·	Fast search response time
·	Limited personal annotations, bookmarks, and highlighting
·	Limited searching capability, such as user selection of the search to be performed within a particular section with a particular title (a.k.a. contextual searching) and proximity searching.
·	Highlighting or underlining of search results within the document, with multiple capabilities provided to jump between hits (by page or section) 
·	Page display formatting, such as allowing for wide margins on which users can take notes after printing out the page
·	Scalability to handle a steadily increasing number of concurrent users.  Currently the MPEP user base includes 5,000 USPTO staff plus 40,000 public users.  We expect these numbers to double over the next few years.
Objectives for New Product

Some overall goals for a new capability include the use of a single web-based publishing channel, an intuitive search capability, and a customizable user interface.  Listed below are specific features:
1.	The COTS product should be web-based and platform independent, allowing scalable access by both internal USPTO users and external customers.
2.	The COTS product should provide for an intuitive, user-friendly interface and content display options, customizable by the user.  These customizations should be retainable for use in future sessions and content updates.
3.	The COTS product should provide intuitive, accurate, easy-to-use search capabilities, including flexible search options such as proximity searching, search by topic or category, search by chapter or section or all content, search archived versions, and search for similar or like concepts.
4.	The COTS product should provide the users with the capabilities to add bookmarks, annotations, and highlighting.  The bookmarks and annotations should be sharable, and retainable for use in future sessions and content updates.
5.	The COTS product should provide for easy copying and pasting to other applications.
6.	The COTS product should be capable of accepting different source formats for content updates such as MS Word, FrameMaker+ SGML, HTML, XML, JPEG, GIF, TIFF, and PDF.  It also should be capable of handling special characters such as those on the Unicode Character Map.
7.	The source data should be stored in a repository that allows updating and retrieval of data.  Changes made to the data should be tracked and stored in an archive.
8.	The COTS product should provide for hyperlinking between related elements within the documents (e.g., between related sections of the MPEP).  There will also be a need to link to external sources.
9.	The COTS product should provide intuitive, flexible output capabilities, including:
·	The capability to mimic standard Windows-type Print selection features (by page, by range, by paragraph, by highlighted selection, etc.).
·	The option to provide Portable Document Format (PDF) output, and
·	The capability to preserve the current presentation format.
10.	The COTS product should provide customizable online interactive testing capabilities to support the user’s preparation for USPTO certification exams.
11.	The COTS product should include role-based access to enable USPTO to use a single product to deliver content and control the options available to different user communities, such as internal versus public users.
12.	The COTS product should allow for frequent updating of the data by MPEP authors and editors through an intuitive and user-friendly interface that contains full editing and authoring functionality.  The interface should use standard Windows-based editing software to make and save changes.
·	COTS production environment must clearly show revisions during the editing process.
·	COTS production environment must allow access to multiple reviewers.
13.	The COTS product must be compliant with the appropriate Section 508 access and usability requirements.
14.	An electronic user’s guide should be provided.
15.	On-line training should be available, as well as assistance from the vendor for any problems encountered with the product.
16.	Instructions on product setup, installation, and maintenance should be provided.
17.	Another desired feature would be for the product to allow the data to be downloadable and searchable offline.
 
Other information:
1.	USPTO workstations currently operate under a Microsoft Windows XP operating system.
2.	USPTO servers include Windows 2000 and Unix machines.
3.	Current MPEP data is stored in several different formats, including FrameMaker7 (with SGML) and Oracle to support the existing production process.  These activities and formats must be simplified and significantly reduced.
4.	Although internal users generally work with Internet Explorer, external users are also using other available browsers such as Netscape, Mozilla, and Firefox.
5.	The MPEP currently contains approximately 3,100 pages.
6.	An increasing number of USPTO employees will have the capability to work from home and hotel workspaces, as well as from their office location at the USPTO campus in Alexandria, Virginia.
Interested companies which can meet the above requirements should respond no later than the specified response date of December 2, 2005 by 5:00 p.m. EST.  Companies may include any pertinent product information with product brochures.  Please indicate whether your product can be obtained through a GWAC or GSA contract schedule vehicle.

<DESC>Background

	The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Congressional Affairs and Communications Staff is responsible for Internet and Intranet web sites for the National Archives.  The Congressional Affairs and Communications Staff is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) for Application Service Provider (ASP) or Internet Presence Provider (IPP) services as they conduct a review of their current operations and plan for future requirements.  Please note NARA is seeking ASP services and not software development or programming services.  Service sought will be performed at the ASP’s site and not provided at a NARA site.
	Currently the Congressional Affairs and Communications Staff is responsible for maintaining the web sites in Table A.  The Internet sites and Intranet Sites are maintained in similar manners with development, test and three production servers (See Figures 1 and 2).  The Web Program staff performs development tasks on their desktop systems with the development server appearing as a local drive.  Updates and modifications are posted to the test and staging environment as required using FTP.  Items placed in the staging environment are automatically replicated to all of the Production servers within minutes.  On a weekly basis the Internet test server is overwritten from the production site. 
	Employees of the Federal Register post critical, time-sensitive information each business day to the Federal Register section of the Internet site, from a location other than that of the Web Program staff..
	Both the Intranet and Internet sites host NARA’s employee locator application.  The Internet locator is based upon a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script running against a text file to render search results in a browser window.  The Intranet uses a PHP scripted page running against a text file.  Each web site also provides a means to enter feedback to the appropriate staff member through a form mailer script.  The Intranet site provides the user the ability to view their local weather data on the fly from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric (NOAA) web site.  This information is pulled from the NOAA web server and written to the Intranet servers.  At this time NARA is not running a back-end database, but this will be a future expansion of functionality requiring OEM of development, test and production environments.  In the event of a site redesign, a development area must be provided that will be mirrored to production upon completion of the redesign effort.

Table A – NARA Maintained Web Sites

URL	Type	Description
www.archives.gov	Internet	NARA’s primary public web site consisting of approximately 12,000 documents
hoover.archives.gov	Internet	The web site of the Hoover Presidential Library consisting of approximately 700 documents
nixon.archives.gov	Internet	The official source for the historical materials created and received by the White House during the administration of President Richard M. Nixon (1969-1974).  Approximately 500 documents.
clinton1.nara.gov	Internet	Copies of each iteration of the Clinton Presidential web sites consisting of approx 103,000 documents.
clinton2.nara.gov	Internet	
clinton3.nara.gov	Internet	
clinton4.nara.gov	Internet	
clinton5.nara.gov 	Internet	
clinton6.nara.gov	Internet	
www.nara-at-work.gov	Intranet	Intranet Web Site for NARA Users Only.  Consists of approximately 10,000 documents

	In addition to the web sites in Table A, NARA also maintains sites hosted by third-party vendors.  These sites are listed in Table B.  NARA would like to consolidate these sites into a single hosting site in the future.

The archives.gov web site represents NARA’s main bandwidth consumer.  On a normal workday, usage averages .5 Gbps between the hours of 6 am and 5 pm.  However during peak periods such as the days immediately following a presidential election, bandwidth usage rises to levels as high as 5Gbps as users visit the Electoral College section of the site.


 
Table B – Third Party Maintained Web Sites

URL	Type	Description
www.ourdocuments.gov	Internet	A site featuring 100 milestone documents in American history along with a teachers guide and other related materials
1930census.archives.gov	Internet	A comprehensive guide to the 1930 census.

While the current systems work for the NARA requirements, NARA is seeking to establish a relationship with an ASP that will provide a managed hosting solution for web sites, tools and databases as well as up-to-date technology, and technical guidance in how they could better utilize today’s web-hosting technology and position themselves for future technologies.  

Software Applications:

	NARA currently utilizes a number of applications to support and maintain their web sites (See Table C).  While over the long term NARA is not committed to these applications, in the short term the applications functionality will need to be supported.  

Table C – NARA Site Support Applications

Application	Purpose	Description
Verity Ultraseek	Search engine.	Three instances are used to provide search indexes for the Presidential Libraries, Clinton Presidential Materials and the NARA Intranet site.
WebTrends	Monitor Site Activity	Provides statistical reports on site usage.
LinkScan	Link Checking	Provides weekly link checking, orphaned file identification and other error checking. 
Apache 4.3.10	Web Server	Web Server
PHP 4.310	Scripting Language	Open source Scripting Language.

Hardware:

	Currently, NARA is running dual-processor 280R Sun servers with the Solaris 9 operating system with a planned upgrade scheduled for FY 2006 to meet projected increases in visitor traffic.  NARA may turn these servers over to the ASP or migrate the web sites to the ASP owned hardware per best practices recommended by the ASP whether managed hosting, shared hosting or another solution.

Requirements:

In order to move the NARA hosted applications to a commercially managed hosting solution NARA requires an understanding of the ability of a commercial ASPs ability to support the NARA web sites described herein and provide the following support:

The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) uses graphic design services to create informational publications for public dissemination. The USITC is seeking the expertise of a professional design firm that can create an effective branding strategy for the agency’s communications materials to convey an updated and more uniformly recognizable image.  The branding strategy will be used in connection with the agency’s printed materials; it may ultimately be extended to electronic media, including the Internet.

USITC informational publications are often full-color with specialized binding and finishing. The newly designed agency branding strategy could be used in connection with a wide range of products including the annual report, information packet folders, pamphlets, brochures, and any other form of design and/or packaging of agency materials.

The USITC is soliciting comments from interested parties who would be able to provide information on all aspects of the branding process, including research, logo design, methods of increasing brand awareness and recognition, and the implementation and management of an effective branding strategy.

Please provide responses to the following questions and competitive pricing for these services.   


1.)	What types of research are typically undertaken by your design firm to develop branding concepts?  

	Please discuss your firm’s design philosophy, design process and work processes, including designer-client interactions.

2.)	The graphic design contractor should be familiar with pre-press and press inspection services related to printing publications using Government Printing Office procedures.  
	
	Please discuss your familiarity with print design.

3.)	The graphic design contractor must exhibit extensive knowledge of industry used graphic design and layout software programs such as: Quark, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Acrobat, etc. 

	Please discuss applications used in developing  your work product. 

4.)	The graphic design contractor will possess no less than five years of graphic design experience and must present a comprehensive portfolio of their most recent projects.  

	 Please provide a list of government agencies and/or commercial references for which you have provided graphic design services. 

This solicitation for information is extended to open market  vendors, but GSA Scheduled Vendors are preferred.  Your comments will be appreciated and considered as we create the Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the proposed task order.  

All work produced by the graphic designer contractor  for the USITC will become the property of the USITC. 

All responses to this RFI are on a voluntary basis.  The USITC will not distribute any payment or make any awards based on the response to this RFI.

All comments should be addressed to Jerome Williams in writing at ( email preferred: jerome.williams@usitc.gov), fax 202-205-2337, or by mail addressed: USITC, 500 E Street, SW., Attn Jerome Williams, Contracting Officer Room 414A, Washington, DC 20436

STATEMENT OF INTEREST

I.  Introduction

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Western Federal Lands Highway Division  (WFLHD), is researching the potential for purchasing or the need for development of a web-enabled review and comment system to improve its ability to communicate, track, coordinate and assure implementation of review comments for highway design and construction projects.  To that end, WFLHD is seeking to locate potential existing commercial software or capability for developing new software that will support simultaneous access, comments, and editing of one’s own comments via Internet and Intranet, real time file updates, and concurrent correspondence by a multidisciplinary, Cross Functional Team assigned to a given project for review at various design and construction phases.   

DESIGN PHASES

The WFLHD Office of Project Delivery employs a Cross Functional Team (CFT) review process extending across many functional disciplines and physical locations to develop project Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E), for advertisement and construction.  Projects are developed in several distinct phases, starting from reconnaissance, scoping, and progressing through location, preliminary, intermediate, plan-in-hand, final design, and final PS&E signoff to arrive at the finished engineering PS&E packet ready for advertisement.  Within each distinct design phase, simplified for this discussion, is a collaborative CFT effort.

First, CFT members investigate, analyze, and develop information relating to their functional discipline and submit recommendations to the Highway Engineer for inclusion into a draft PS&E package.  Second, the draft PS&E package is presented to the entire project CFT for review and comment.  This is a laborious task given that each CFT member is normally blind to the comments of other members under the current review process.  The Highway Engineer is responsible for organizing individual CFT member comments into a complete review document.  If opposing comments occur, the Highway Engineer must coordinate discussion among appropriate CFT members and facilitate resolution.  This comment collection, organization, resolution of opposing opinions and distillation to a final review document is repeated for each design phase of the project.  This second process is referred to as a “Peer Review.”  Resolutions to Peer Review comments are represented in the draft PS&E and become the final package for that particular design phase.  The collaborative Peer Review process and documentation of review comments, is the focus of this synopsis. 

Information on FLH is available at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/flh/index.htm. 

Information on the WFLHD is available online at http://www.wfl.fhwa.dot.gov.  

CONSTRUCTION PHASES

The WFLHD Construction branch employs Project Engineers (PE) to administer construction contracts and monitor contract performance.

After the final PSE is completed and the construction project is awarded the leadership of the CFT described above is passed on to the PE.  A critical role of the PE during construction is to communicate back to the CFT regarding progress, outstanding issues and “Lessons Learned.”  Construction feedback is a necessary and vital function to return information of what is working well and what is in need of attention in the earlier project development stage.

There are currently three vehicles from which the Project Development branch and CFT can receive feedback from Construction.  They are:
1.  The WFL Construction Feedback Form
2.  The WFL Construction QC/QA Mid and Post Construction Review process 
3.  Anecdotal delivery of construction feedback information.

All comments generated and received during the Construction phase should be captured through the Peer Review Process.  A full circle of comments would be available for a particular project in one location beginning with Project Development and ending with Post Construction Feedback.  This information would be used to identify “Lessons Learned” for subsequent project delivery PSE packages and construction contract administration.  It would also be beneficial to track initiatives, tasks or action items developed as a result of acting on received Construction Feedback.

<SUBJECT>Y -- SOLE SOURCE, PHASE II ROBINS AFB, MILITARY FAMILY HOUSING PRIVATIZATION
<DESC>The Air Force intends to negotiate with Hunt Building Corporation (WRAF Housing), on a sole source basis for the Phase II privatization of an additional 789 units (403 end-state units) of military family housing at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, in a Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction.  The transaction will not be funded directly with appropriated funds, but instead will be funded from tenant rental payments, including allotments from individual military service members’ monthly basic allowance for housing payments.  Such transactions require the developer to renovate, construct, maintain, repair, operate and manage for a period of approximately 50 years.  Estimated Transaction Closing: 1 September 2006.  THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE FOLLOW-ON TO A PRIOR COMPETITIVELY-AWARDED NON-FAR REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION with Hunt Building Corporation that privatized an initial quantity of 670 residential units at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia.  NO DATA/DRAWINGS AVAILABLE. The approximate solicitation issue date will be 16 January 2006.  Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2872 et seq.  Justification:  The agency has concluded that the follow-on real estate privatization functions required are uniquely available from only one source, because only the current privatization developer is able to satisfy the agency’s needs due to the units to be privatized being located well within the bounds of Robins AFB.  One project owner minimizes force protection security concerns.  An attempt to compete this requirement would result in substantial duplication of costs not recoverable through competition, unacceptable schedule delays in eliminating substandard housing, and the inability for any project owner other than the current project owner to rent to anyone other than military members.  This synopsis is issued for information only and is not a request for competitive proposals.  Developers interested in providing an offer, must be able to demonstrate in writing, by 15 November 2005, their capability to privatize the required units despite the lack of priority referrals and despite the lack of a waterfall that permits filling vacancies in core base areas with non-military tenants.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the agency not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the agency.  The agency will not pay for any information received.  A sole source, Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction RFP will be posted [www.pscmhc.com] on or about 16 Jan 06.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described real estate transaction contact with the incumbent developer listed. The point of contact for this real estate transaction and any submissions is Mr. Binks Franklin, Project Manager, PSC Military Housing Company, 132 South, 600 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84102; telephone: 703-568-8873, fax: 801-363-1912, e-mail: bfranklin@psc-evg.com.

This is a request for industry comments on a standardized pricing schedule.  

Although we will accept comments on errors such as incorrect formulas, our main purpose is to evaluate formats, ease of understanding and readability.  There are four Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs), 0001, 0002, 0003 and 0004.  Each CLIN has sub Contract Line Item Numbers (SLINs).   In addition to comments on format, understandability and readability, request your comments on whether SLINs are applicable to the services under which they are listed.

Request comments on the use of Non-Recurring Charges.  For measured rates, we have always considered the rates to be non-recurring.  Is this how industry treats those charges?

The BA SOW (Basic Agreement Statement of Work) is available at http://www-ext.tinker.af.mil/38eig/pk/pkk/Bizopps/bizopps.asp.  Please ignore references to the SS-SOW (Site Specific Statement of Work).  Also please note that the column E, Quantities, is not protected in order for you to test the spreadsheet.  In addition, this spreadsheet includes all possible services.  All sites will not have all services.  In actual use, it is our intention to delete any services which are not applicable to the instant site.  Therefore in actual use most pricing schedules will be significantly shorter than this spreadsheet. 

There is no solicitation available at this time and request for a solicitation will not receive a response.  Submit responses to Sam Cochran, 4001 Hilltop Road, Tinker AFB OK, 73145-2713, PH 405-734-9907 or e-mail sam.cochran@tinker.af.mil.     Responses are due no later than close of business on 23 Nov 2005.

<SUBJECT>89 -- Notice to Produce Industry
<DESC>NOTICE TO INDUSTRY

SUBJECT:  Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) Produce/Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Support Status with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia		

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) has been advised by a member of the Commissary Operating Board (COB) that the COB has recommended to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) that the Defense Commissary Agency be permitted to contract directly for produce support under their own cognizance. The final decision has been made by OSD. As a result, the DSCP is now operating under the guidance that the DSCP Subsistence Produce Division will no longer be supporting the commissary system with produce. The targeted effective date for fully transferring the produce support mission from DSCP to DeCA is October 1, 2006 or starting with Fiscal Year 2007. 

The specific milestones of the produce mission transfer have yet to be determined and are pending the results of planned inter-agency meetings between DeCA and DSCP personnel. Nonetheless, DSCP is forecasting future acquisition strategies with the expectation that DeCA will no longer be supported through the DSCP organization. This transfer of mission will not directly affect DSCP’s previous intentions to contract for produce prime vendors on a regional basis. The initiative to contract for produce prime vendors will continue with troop support, USDA school lunch program, Indian Reservation and other non-DeCA customers supported through the program. 

Please continue to refer to the DSCP Subsistence Produce Division web site at http://www.dscp.dla.mil/subs/produce/index.htm for current information regarding the produce prime vendor program.

<SUBJECT>B -- BIOACOUSTICAL WILDLIFE MONITORING
<DESC>The Bioacoustical Wildlife Monitoring Project for the San Dimas Technology and Development Center is located in Los Angeles County, California. The work will be performed at the Contractor/Vendor's place of business. The project consists of developing methods, technology, and software that would allow remote sensing of forest wildlife (especially birds) by the distinctive sounds that they produce.  Specifically, the USFS is interested in information in the following 3 areas: 1)  equipment that is capable of recording and storing digital sounds produced by wildlife in the field under a variety of weather and field conditions over a period of weeks, 2) technology and methods to allow for two-way wireless communication between the recorder in the field and a remote (office) location, and technology and methods to allow for the archival recordings from the field or a summary of the recorded sounds to be periodically (at least daily) relayed to a remote (office) location, and 3) software to automatically process the digitally recorded sounds produced by forest wildlife so that a reasonably accurate census of wildlife would be obtained. The purpose of this request is to solicit information from and gauge the interest of parties that might be interested in identifying technology that could perform the following 3 tasks in a cost-effective, field-practical, and reasonably accurate manner. Techniques, protocols and sampling design guidelines for using the equipment or technology are not desired. NAICS code:  541690   Size Standard $ 6.0 million.  The Request for Information is due by noon November 18, 2005.  Please check this site for the Statement of Need and additional information.

TELEPHONE OR FAX REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. ___________________________________ INTRODUCTION (a)  Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) recognized "wide variations in the quality and security of forms of identification used to gain access to secure Federal and other facilities where there is potential for terrorist attacks need to be eliminated."  HSPD-12 mandates a Government-wide standard for a 'secure and reliable' form of identification "that (a) is issued based on sound criteria for verifying an individual employee's identity; (b) is strongly resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist exploitation; (c) can be rapidly authenticated electronically; and (d) is issued only by providers whose reliability has been established by an official accreditation process".  The National Business Center (NBC) of the Department of the Interior (DOI) is establishing an officially accredited process for the issuance of "secure and reliable" Government identification and has been approved by OMB to offer this service to other Government agencies. (b)  The NBC has been designated as the provider of smartcards and smartcard services for DOI.  NBC, through DOI, has also been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to sponsor other agencies in becoming HSPD-12 / FIPS-201 compliant.  This would entail providing a turn-key solution for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) enrollment, card issuance and management, logical certificates, and smartcard middleware. (c)  To meet Federal requirements and the guidance and standards for sensitive systems provided by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), DOI, like all other Federal agencies, must provide new smart identity cards to all employees and contractors, all of whom will ultimately use those cards for physical access to buildings.  Eventually such cards will also be required to access certain sensitive DOI computer systems and data.  The use of the smart identity card cards is covered by the portion of HSPD-12 known as PIV-II.  Prior to that, however, Federal agencies must implement HSPD-12 PIV-I, which will require that new employees and contractors are properly identified so that no one can get a Government ID card by impersonating someone else. (d)  Background information for the Smart Card Program is contained in Section C.7 Required Standards. DEFINITIONS (a)  Interoperability - Refers to a system or a product that is capable of operating with another system or product directly without additional developmental effort by the user.  (b)  Logical Access Control - An automated system that controls an individual's ability to access one or more computer system resources such as a workstation, a network, an application, or a database. (c)  Physical Access Control - Refers to an automated system that controls an individual's ability to access a physical location such as a building, parking lot, office, or other designated physical space. (d)  Smart Card - Credit Size Card with an integrated circuit chip. SCOPE The contractor shall provide supplies and services necessary to support a common, interoperable, multi-application Smart Card solution.  The Smart ID Card contains information carried on the chip to be used commonly across applications.  In addition to supplying the card and accompanying applications, the Contractor may be called upon to provide Smart Card management services and Smart Card system integration to existing, or planned systems.  As specified in individual Task/Delivery Orders issued under this contract, Smart Card products and services are available to Federal agencies and organizations worldwide. GOVERNMENT INTEROPERABILITY  (a)  The Government Smart Card Framework will encompass a broad range of applications.  All Government Smart Card solutions must provide a common, interoperable set of services that supports physical and logical access control, biometrics, and cryptographic services. (b)  Interoperability will be achieved through use of the Government Smart Card Interoperability Specifications (GSC-IS v.2.1 and NIST SP 800-73) REQUIREMENTS At a minimum, the Contractor Shall:  (a)  Provide Cards - The Smart ID Cards shall be integrated circuit chip cards that may utilize multiple technologies and have varying capabilities. (1)  The card shall be FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified on both the contact and contactless modes of the chip (2)  The card shall be a dual-interface card with a minimum 64K of memory (3)  The card shall work with ActivCard v2.5 or later Applet (b)  Provide a Smart ID Card solution that shall support visual identification, physical access control and logical access control functions on a single card. (c) Provide Smart Card services and supplies that are capable of meeting FIPS PUB 140-2 Level 3, and that are compliant with the standards listed in Section C.7. (d) Provide a migration path to the PIV-II endpoint card as defined by the standards in Section C.7. (e) Provide Card Manufacturing, Issuance and Replacement (1)Card Manufacturing and Initialization  The Contractor shall provide the following capabilities: (i)  Loading the operating system into card memory; (ii)  Allocating memory zones on the chip; (iii)  Loading the unique card serial number into card memory. (iv)  Provide PIV II applet when available (NIST certified) (2)  Key Management (3)  Personalization The Contractor shall provide the following capabilities: (i)  Accept data from DOI SP/PIV system (ii)  Provide visual security features on cards compliant with FIPS-201 requirements (iii)  Print photo and personal data on card (iv)  Initialize card and load Activcard 2.5.1 or later applet (v)  Load personalized data to chip (vi)  Load photo and fingerprint to chip when standard is released (vii)  Return printed cards to DOI/NBC in Washington, DC (4)  Replacement The Contractor shall provide the capability to replace lost, stolen or malfunctioning cards.

<DESC>Opportunity for Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) For Testing of Advanced Controls Algorithms on the NREL/NWTC Control Advanced Research Turbine (CART)

Summary:  The Department of Energy/National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) solicits CRADA partners to collaborate in testing of advanced wind turbine controls algorithms for use on Utility Scale Wind Turbines.  The DOE’s goal is development of advanced controls algorithms that improve turbine performance (increase energy capture) and alleviate loads thereby reducing the overall Cost of Energy.

It is intended that tests under this CRADA will be conducted by the offeror at the National Wind Technology Center on the Controls Advanced Research Turbine (CART).  DOE/NREL intends to make available for this testing the CART facility, any necessary structural modeling and expert operational oversight.  For safety purposes all proposed algorithms must undergo aeroelastic modeling using existing FAST models of the CART turbine, before they can be tested on the turbine.  Facilities cost and support shall be born by the offeror as funds in to NREL.  The CART turbine is a 600 kW variable speed, two bladed, upwind, full span pitch controlled unit.  Variable speed is realized through a full range power electronics package capable of providing torque control to the generator.  Pitch regulation is realized through servo motors capable of Independent Blade Pitch Control.  The turbine has a full range of instrumentation, including; blade root bending, nacelle fore aft and side to side acceleration, tower based bending and wind inflow sensors at tower hub height and top and bottom of plane of rotation.  The wind season at the NWTC is primarily from the months of October through April, though some windy periods do occur during late spring and summer.  Due to limited resources, wind season and competing research activities, NREL will conduct no more than two CART CRADA tests per Fiscal Year.

The offeror must plan on being onsite during set up and testing of the controls algorithms. 

Dates:  Confidential CRADA proposal summaries, preferably one page or less, must be submitted to Mr. Neil Wikstrom by 4:00 PM, Mountain Time, November 11th, 2005, to take full advantage of this opportunity to leverage DOE resources.  CRADA proposal summaries submitted thereafter may be considered if a suitable CRADA Collaborator is not selected from among the timely responses.  Final negotiations of CRADA agreements and terms and conditions will be completed after initial discussions have concluded.

Supplementary Information:  Selection of an offering of collaboration will be solely at the discretion of laboratory management, based on interest in the testing, and laboratory assessment of the likelihood that the proposed collaboration will result in an effective controls algorithm for commercial wind turbines.  NREL is owned by the U.S. DOE and access to equipment and expenditure of all NREL funds are subject to the approval of the DOE. 

A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable collaborations between Government laboratories and industry partners.  It is not a grant, and is not a contract for procurement of goods/services.  The CRADA will result in no transfer of funds from the laboratory to the Collaborator.  The CRADA Collaborator will have an option to negotiate, in a field of use, the terms of an exclusive or nonexclusive commercialization license to subject inventions arising under the CRADA.  The CRADA will be funded by the industrial partner for the specific work described in the CRADA.  The CRADA partner will be responsible for all work to be performed by NREL. The expected duration of the proposed CRADA is no more than one year.  Access to the CART turbine and scheduling of testing will be dependent upon other program planned testing and other CRADA testing planned by NREL.  NREL shall be the sole arbiter of scheduling and scheduling conflicts.

CRADA Evaluation Criteria:  The following criteria shall be used by NREL in evaluating all submissions.
1.  The level to which the proposed partnership contributes to DOE technical goals and objectives as they relate to improvements in Utility Wind Turbine Cost of Energy (30%).
2.  The likelihood of achieving the technical goals of the specific project within the proposed time frame (20%).
3.  The background and technical expertise of the partner in the area of wind turbine machine design and advanced controls theory (30%).
4.  Ability of CRADA partner to commercialize potential inventions of the CRADA for U.S. economic benefit (20%).

The U.S. Army, Fort Carson, Colorado intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Ballistic edge for Sniper and Squad Designated Marksman training.

The training program is based upon new or optimized techniques that have been developed as a result of  independent research; to address the shortcomings in the current doctrine used by US military services. The proprietary techniques and information (copyrights pending) which are provided in the course are intended to increase the effectiveness of the snip er or SDM in the combat environment; by increasing the first round hit capability while decreasing the amount of time required to effectively engage targets, The new data collection methods in the course use inexpensive commercially available devices to sp eed collection of critical ballistics information, and minimize user error.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of  the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

HSAR 3052.209–70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b) (1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

You shall serve as a Vascular Technologist, providing care and services to inpatients and outpatients for the Vascular Surgery division in the General Surgery department located in the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, VA.

You shall normally provide services Monday through Friday between the hours of 0645 to 1800 (6:45am to 6:00pm).  The healthcare workers’ specific duty hours will be scheduled by the Director of Vascular Laboratory or his/her authorized representative and will vary based upon workload.  The healthcare workers’ shifts shall not exceed 10 hours and will include an uncompensated 30-minute meal break.  The healthcare workers shall not exceed 80 hours in a two-week period.

You shall not be required to provide services on the following 10 Federal holidays: New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King’s Birthday, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veteran’s Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  When required, to ensure completion of services that extend beyond the normal close of business, you shall remain on duty in excess of the scheduled shift.  You shall be given an equal amount of compensatory time to be scheduled upon mutual agreement of you and the Commanding Officer.  You shall arrive for each scheduled shift in a well-rested condition and shall have had at least six hours of rest from all other duties as a Vascular Technologist.

You shall accrue 10 hours of paid leave (i.e. vacation and sick leave) per 80 hours worked or in an approved leave status.  You shall be fully compensated for these periods of authorized leave.

Prior to performance of services, you shall submit to the technical liaison credentialing documents as required.  Your activities shall be subject to day-to-day supervision and control by Navy personnel in a manner comparable to the supervision and control exercised over Navy uniformed and civil service personnel engaged in comparable work.  The term “supervision and control” is defined as that process by which you receive technical guidance, direction and approval with regard to an element of work or a series of tasks within the requirements of this contract.  It is the intent of the parties that these personal service contracts create an employer-employee relationship between you and the Navy.  Accordingly, personal injury claims alleging negligence by you within the scope of your performance of this contract shall be processed as claims alleging negligence by DOD military or civil service employees.
