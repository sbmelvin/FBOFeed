<p>a. GENERAL Description:<br />The Pediatric Advanced Life Support provider course is offered by the Clinical Center four times each year and is open to all CC employees and medical staff.<br />The two-day provider course provides participants with the following:<br />&bull; Information needed to recognize and prevent cardiopulmonary arrest in at-risk infants and children.<br />&bull; Cognitive and psychomotor skills needed to resuscitate and stabilize infants and children in respiratory failure, shock or cardiopulmonary arrest.</p>
<p>The one-day recertification course provides the above benefits in a review format for those staff who have previously completed the full two-day course and also feel comfortable continuing to follow pediatric resuscitation protocols with minimal review.</p>
<p>The purpose of the course is to have Clinical Center employees and medical staff who are competent in providing emergency resuscitation to pediatric patients with acute life-threatening events. Pediatric Advanced Life Support providers include:</p>
<p>&bull; code response team members<br />&bull; staff in patient care areas and clinics</p>
<p>The course is taught in accordance with American Heart Association guidelines and enables participants to receive certification in Pediatric Advanced Life Support for two years. Reason for outside contractor:<br />This course cannot currently be provided at the NIH without an outside contractor for the following reasons:<br />&bull; The American Heart Association requires that the primary provider of the course provide the course to a number of students well in excess of the number of participants in PALS courses held at the NIH. Therefore, the NIH cannot be a primary provider of this course.</p>

<p>(2) Quality Control<br />&bull; The goal of the course is certification in Pediatric Advanced Life Support by the American Heart Association for each participant in the courses.<br />&bull; Participants are given both a written and scenario based test to assess their competency at the conclusion of the course. Successful completion of both tests leads to certification.<br />&bull; In addition, a survey of participants is included for feedback on quality of instruction and comfort level with material.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:</p>
<p>Period of Performance shall be for a base year of twelve (12) months from date of award with four (4) twelve month option periods.</p>

A modification to the order or contract may be needed before the invoice can be submitted and paid. <br />B. Shipping costs will be reimbursed only if authorized by the Contract/Purchase Order. If authorized, shipping costs must be itemized. Where shipping costs exceed $100, the invoice must be supported by a bill of lading or a paid carrier's receipt.</p>
