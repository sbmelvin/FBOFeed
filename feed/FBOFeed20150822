<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought

The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Charleston, WV that will be expiring. The Government requires office and related space yielding approximately 4,100 Net Usable Square Feet (NUSF) and 20 parking spaces.

The lease term requirement is for 5 years firm and 5 years non-firm. The space must be available for occupancy by April 1, 2016. The delineated area is: Within the city of Charleston, WV

Space must be on no more than one floor

Nine (9) offices
Reception area
Conference room
Larger group room
Storage room
File room
Copy room
IT closet (8x8 minimum)
Kitchen with sink, counter and space for refrigerator

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

COST <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION:  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army has a requirement for personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to maintain and provide functionality for the Base Realignment and Closure Financial Module (BRAC FM). The BRAC FM was developed to support the distribution of Base Realignment and Closure funds to Army Commands/Installations and the US Army Corps of Engineers.  The BRAC FM has an interface with the Funds Control System (FCS) managed by the Army Budget Office (ABO).  The current hardware and software configuration for the BRAC FM are as follows: <br>   <br> Application server operating system - Windows 2008 R2  Software - Internet Information Server; 7.5 Crystal Reports XI  Database Server - Windows 2008 R2 Software; SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard  <br>  <br> The Government seeks to update and maintain the BRAC FM System, except for those items specified as government furnished property and services.  It is the responsibility of successful offeror to be responsible for performing all operation and maintenance functions to support the BRAC FM.  The successful offeror will also enhance, maintain and update the BRAC public website.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p>(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC>The NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) has a signed, valid, and binding Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with The Independence Seaport Museum (ISM), which outlines the roles to further Educating Acquisition, Global Logistics, and Engineering (EAGLE) education in the Philadelphia area.

In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Philadelphia Office intends to solicit only The Independence Seaport Museum.

Market research was conducted which indicated only The Independence Seaport Museum (ISM) is able to implement the Educating Acquisition, Global Logistics, and Engineering (EAGLE) Program.
 

To engage with another educational intuition would be time consuming, would not support program requirements, and the infrastructure for such a program would be cost prohibitive. 

The Independence Seaport Museum has a proven track record and has demonstrated their ability to perform by engaging with the public through enrichment tours and historically based classes. ISM has the capacity to host students, provide qualified instructors, and is able to provide the necessary facilities to accommodate the learning process with the flexibility to execute the EAGLE curriculum on short notice.

This procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition as authorized under FAR 6.302-1.
 The resultant contract shall be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract. Only The Independence Seaport Museum may submit quotations to fulfill this requirement which shall be considered by the NAVSUP FLC Norfolk, Philadelphia Office.

For questions regarding this announcement, please contact Mr. James Jenrette, Code 280.3X, via telephone at 215-697-9590 or via e-mail at James.Jenrette1@navy.mil.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p>(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
