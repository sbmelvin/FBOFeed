<CONTACT>Timothy Costas, 202-385-8570
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a critical need for the modernization at four of its largest facilities.  Because of the critical need and schedule, the FAA is only seeking sources that currently have automation systems in use in the Terminal environment of the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) for the separation of aircraft.  The requirement is for the modernization of the Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS) model IIIE, Full Digital ARTS Display (FDAD) systems located at four Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities, and their associated air traffic control towers, located in Chicago, IL; Denver, CO; St. Louis, MO; and Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN.  The modernization must provide a scalable configuration to accommodate the redundant and diverse architectures found at each of the TRACONS and associated air traffic control towers, and  include color TRACON displays, tower displays, Local Area Network (100MB minimum), and improved processing speed. Again, only interested parties that currently have automation systems in use in the Terminal environment of the NAS must submit a system description of their automation systems that are used in the safe and efficient movement of air traffic.  If interested parties can not demonstrate  the required criteria (i.e. an automation system in use in the Terminal environment of the NAS) they will be eliminated from further consideration.  Expected contract award  NLT January 2007 or earlier, if practicable.  Interested parties must submit system description five (5) pages or less within ten (10) business days of issuance of this announcement to the following address: Federal Aviation Administration FOB10B, AJA-46, Attn: Tim Costas (Tim.Costas@FAA.Gov) TAMR Contracting Officer 600 Independence Avenue, S.W. 4th Floor, Section M Washington, D.C. 20591 Note - Please submit any questions via email request.

<RESPDATE>112805
<ARCHDATE>12282005
<CONTACT>Audrey Lucas, 202-385-8364
<DESC>En Route Program Operations has a requirement to provide maintenance and sustainment of the Host Interface Device (HID)/National Airspace System (NAS) Local Area Network (LAN) (HNL), as well as transition support to En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM).  HID, Network System Monitor (NSM), Router, Host/ATM Data Distribution System (HADDS) and Store and Forward Appliance (SAFA) are subsystems of the HNL and herein considered when referring to HNL. These subsystems provide Air Traffic data delivery/storage/conversion services to end user applications at FAA Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs). The FAA's ERAM Program will be subsuming the HID and NSM functions of HNL but will not include the data delivery, storage, and conversion services native to HADDS and SAFA. These systems must be updated to enable the HADDS and SAFA subsystems to operate with both the ERAM and the HCS/HID systems during the ERAM/HCS transition period. The HNL is an essential NAS element that must also be sustained for existing users.  HNL provides 24/7 service availability and requires second level operational and maintenance support functions. The HNL support task is currently under a Small and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) set-aside.  Continuation of this work without interruption is required to support integration with ERAM synchronization milestones in 2006.  The ERAM program is a critical element of NAS modernization and these efforts are critical to the success of the ERAM Program.  The FAA will review all information submitted by certified 8(a) socially & economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB's) and other small businesses that have a General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract to determine whether a SEDB(8(a)) or small business set-aside is appropriate.  Teaming is encouraged. However, the "Limitation on Subcontracting" clause shall apply." Interested parties must provide a completed Vendor Capabilities statement (contractor's format) and submit a Business Declaration Form (attached).   The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541330 and business size standard is  $4,000,000.  The FAA estimates that a minimum technical staff of eight  (8) people is required to support the HNL sustainment and transition task.  Respondents to this market survey must provide resumes of at least eight (8) technical staff exhibiting a minimum of 10 years FAA En Route operational systems experience and a minimum of three (3) years expertise in HNL development and sustainment activities.  Respondents must demonstrate the following capabilities, which will be used as a basis for evaluating responses to this market survey: Â· Experience providing HNL software/hardware technical support for the resolution of local or national system problems; Â· Experience with developing HNL maintenance, updates, and release of technical (hardware and software) modifications and documentation to field sites and WJHTC laboratories; Â· Experience with providing on-site support to Field Site maintenance personnel and WJHTC personnel during installation of HNL upgrades and testing activities; Â· Ability to determine causes and implement solutions for HNL system hardware and software malfunctions; Â· Ability to provide source code updates in the form of update files for PTR resolutions and other updates, as required; Â· Experience with performing configuration management of HNL hardware, software, adaptation data, configuration data, and documentation; Â· Knowledge of HNL connectivity to other Laboratories to support experimentation such as En Route Integration and End-to-End tests; Â· Knowledge of HNL clients/users at the Technical Center and operational field sites; Â· Ability to develop and implement hardware, software, and networking changes required to ensure seamless transition and fallback between HADDS/SAFA, ERAM/HCS, FTI connected clients, and locally connected clients; Â· Knowledge of Common Message Set (CMS) processing and skilled staff available to design and develop changes required to support HNL transition; Â· Knowledge of HADDS interfaces and skilled staff available to design and develop HADDS to ERAM interface software; Â· Knowledge of the SAFA interfaces and skilled staff available to design and develop SAFA to ERAM interface software; Â· Knowledge of the networking architecture for ERAM Air Traffic Management (ATM) Intermediate Point of Presence (IPOP); Â· Ability to integrate existing HNL security measures into ERAM ATM IPOP;  All responses to this announcement must be in writing, no more than 30 pages, and directed to Audrey Lucas by close of business Monday, November 28, 2005.  Responses may be sent to the attention of Ms. Lucas by e-mail at: audrey.lucas@faa.gov. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or costs incurred which are associated with any response received from this market survey.  Therefore, any costs associated with market survey submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to negotiate on a Sole Source basis.  The U.S. Government has an urgent need to acquire and maintain within the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) a Pediatric Formulation of Potassium Iodide for children under the age of 10 years who live within a 20 mile radius of commercial nuclear power reactors that are included in the States with Potassium Iodide Distribution Programs. Iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones are also essential to life having influence on development, growth, and metabolism. If radioactive iodine (radioiodine) enters the body, it will concentrate in the thyroid gland. Radioiodine exposure to the thyroid gland can lead to thyroid cancer or, if the radioactivity dose is large enough, destroy the thyroid gland. The population at highest risk for radioiodine exposure is children, due to the fact that children require thyroid hormone for normal growth and development. Following a nuclear detonation or reactor accident, several radioactive isotopes, including radioiodine, would be dispersed into the environment. One strategy developed to prevent incorporation of radioiodine into the thyroid gland is to saturate the thyroid gland with non-radioactive "stable" iodine so that if the thyroid is exposed to radioiodine, it will not take up radioiodine. The Government intends to enter into a sole source contract with the only currently known manufacturer of Potassium Iodide in a liquid formulation, Flemming and Company Pharmaceuticals of Fenton, Missouri.

<DESC>Conduct culture slide preparation and chromosome painting on blood samples of non-human primate.  The peripheral blood shall be cultured according to current methodology for lymphocytes of the rhesus monkey.  Culture of the blood shall occur within two (2) days of receipt of the blood. The chromosome (metaphase cells) shall be stained by appropriate chromosome painting methodology to reveal the presence of chromosome translocations or complex rearrangements.  The entire metaphase cell may not undergo painting due to the combination of probes used to paint the chromosomes.  It will be necessary for the successful contractor to determine the percentage of the genome that has been painted, determine what constitutes a cell equivalent, and analyze the appropriate number of cell equivalents per sample to insure that the equivalent of 50 metaphase cells are analyzed (lymphocyte culture per animal per time point) in order to provide sufficient numbers of cells for statistical analysis.   Up to thirty (30) samples will need to be analyzed at one time-point and there will be 2 to 5 time-points.  Selection criteria for awarding a contract will include: Documented Experience - (1) Experience in the successful application of chromosome painting methods to the detection of chromosome translocations in human and/or non-human primates; (2) The use of chromosome painting methods in the analysis of the effects of potential toxicants on the frequency of chromosome translocations.

SEACO possesses specialized experience and expertise as the provider of the original code used to interface with NSWCCD digital recording modules for the processing of data as well as providing the design of many existing instrumentation sensors currently in use. Award to other than SEACO would result in substantial duplication of government costs and resources to effectively train and familiarize new personnel in the area of sensor installation, selection, maintenance and hookup.

The following provisions and clauses apply:  52.213-4 {Incorporating 52.222-3, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.225-13, 52.233-3,  52.233-4, 252.204-7003, 52.232-1, 52.232-8, 52.232-11, 52.232-25, 52.233-1  252.243-7001, 52.253-1, 52.222-19, 52.222-20, 252.225-7001, 252.225-7002, 52.232-33, 52.204-7, 252.204-7004, 52.209-6, 52.211-5, 52.211-17, 52.243-1, 52.247-34, 52.211-14 (DO); 52.222-19; 52.252-2}.   NOTE: The following provisions with a "FILL-IN"  MUST BE COMPLETELY FILLED OUT and submitted with the offer:  52.222-22 [FILL-IN]; 52.222-25 [FILL-IN]. CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described!   in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!   for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or rev!  ised performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are  summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment!  , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. To be eligible for award you must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.  Lack of registration in the CCR shall make an offeror INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD. Past performance will be evaluated using the Navy's RED/YELLOW/GREEN program as follows: (A) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System, Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) program. RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of !  proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

<DESC>The NHLBI is seeking a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for a new six-year multi-center clinical trial, Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT). The Long-Term Oxygen Treatment Trial (LOTT) is a randomized controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of around-the-clock, supplemental oxygen therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and moderately severe hypoxemia.  This trial is needed to provide a scientific basis for decisions regarding the clinical use of long-term oxygen treatment. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve clinical management of COPD, with increased length and quality of life for patients with COPD. It is estimated that data will be collected from approximately 5,000 subjects and that it will include demographics, medical history, medications, results of clinical laboratory tests, and responses to questionnaires. Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled over a 30 month period at each of approximately 20 Regional Clinical Centers (RCCs) solicited under RFP NHLBI-HR-06-07.  Subjects will be followed for up to 42 months.  One or more substudies that enhance the scientific value of the parent trial will also be performed in this program.  Substudies may be conducted at all RCCs or at only a subset of the RCCs.  Substudies will be selected and designed by the Substudy Subcommittee of the Steering Committee. The DCC will: 1) provide biostatistical support for protocol development, including power and sample size calculations and simulations; for study monitoring; and for the analysis of study data; 2) administrative guidance, oversight, and support for the LOTT as a whole; promoting interactions among the RCCs and assuring uniformity of study activities at all sites; 3) make travel arrangements and reimbursement to the Steering Committee chair; 4) make travel arrangements and reimbursement to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) members; 4) coordinate, plan, make arrangements for, and participate in the meetings of the Steering Committee and its subcommittees and of the DSMB; 5) prepare and distribute minutes of the Steering Committee and DSMB meetings; 6) establish and maintain a computer system and software needed for the storage and analysis of study data; 7) develop and maintain a study web site for the distribution of LOTT information, documents, and forms to the RCCs, 8) develop and maintain a public web site that provides information about the LOTT for the lay public; 9) prepare and distribute periodic technical and statistical reports to the participating RCCs, the project officer, a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) representative and the contracting officer, 10) review, at least weekly, study plans, procedures, activities, and data to ensure the scientific validity and clinical relevance of the trial and the protection of human subject safety and privacy, and 11) monitor adverse event reports for patterns of safety or toxicity that may warrant changes in the study.  The DCC will frequently need to make quick decisions, often based on medical information obtained from the clinics.  Therefore, staff will need to possess strong medical and scientific qualifications and experience relating to COPD.  The DCC’s medical monitor should be board-certified in pulmonary medicine, have expertise in the clinical management of COPD, and experience in clinical research.  The DCC must have experience with complex multi-center trials, readily available pulmonary medical expertise, and the ability to analyze a large volume of physiologic, quality of life, medical morbidity and mortality data.  This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. It is anticipated that the RFPs will be available on or about November 25, 2005 at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and posted on FedBizOpps.   This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541710.

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 519190 and the business size standard is $6.0M.  

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Center for Standards and Certification (NCSCI) is mandated by the U.S. Congress to provide standards, standards-related information, technical regulations information, and conformity assessment information to any U.S. domestic or foreign individual or government agency with an information need.   To fulfill this mandate, NCSCI requires access to the widest, most comprehensive, and current active standards collection available.  Information Handling Services, Inc. is the only known source that possesses the combination of electronic format, scope and breadth of coverage to meet the following minimum specifications.

 Scientific and technical information internet services for bibliographic records must include the most current and comprehensive industry standards information issued by U.S. national, regional, and international standards-developing bodies.  Bibliographic ecords must include TIA, API, NEMA, and BSI standards documents.  

Scientific and technical information internet services must include the following capabilities:

- Simultaneous electronic search capability across the full set of standards to identify the relevant documents in answer to any inquiry.  

- Simultaneous electronic report generation capability across the full set of standards to capture and communicate search results on the relevant documents in answer to any inquiry.

•	Document number
•	Keywords from document titles and abstracts
•	Organization name or acronym	
•	ANSI Approved documents
•	DoD Adopted documents
•	Documents recently new or revised

The Government is unaware that any other source from which these services can be obtained.

The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NIST to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:30 EST, November 17, 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>DHHS-ORDC-05-01

<CONTACT>Rebecca  Guenthner, Contracting officer, Phone 301-496-3876, Fax 301-480-3695, Email rg45t@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to negotiate on a Sole Source basis.  The U.S. Government has an urgent need to acquire and maintain within the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) a Pediatric Formulation of Potassium Iodide for children under the age of 10 years who live within a 20 mile radius of commercial nuclear power reactors that are included in the States with Potassium Iodide Distribution Programs. Iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones are also essential to life having influence on development, growth, and metabolism. If radioactive iodine (radioiodine) enters the body, it will concentrate in the thyroid gland. Radioiodine exposure to the thyroid gland can lead to thyroid cancer or, if the radioactivity dose is large enough, destroy the thyroid gland. The population at highest risk for radioiodine exposure is children, due to the fact that children require thyroid hormone for normal growth and development. Following a nuclear detonation or reactor accident, several radioactive isotopes, including radioiodine, would be dispersed into the environment. One strategy developed to prevent incorporation of radioiodine into the thyroid gland is to saturate the thyroid gland with non-radioactive "stable" iodine so that if the thyroid is exposed to radioiodine, it will not take up radioiodine.

<ARCHDATE>01012007
<CONTACT>Marita Thompson, Deputy for Small Business, Phone 202-767-0666, Fax 202-767-0494, Email marita.thompson@nrl.navy.mil
<DESC>This announcement amends NRL-Wide BAA05-01 posted on Dec 30, 2004 by revising topic BAA 82-05-01 SPACECRAFT TECHNOLOGY to include a request for proposals for technologies to support the Spacecraft for the Universal Modification of Orbits (SUMO) Program.  The SUMO program consists of a front end that combines detailed relative pose estimation with a multi degree of freedom robotic manipulator system to autonomously grapple tumbling space objects without custom interfaces.  SUMO offers the potential for spacecraft salvage, repair, rescue, reposition, and debris removal. This capability can extend service life by providing a safe and calculated disposal after propellant exhaustion.
The further information on this topic as well as the complete BAA including proposal preparation instructions, technical points of contact for each topic, and evaluation criteria is available at http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/baa.htm

<DESC>FedBizOp Announcement 

Subject:  Common Database Specification for USSOCOM /Request for Information (RFI) Notice

The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Special Operation Forces Training Systems (PM STS) in partnership with US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is seeking industry information on a specification for mission preview, mission rehearsal, and simulation systems.  The Common Database (CDB) will be a non-proprietary, Government owned/controlled Specification.  The Common Database (CDB) is the foundation for a common architecture that will support commonality, interoperability and reuse by multiple mission preparation systems.  The concept was developed on the premise that correlated data layers would be produced using the best of breed Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) tools and saved in industry and/or national standard formats.   These data layers can then be compiled into the various run-time formats required to operate mission planning/preview and simulation sub-systems.  These sub-systems include 3-dimensional views of the mission or training area, semi-automated forces, simulated radars, simulated sensors, simulated/stimulated Night Vision goggles, and weather conditions.  These same data layers can also be shared within the Joint-simulation community.  

The intent of the CDB specification is to define: 
	(a)  Data content
	(b)  Representation
	(c)  Storage structure
	(d)  Access method   
The goal is to have the data logically organized in data sets which have mutually exclusive contents where: 
	(a) Each data set has its own distinct tools
	(b) No data is duplicated between data sets
	(c) No data is duplicated within a data set
	(d) Clients access unique data representations through data sets so as to ensure source level correlation.  
USSOCOM’s intent is to begin using the Common Database in the new simulation devices being produced under the ASTARS-04 contract and then to extend the use of CDB to all USSOCOM simulation systems.  The ASTARS-04 simulation sub-systems will simultaneously retrieve the CDB data in real-time to perform their respective runtime simulation tasks using real-time publishers.  For existing USSOCOM simulation systems, the CDB data layers will be compiled off-line and loaded into the simulation sub-systems until real-time publishers have been developed.    

The purpose of this RFI is to request comments from industry on the Common Database Specification in order to improve the Specification.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all constructive comments received from industry.  In addition, it is the Government’s intent to provide briefings on the draft Common Database Specification during I/ITSEC and to provide an opportunity for industry to ask questions.  Govt representatives will be available for discussion/questions on 30 November 2005 from 1300-1700 in Room 209B.   Responses to this RFI must be received by 10 January 2006.  

A copy of the Draft Common Database Specification is available on the PEO STRI Home page at the following address:  http://www.peostri.army.mil/ on or about 9 November 2005.  At our home page, select business opportunities from the menu bar in the left hand margin.  From the U.S. Army PEO STRI business opportunities module select PEO STRI Solicitations.  The document will be titled “Common Database for Real-time Simulation” contract N61339-01-D-0725/0003.

PEO STRI is neither negotiating nor calling for proposals.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any supplies or services, or for the Government to pay for the information received.  NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  Responses/comments should be directed to the Project Engineer, Ms. Rita Simons via email at rita.simons@peostri.army.mil or by telephone at (407) 384-3871.  Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged and should be in MS Word or Adobe PDF format.

<DESC>In February 2005, the Navy Aerial Target and Decoy Systems Program Office (PMA-208) of the Program Executive Office for Strike Weapons and Unmanned Aviation [PEO (W)], conducted a Request for Information (RFI).  The United States Navy has an emergent requirement for a cost-effective aerial target system to simulate a Subsonic Cruise/Supersonic Sprint Sea-Skimming Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Threat.  This Target System will be used to support current Fleet training of weapon systems as well as the test and evaluation of ship self-defense systems currently in development.  Examples of these programs in development include, but are not limited to, the SM-6, AEGIS, and DD (X) programs.  It is anticipated that the target program will enter System Development and Demonstration (SD&D) in early FY-07 timeframe.  Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is desired in late FY-10.  As a result, the program office is considering various acquisition strategies in order to meet the cost, schedule and performance requirements.  These strategies may include, but are not limited to: new development; modification of current target or missile systems; and conversion of surplus missiles in US inventory.  ///////  Subsequent to the original RFI the program requirements have been refined and the Navy has nearly completed writing the Capabilities Development Document in anticipation of submission for review in November 2005.  INFORMATION THAT MAY BE CRITICAL FOR INDUSTRY TO REFINE ITS CONCEPTS FOR THE THREAT-D TARGET SYSTEM HAS BEEN UPLOADED TO THE PMA-208 WEB SITE. [(Titled: THREAT-D Industry update.ppt) located at http://www.navair.navy.mil/pma208/; click on “Current Events”.]  ///////  The purpose of this posting is to request Industry review the Power Point presentation and the refined requirements and provide feedback to PMA-208 on the impact these additional requirements definitions have on the ability to viably compete and deliver a target vehicle to support operations in late FY10.  ///////  Industry comments and feedback to this Request will be analyzed, considered, and possibly used in the development of a potential Solicitation and/or Request for Proposal (RFP).  All responses shall be delivered via email to Ms. Jennifer Augustine, jennifer.augustine@navy.mil, and Mr. Joe Valenzuela, joseph.valenzuela@navy.mil, NO LATER THAN 1 DECEMBER 2005.  ///////  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION SOLICITED OR PROVIDED.  Questions or comments regarding this survey may be addressed to Jennifer Augustine at (301) 757-5896 (jennifer.augustine@navy.mil) or Mr. Joe Valenzuela at (301) 757-6115 (joseph.valenzuela@navy.mil).

It is believed that Roche Diagnostics is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements) because of the following: The equipment necessary to perform this testing (Cobas Amplicor Analyzer, Roche Cobas Taqman 48 and Magnapure JE379) has been purchased by the Government and is currently installed at the National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center.  No other manufacturer reagents for these tests (HCV PCR and HBV PCR) are produced for this equipment and therefore cannot be used on this equipment. This equipment purchased by the government is state of the art technology that allows for sensitive, specific, reliable and timely test results assisting with diagnosis, monitoring and research or hepatitis disease.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However all proposals received within 45 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22.

<ARCHDATE>02242006
<CONTACT>Technical POC’s: Mr. Brian Granger SPAWAR Systems Center -       San Diego, Code 2746  phone: (619) 553-5275 email: brian.j.granger@navy.mil Mr Richard Arrieta SPAWAR Systems Center –     San Diego, Code 2744  phone: (619) 553-1968 email: rich.arrieta@navy.mil Administration P
<DESC>HULSFEST ANNOUNCEMENT This is to announce that the U.S. Navy EOD program office and the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division will be hosting an advanced technology evaluation of unmanned maritime vehicles for ship hull inspection missions as part of a market research effort.   Purpose: The purpose of this event will be to evaluate the technical feasibility of candidate technologies in conducting underwater ship hull object inspection and localization missions in support of the Navy EOD Ship Hull Object Localization System (HULS) acquisition program. This marine environment offers a tremendous challenge to mechanized solutions due to generally poor acoustic propagation, and the intensely demanding navigation and control requirements placed upon any vehicle attempting to conduct a thorough ship hull search.  The Navy is interested in exploring new technologies, both organic and mechanized, to increase search efficiency, while minimizing risk to personnel and high value platforms.  This event will examine potential hull inspection technologies and aid in developing a final system Performance Specification to support future procurement of a HULS system.  It will also allow early industry involvement in a contemplated U.S. Navy procurement.  Participation in th!  is event will not ensure any contractual agreement with the government however; it will greatly aid the government in the development of a future EOD HULS.    Tentative Dates: 20-24 Feb 2006 - Setup/Rehearsals      		 27 Feb -03 Mar 2006 - Demonstrations  Location: SPAWAR Systems Center’s Bayside pier facilities, San Diego, CA Mission/Scenario/Key Performance Parameters:  The mission of the HULS system will be to relieve divers of the time-consuming search tasks and yield reliable maps with information on threat objects on areas of interest.  The system must also be capable of accurately returning to object locations for closer inspection/identification purposes, enabling operators to rule out objects of non-interest, and provide tactical information in terms of countering an ordnance threat.  It is desired that an unmanned maritime vehicle be able to autonomously maneuver near a ship’s hull and then conduct a complete scan of the vertical section of the hull down to the keel, and from bow to stern, to precisely map objects of interest.  While the vehicle conducts its mission, data will then be sent real-time or near real-time to a topside control unit.  Operators at the control unit will have the ability to view data to classify and identify any detected objects of interest.  Additionally, mission data should be recorded for later playback a!  nd analysis.  All mission data will be provided to the government to facilitate analysis. Key performance parameters of interest include:  1. Detection and classification of targets (probability of detection/classification, and false alarms);  2. Navigational accuracy (contact localization accuracy);  3. Hull search rate;  4. Reliability and 5. Vehicle portability (system must be easily and rapidly deployable from either a small boat or from a shore location near the ship).                   Ship Information: Demonstrations will be conducted on a 130 ft long, steel hull, twin screw Oceanographic research vessel moored next to concrete/wood/steel pier.  A flat bottom barge will also be available for workups and practice runs.  Notification of Interest: Request interested parties for this event provide Company/Organization Name, Personnel contact name(s), Address, Telephone Number, e-mail address, Technical brief of their candidate technology –no longer than 3 pages; no  later than 01 Dec 2005.  The technical brief shall describe the technology and must address the key performance parameters discussed above. Demonstration Process: It is the Government’s intent to allow all interested parties to conduct a demontration.  However, due to funding and time contraints, the Government reserves the right to limit the number of demonstrations.   The Government will schedule demonstrations based on the merits of the information provided in the technical briefs.   Planning Meeting: Approximately one to two months prior to the event, a coordination meeting will be held at Spawar System Center, San Diego to address questions, view demonstration facilities, and resolve any logistical issues.   Questions:  Any advance questions and/or comments pertaining to this event may be sent through the Technical POC’s.   Funding: The government does not intend to provide any funding to technology vendors to specifically support this event.

Release Date:  September 19, 2005
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
National Library of Medicine

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION -  Drug Interaction Checker for Consumers

This Request For Information (RFI)/Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  The purpose of this RFI/SS is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  NLM welcomes comments from all individuals on each or all of these questions.  The NLM does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NLM’s   use of such information.   Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the NLM’s evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this RFI/SS, the NLM may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  In the event a RFP will be issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519,541511 or 511210 may apply.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the NLM shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the NLM’s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. 

Request for Information: 

The NLM seeks input and comment on a drug interaction checker for users of its MedlinePlus consumer health web site.  MedlinePlus already provides information on individual drugs and classes of drugs, and users access these pages over 3 million times per month on average.  The pages include information on side effects and precautions but at this time, MedlinePlus has no section where a user can type in or select medications and receive information on possible interactions and their severity.

To aid in the design of a possible future solicitation, we ask that interested organizations submit comments on the following issues: 

1.  Do you have a commercially available drug interaction checker written for a consumer audience? If so, is the interaction checker available for viewing on any public web site?
2.  What measures do you use to calibrate the reading level of the information you are providing?
3.  If you have a drug interaction checker but it is not written for a consumer audience, would you consider adapting it for such an audience?
4.  How many substances are listed in the interaction checker? Does the interaction checker include prescription drugs? Over-the-counter drugs? Brand names? Generic names?
5.  Does the interaction checker also include information about interactions with nutrients, dietary supplements, alcohol, and herbals? If so, can users include or exclude results for these categories? 
6.  What is the source of the drug interaction checker? Do you develop it in-house or do you acquire the data from another organization?
7.  Who writes the information? What are the qualifications of the person(s) who does the writing? If the interaction checker is available for viewing on a public web site, are the contributors listed there?
8.  Does the interaction checker list the sources of information that are used in 
    a. general preparation of the interaction information?
    b. specific sources for information for each interaction?
9.  Does the interaction checker list the potential severity of interactions? If it does, on what basis is the severity rating based?
10.  Does the interaction checker include a description of symptoms associated with an interaction? 
11.  Does the interaction checker recommend any course of action or management of interactions? Does the information stipulate that it does not constitute medical advice and to consult a health professional?
12.  In what languages other than English is the interaction checker available?
13.  Can users enter multiple drugs? How do they enter them—type in names (if so, is a spellchecker available), pick from a list (if so, are multiple formulations available and are generics as well as brand names available)?
14.  Does the interaction checker allow a user to see all of the potential interactions of an individual drug?
15.  How is the information updated? How often is it updated?
16.  What are the provisions for emergency updating of content?
17.  How is content delivered technically? Do you provide an application program interface (API) for other organizations or do you provide data to other organizations that are then responsible for programming?
18.  Is the interaction checker integrated with any other drug information product? If so, please describe.
19.  Based on the current use of MedlinePlus drug pages, can you give us an estimate of what it would cost to license your interaction checker? NLM prefers flat fee licenses.
20.  Based on the description provided in this RFI, what NAICS code would the proposed drug interaction checker best qualify as? 

NLM welcomes responses from all individuals and organizations on each or all of these questions.  Responses should be limited to approximately one (1) page per question, and are due October 19, 2005.  


Sources Sought: 

Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 10 pages that details the ability to perform the aspects of the effort described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of your business organization, e.g., Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned Business, 8(a), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit hospital, or other nonprofit organization, in their response.  

Responses should be identified with NLM-RFI2006-01, and are due by October 19, 2005.  Please submit three (3) copies of your response to the attention of: Sally Boakye, Contract Specialist, The National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisition Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Bldg. 38A, Room B1N17, Bethesda, MD 20894. Facsimile responses sent to 301-402-0642 will also be accepted as long as they do not exceed 20 pages in length. E-mail responses, sent to sally.boakye@hhs.gov will also be accepted.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract.  The Center for  Domestic Preparedness is conducting an end-user functionality and efficacy assessment for emergency response in-suit communications equipment and is inviting manufacturers to identify commercial products available for this use.

The intent of the user assessment program will be to provide the emergency response community user feedback and evaluation of equipment based on utilization of each piece of equipment selected in scenarios that replicate, to the maximum extent possible, conditions that will be experienced in incident response.  The results of the assessment will not yield a determination of what product is best, nor shall the Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) endorse any product or manufacturer.
The types of in-suit communications equipment being assessed are ones that would be used by emergency responders while wearing both Levels A and C personal protective equipment (PPE) ensembles, and performing the necessary tasks in the Hot, Warm, and Cold Zones.

The assessment will be performed at the CDP by evaluators from the emergency response population, representative of all disciplines of agencies and jurisdictions across the US.  These evaluators will be actual users of the equipment in the field.  The evaluators will be presented with specific scenarios and tasks to be carried out using the equipment.  The scenarios will be tailored so that evaluated criteria can be objectively and subjectively assessed by each evaluator.  Some of the criteria could include:  capability, usability, affordability, deployability, and maintainability.

If you wish to identify your particular brand/product for potential assessment in this user evaluation program, please provide in electronic (MS Word) format, your company name, address, point of contact, telephone, fax and e-mail address and information on your equipment.  Additionally, please provide any information available such as ability to adapt accessory microphones/ear pieces to multiple radio brands and models, ability of radios to accept other manufacturers’ accessory microphones/ear pieces, adaptability of equipment to be used in hazardous environments while wearing OSHA recommended PPE, reliability, maintainability, durability, environmental limits and safety reports.

Do not send your piece of equipment.  Selected equipment will be purchased from distributors/suppliers as the equipment is selected for the assessment.

The Public Buildings Service currently has conducted several pilot call centers. These call centers at a minimum receive, track, dispatch facilities related service calls (i.e. too hot, too cold, light out, power out, etc.). Various operational models, use of technology, computer software and reporting capabilities are employed.

The primary emphasis is a national service call center function capable of receiving work requests from the customer, assigning and tracking a control number for each work request, routing calls to the proper service provider, updating work request status, and tracking work to completion with detailed reporting capabilities.

The call center will be the central point of contact for occupants of an existing inventory of approximately 1600 government owned facilities across the United States.  However, the system should have the capability to expand capacity in the future.  

Provide emergency contact capability via telephone, fax, or on-line 24-hours per day including contingency operations during crisis situations such as natural disaster or terrorist attack.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Regional Referral Hospital Patient Isolation Facility
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is requesting information regarding the need for an isolation facility for the use of Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), NIAID, NIH in Hamilton, MT.  RML is a state-of-the-art research facility with a mission to study infectious microbes that cause disease in humans and animals. Because of its long history and expertise in infectious disease research, RML is now poised to play a leading role in the effort to improve the nation’s biodefense plans. RML will expand its studies to help develop new diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments for diseases caused by the intentional release of pathogens into a civilian population.   In order for that research to be carried out, a new Integrated Research Facility, which will contain some high-level laboratories (BSL-4), is currently being constructed at the RML campus. The IRF is scheduled to be ready for operation in spring 2007.  Considering the nature of the infectious agents studied in BSL-4 laboratories, it has been deemed necessary to provide a patient isolation facility that will provide isolation capability for RML workers and visitors with known or potential exposure to, or illness from, work related to laboratory acquired diseases. Infectious control procedures within the patient isolation facility will minimize the potential for transmission of these communicable infectious diseases from infected patients to non-infected patients, hospital staff, Government officials and others.  The purpose of this Request for Information is to gather data regarding what is currently available in the Hamilton, Montana area that could satisfy the requirement. If there is nothing currently available that will satisfy the following requirements, we are requesting information regarding what resources would be necessary to create such a facility.   1.  The patient isolation facility shall be located within an accredited medical facility (herein referred to as the Regional Referral Hospital (RRH)). The RRH shall be located within 75 miles of Hamilton, Montana. 2.  The RRH shall make the isolation facility available for use by NIH/RML within eight (8) hours notice.  3. The RRH shall be able to safely provide the full range of standard in-patient care and services for RML staff confined within the patient isolation facility. These services shall include but are not limited to: supportive care with IV fluids, antibiotics, etc; oxygen and oxygen monitoring; vital signs monitoring; patient ventilation support; etc.  4. The RRH and patient isolation facility must comply with JHACO and CLIA standards.   The following list is not an all inclusive list of requirements; but it is meant to provide a clearer understanding of the requirement. Minimum Facility Design Requirements:  The isolation facility shall have the capacity to provide for four (4) adult patients, potentially both male and female;  It shall be designed with seamless surface preparations and constructed to facilitate topical disinfection of all surfaces;  The facility must have an anteroom. It shall connect to the patient care rooms and shall have independent bathroom and shower facilities; Rooms shall be outfitted with standard hospital equipment and be able to accommodate utilization of ICU support equipment. Minimum Mechanical and Electrical Requirements: The facility shall have a dedicated exhaust system that is capable of being isolated for decontamination and testing in place; When utilized as an isolation facility, the patient isolation rooms shall have a minimum of 12 total air changes per hour including at least two outside air changes per hour; Electrical requirements within the facility shall be identical to those in critical care patient care rooms. Infectious Control Requirements: The contractor shall implement infection control procedures within the isolation facility sufficient to contain and inactivate BSL-3 and BSL-4 agents. These procedures shall address selection and use of personal protective equipment, room surface decontamination, liquid and solid waste disposal, etc.  Staffing and Training Requirements: The RRH shall supply the medical personnel to provide patient isolation services in the facility; The contractor shall provide written staffing and training plans. Standard Operating Procedures:  The Contractor shall develop SOPs describing patient transport into and within the RRH; entry/exit procedures into and out of the patient isolation facility; patient management and care within the isolation facility; emergency procedures (e.g. loss of negative pressure, fire, etc);  infection control; and maintenance procedures.  This isolation facility will be utilized on an on-call basis (within 8 hours of request). The RRH may utilize the facility for other activities but once notification is received, it must be prepared to handle RML’s needs. Any information regarding the current availability of such a facility, or the plausibility of the creation of such a facility in the Hamilton, Montana area would be useful to our efforts.  Responses should include estimated costs for planning purposes.  Responses should be submitted to Michele DiNatale at dinatalem@niaid.nih.gov by December 5, 2005.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Long Composite Fibers of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) by Spinning
<DESC>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to assist in advancing and commercializing LANLs Carbon Nanotube (CNT) technologies.

Partnerships may take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/or commercial licenses. Commercial licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation. CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to the Lab.

Although their diameter is roughly one-ten-thousandth that of a human hair, carbon nanotubes are 100 times stronger than steel, more durable than diamonds and provide the highest thermal conductivity of any material.  In addition to uses in lightweight, high-strength applications, these new long metallic nanotubes also will enable new types of nanoscale electro-mechanical systems such as micro-electric motors, nanoscale diodes, and nanoconducting cable for wiring micro-electronic devices.

The challenge that has faced researchers since the discovery of carbon nanotubes by Japanese scientist Sumio Iijima in 1991 is handling such gossamer materials and spinning them into useful lengths. Individual CNTs presently made are generally very short (< 1 millimeter) and are therefore difficult or impossible to use in practical applications. LANLs technologies overcome this limitation by providing a means for making long composite fibers of CNTs by spinning such fibers from a supported array of CNTs.

<SUBJECT>A -- Global Positioning System (GPS) Modernized User Equipment (MUE) Notice of Post-RFP Release / Pre-Proposal Bidders’ Conference for the “Development Contract” - FA8807-05-R-0005
<DESC>A pre-bid/pre-proposal conference will be conducted at Aerospace Corporation, Bldg A8 (basement), El Segundo, CA 90245 on 29 November 2005 at 0800 - 1200 hours for the purpose of answering questions regarding the Modernized User Equipment (MUE) Receiver Card Development solicitation.  

This conference supports the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Global Positioning System (GPS) Modernized User Equipment (MUE) Receiver Card Development Program, RFP # FA8807-05-R-0005.  The conference will provide an opportunity for potential bidders to discuss the final RFP for the development contract [Post-PRDA activities] after it has been released.  The current schedule for release is prior to 15 November 2005.

System Description: The MUE Program is the user segment component of the GPS modernization effort.  The objective of the MUE Program is to develop two form factors of receiver cards incorporating Y-code/M-code/C/A-code (YMCA) receiving and processing capability and the Protection of Navigation (PRONAV) security architecture.  The MUE Receiver Program does not include any full-rate production activities.  It is anticipated that future specific MUE receiver card procurements will be conducted by platform managers for receiver cards to fulfill specific platform requirements or by the Services to meet Service-wide needs.  A Statement of Objectives (SOO) will be provided in the RFP package defining the Government’s objectives for the current effort for which proposals have been requested.   The two form factors that will be required are based on the current form factors for the Ground-Based GPS Receiver Application Module (GB - GRAM) and the GRAM – Standard Electronic Module-E (SEM-E).  These receiver cards will be specified in Technical and Security Requirements for the Global Positioning System (GPS) Receiver Application Module – MOD SEM-E (GRAM-S/M) and the Ground Based GPS Receiver Application Module – (GB-GRAM-M) which will also be provided in the solicitation.  Potential offerors must have the ability to process, maintain, and store collateral secret and special access required information.  

Scope of effort: The contract effort for the MUE Receiver Card Development is anticipated to have a duration of 9 months with a period of performance from March 2006 until December 2006.  Upon successful completion of PDR activities, an option for an additional 39 months to complete the development of the two receiver card form factors is also included.  This 39 month option includes delivery of each receiver card form factor (test articles) after 21 months and an additional 18 months of support to the Government during limited integration testing of the receiver cards (test articles).  There are three options for the delivery of additional test articles.  - one per receiver card form factor and one for only the Core Component of the receiver card – that may be exercised if more receiver cards are needed for testing or other research by platform program offices considering the use of the products from this effort.

This conference will be a general session for all the participants from 0800 – 1100 hours.  One-on-one sessions will not be provided.  The Government has set aside the time from 1100 to 1200 for classified discussions.

<CONTACT>Steve Paschke, Business Specialist, Phone 208-526-1113, Fax 208-526-0876, Email sdp@inel.gov
<DESC>The INL has developed a modular friction stir welding tool design. This design allows for a less expensive and more adaptable friction stir welding tool that employs easily replaceable and interchangeable components.

The design is made up of three key components: the shank, shoulder, and pin. Each component’s material is optimized for its particular function within a given welding situation. The tool’s components are constructed with a smaller amount of the expensive exotic materials usually found in friction stir welding tools. The design permits interchangeability among the key components which creates versatility and easily replaceable parts. These features enhance the tool’s useable life span as well as allow for long and short-term cost savings.

The INL is soliciting a written indication of interest from industry partners interested in funding a collaborative technology development project and/or entering into a license agreement for the purpose of developing and commercializing this technology.  

Interested parties should respond by December 9, 2005.  Interested parties should send a description of their company and their ability to commercialize this technology to the contact listed below.  Any questions or inquiries should be directed to the contact listed below.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background:
The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/Military) position was established to more effectively coordinate the activities of the Military Liaison Unit (MLU) of the Operations Division (OPS) of USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).  These activities include military liaison and coordination, Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) deployment, Response Management Team (RMT) participation and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or Explosive (CBRNE) disaster planning under Presidential Decision Directive 39/62.  The HAA/Military will serve within the OPS Division’s MLU and will function as the Division’s principal point of contact with the Department of Defense (DOD).

Introduction:
OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA’s capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

The Operations Division (OPS) consists of three teams; the Operations Support Team (OST), the Overseas Administration Team (OAT), and the Field Support Team (FST).

The OST provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue (SAR), Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, Consequence Management, overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and other sectors necessary to assure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

The OAT provides administrative services to OFDA’s field offices.  The OAT also manages the Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) program, which provides rapid, surge capacity staffing.

The FST coordinates surge capacity staffing mechanisms, manages an inter-agency agreement with the US Forest Service for surge capacity staffing and OFDA response system design, maintains and trains on disaster response systems such as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) and the Response Management Team (RMT), coordinates with other agencies in the USG and with some elements of the UN, and coordinates the Public Donations Information and Outreach project.

OBJECTIVE:
The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military will provide the critical liaison function between USAID and the DoD military establishment in order to represent the humanitarian sector perspective and expertise in situations where coordination between the parties is required.

STATEMENT OF WORK:
The OFDA Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational and technical support for disaster responses.  The OPS Division identifies sources for procurement of relief supplies and manages the stockpiling and transportation of those supplies.  The Division maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams and the Office’s capability for deploying Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Response Management Teams (RMTs) in Washington.  The Division develops and maintains OFDA’s relationships with DOD, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Energy (DOE).

The HAA/Military will be assigned to the OPS MLU in Washington, D.C. for an initial period of 2 years.  Travel is required to attend DOD conferences, exercises and other related activities on behalf of USAID, OFDA, a particular DART or RMT and/or a CBRNE planning exercise as directed by the OFDA/OPS Division Chief through the MLU Leader.

• Supporting OFDA management in defining a strategy for military coordination which will include guidelines for determining OFDA participation in DOD operations when specific requests are made and where OFDA should request activities and participation;
• Determining whether OFDA participation in DOD humanitarian activities is necessary and useful;
• Providing OFDA briefings and training to uniform military officers at various DOD educational institutions (War Colleges, National Defense University, Navy Postgraduate School, etc.);
• Coordinating with DOD and the Department of State’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs to provide OFDA staff with briefings on military procedures, assets, roles, capabilities, culture, chain-of-command and humanitarian-related activities and circulate status reports which summarize DOD activities in which OFDA personnel are involved;
• Deploying with DOD forces in humanitarian emergencies;
• Providing reports, debriefs and evaluations to the OPS Division Chief and other appropriate OFDA staff of all planning, exercises and deployments;
• Assisting in the identification of OFDA’s Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division deployment needs in designated "at risk" countries where DARTs may deploy and work with other teams within OFDA to determine appropriate DART needs as a basis for contingency planning for personnel and resources;
• Availability for deployment to the field as a DART member;
• Assisting the MLU in providing classified U.S. Government (USG) information support to OFDA as requested and to selected DARTs and RMTs on an as-needed basis;
• Assisting regional Combatant Commanders (COCOMs)  in developing the humanitarian assistance aspect of their strategic operations and crisis action planning products; and
• Liaison with the DOD and other elements of the USG in an effort to help the military coordinate with the humanitarian community.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The incumbent will take direction from and report to the OPS MLU Leader in Washington, DC.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background:
The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/Military) position was established to more effectively coordinate the activities of the Military Liaison Unit (MLU) of the Operations Division (OPS) of USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).  These activities include military liaison and coordination, Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) deployment, Response Management Team (RMT) participation and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or Explosive (CBRNE) disaster planning under Presidential Decision Directive 39/62.  The HAA/Military will serve within the OPS Division’s MLU and will function as the Division’s principal point of contact with the Department of Defense (DOD).

Introduction:
OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA’s capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

The Operations Division (OPS) consists of three teams; the Operations Support Team (OST), the Overseas Administration Team (OAT), and the Field Support Team (FST).

The OST provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue (SAR), Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, Consequence Management, overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and other sectors necessary to assure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

The OAT provides administrative services to OFDA’s field offices.  The OAT also manages the Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) program, which provides rapid, surge capacity staffing.

The FST coordinates surge capacity staffing mechanisms, manages an inter-agency agreement with the US Forest Service for surge capacity staffing and OFDA response system design, maintains and trains on disaster response systems such as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) and the Response Management Team (RMT), coordinates with other agencies in the USG and with some elements of the UN, and coordinates the Public Donations Information and Outreach project.

OBJECTIVE:
The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military will provide the critical liaison function between USAID and the DoD military establishment in order to represent the humanitarian sector perspective and expertise in situations where coordination between the parties is required.

STATEMENT OF WORK:
The OFDA Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational and technical support for disaster responses.  The OPS Division identifies sources for procurement of relief supplies and manages the stockpiling and transportation of those supplies.  The Division maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams and the Office’s capability for deploying Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Response Management Teams (RMTs) in Washington.  The Division develops and maintains OFDA’s relationships with DOD, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Energy (DOE).

The HAA/Military will be assigned to the OPS MLU in Washington, D.C. for an initial period of 2 years.  Travel is required to attend DOD conferences, exercises and other related activities on behalf of USAID, OFDA, a particular DART or RMT and/or a CBRNE planning exercise as directed by the OFDA/OPS Division Chief through the MLU Leader.

• Representing OFDA in DOD conferences in the context of priorities set forth by the OPS Division Chief.  To strike a balance with lower level exercises and their operational impact, the incumbent will also place emphasis on participation in After-action Reviews (AARs), humanitarian exercises sponsored at the Combatant Command level and at operational level and strategic planning exercises normally conducted through Pentagon auspices to interact with policy makers;
• Supporting OFDA management in defining a strategy for military coordination which will include guidelines for determining OFDA participation in DOD operations when specific requests are made and where OFDA should request activities and participation;
• Determining whether OFDA participation in DOD humanitarian activities is necessary and useful;
• Providing OFDA briefings and training to uniform military officers at various DOD educational institutions (War Colleges, National Defense University, Navy Postgraduate School, etc.);
• Coordinating with DOD and the Department of State’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs to provide OFDA staff with briefings on military procedures, assets, roles, capabilities, culture, chain-of-command and humanitarian-related activities and circulate status reports which summarize DOD activities in which OFDA personnel are involved;
• Deploying with DOD forces in humanitarian emergencies;
• Providing reports, debriefs and evaluations to the OPS Division Chief and other appropriate OFDA staff of all planning, exercises and deployments;
• Assisting in the identification of OFDA’s Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division deployment needs in designated "at risk" countries where DARTs may deploy and work with other teams within OFDA to determine appropriate DART needs as a basis for contingency planning for personnel and resources;
• Availability for deployment to the field as a DART member;
• Assisting the MLU in providing classified U.S. Government (USG) information support to OFDA as requested and to selected DARTs and RMTs on an as-needed basis;
• Assisting regional Combatant Commanders (COCOMs)  in developing the humanitarian assistance aspect of their strategic operations and crisis action planning products; and
• Liaison with the DOD and other elements of the USG in an effort to help the military coordinate with the humanitarian community.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The incumbent will take direction from and report to the OPS MLU Leader in Washington, DC.
