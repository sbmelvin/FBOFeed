<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT- <br />The 142nd Contracting Office at the Portland Air National Guard, under the United States Property and Fiscal Office for Oregon (USPFO for Oregon), intends to solicit and award a sole source contract to United Bat &amp; Bird Control, LLC, DUNS: 07594-2222, CAGE Code: 1YTR6 for providing the Oregon Air National Guard's (ORANG) with bird netting hardware replacement and repair. The aircraft sunshade shelters currently have Bird Barrier Heavy Duty black netting and the in-place hardware is deteriorating due to environmental corrosion, thus creating a Foreign Object Damage (FOD) hazard.&nbsp; The requirement is to remove corroded hardware clips and replace with an upgraded non-corrosive type hardware, then re-stitch the bird netting in-place.</p>
<p>The existing bird mitigation netting was installed for the aircraft sunshade project in 2014 and is currently under a ten-year manufacture warranty and installation warranty by the installer, United Bird and Bat, LLC.&nbsp; The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under a previous contract.&nbsp; Because of the previous contract warranty, the contracting officer does not have a reasonable expectation that offers would be received from two or more WOSB concerns. No other business is willing to assume, accept, continue, or honor the existing warranty.&nbsp; Due to industry practices and to maintain the existing warranty, the corroded hardware must be replaced by the original installer, United Bird and Bat, LLC.&nbsp; Therefore, the requirement will be solicited and awarded directly to United Bird and Bat, LLC.</p>
<p>Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids, quotes, or proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561710 and the Small Business size standard is $11 Million. This will be a firm fixed price contract.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice.

This synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, however all responsible sources that believe they can meet all of the requirements may contact the Contracting Office via e-mail at michael.t.kitchell2.mil@mail.mil and be considered by the government.
