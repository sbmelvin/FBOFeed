<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the Center for Biological Research (CBER) requirement for Custom Fabricated Resequencing Microarrays.
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability and capability of Small Business Manufacturers or Small Businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotation, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. <br /><br />The appropriate NAICS code for this acquisition is 334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />Statement of Work (SOW)<br /><br />CBER Office of Blood Research and Review (OBRR) requires custom manufactured microarrays built to OBRR design for resequencing the Ebola virus genome. OBRR will be&nbsp;initiating a project to assemble a microarray system to evaluate the drift in genomic sequence of the Ebola virus genome. The system will employ the microarrays as the essential component. "Resequencing" is the activity of determining the DNA sequence of a targeted region of a pathogen genome by binding it to a specialized oligonucleotide microarray after amplifying the target from sample material such as blood, plasma or tissue. The microarray that has the capability to perform resequencing must be uniquely manufactured.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements<br />&#9679;CBER requires a high-density probe array with information densities as high as 10 to the power 6 probes per square centimeter in order to assemble a resequencing microarray.<br />&#9679;Photolithography manufacturing technology is necessary to achieve these high probe densities, produce consistent reproduction of the array design and reduce variation inherent in probe spotting technologies. To accomplish sequence reading from the microarray hybridization, adjacent probe locations shall have very consistent probe representation.<br />&#9679;The microarray shall be enclosed in a fixed volume reaction chamber, to provide for automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. The cartridge housing the microarray shall fit into the GeneChip Fluidic Station Model 450- Serial Number 60102270, GeneChipHybridization Oven Model GCHO- Serial Number 50205140, and GeneChip Scanner Model GCS3000,-Serial Number GCS50205140 as well as the instrument control workstation package software manufactured by Affymetrix, GeneChip Command Console (software for operation of the fluidic stations, and scanner) and GeneChip Sequence Analysis Software (GSEQ) software for interpretation of the DNA re-sequencing microarray<br />&#9679;The custom fabricated resequencing array shall provide approximately 120,000 bases of double stranded sequence information on a single array when used with properly prepared DNA and RNA samples.<br />&#9679;The custom fabricated resequencing array shall detect both known and novel single base changes by tiling probes that interrogate each base position with 8 unique probes representing all possible nucleotides of both strands of DNA.<br />&#9679;The manufacturer shall have available on-site service and support for use of the microarrays.</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />Ninety (90) calendar days after contract award.<br /><br />Place of Delivery:<br />White Oak Campus<br />FDA/CBER<br />10903 New Hampshire Avenue<br />Building 52/72<br />Silver Spring, MD 20903<br /><br />The respondent to this source sough shall furnish sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine its capability to provide products/services and components meeting the technical requirements identified above.

<DESC><br />NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order to the American College of Radiology, 1891 Preston White Drive, Reston, VA 20191-5431. The sole source award will be made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 235 ( c )(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies and Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. A Justification and approval is currently being processed for this requirement. This requirement is intended as a sole source procurement because the American College of Radiology's Lung Cancer Screening Registry (LCSR) is the only non-governmental entity currently qualified to meet CMS' requirements for purchase of information required for determining whether lung cancer screenings with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) furnished to Medicare beneficiaries are in compliance with the coverage criteria in the National Coverage Determination (NCD) that are not evidenced on the health care claim.</p>
<p>CMS REQUIREMENTS: This procurement will be for the purchase of lung cancer LDCT screening data from the LCSR. CMS will use the data elements linked to patient level claims data to document compliance with the coverage criteria in the NCD that are not evidenced on the health care claim.</p>
<p>NAICS CODE: The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 611699 (Educational Support Services) and the size standard is $6.0 million dollars.</p>
<p>INTERESTED PARTIES: All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. To be considered, interested vendors must submit technical literature describing their capability to effectively satisfy this requirement, as well as terms and conditions and a complete price quote within 15 days of this notice, to the following electronic mail address: phillip.harrell@cms.hhs.gov.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This notice is not a Request for Proposals or a Solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. This notice is not a commitment from the Government. The Government will not reimburse any bid or proposal costs as a result of this notice. No solicitation exists and requests for a copy of the solicitation will be disregarded. However, any future solicitation that will be open to competition will be subsequently issued on FedBizOpps in order to permit firms to respond.</p>
