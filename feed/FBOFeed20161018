<DESC>Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Training Aircraft Division, intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for up to fifty (50) months of Post Production Sustaining Engineering and Program Management (SEPM) services to Beechcraft Defense Company (BDC), LLC, 201 S. Greenwich, Wichita, KS 67207-1402. Market research was conducted and it has been determined this effort is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Post Production SEPM contract will provide program management and engineering services to support the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) fleet of 744 T-6 A/B/D aircraft at nine (9) locations for up to fifty (50) months. The JPATS users include United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), and United States Army (USA) and foreign customers participating in JPATS Foreign Military Sales (FMS). SEPM services include but are not limited to: systems engineering support, program management support, integrated logistics support, field service representative support, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Sources (DMSMS) management, study and analysis of aircraft deficiencies, as needed operation of a depot-level aircraft modification line, contractor field team activities, aircraft crash damage repair, individual aircraft tracking, aircraft structural integrity and engine structural integrity efforts, configuration and data management, technical manual updates, and design, development, testing, and supplemental military or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification of engineering changes necessary to correct component deficiencies or to introduce product enhancements into the aircraft fleets via retrofit. The contractor will also provide required FAA serviceability documentation and management of Government Furnished Property (GFP) supplied during the performance of this contract.<br /><br />BDC, as the OEM, provides highly specialized support as they own the T-6 engineering data and drawings. BDC designed and developed the T-6 platform and is the only source for all historical and current proprietary data, such as: developmental design and approval data, prototype data, and qualification and test data. These data are required to perform the sustaining engineering function for the T-6 program including damage assessment, occasional prototype of the repair, and development of repair instructions, when the extent of damage is unknown and/or needed repairs are non-standard. As ascertained through market research, other companies did not define a methodology that allowed them to obtain/recreate the engineering data necessary to support the program. The breadth of these data would include engineering drawings, stress analyses, durability and damage tolerance analysis, thermal and electrical margins, or other required documentation. BDC's refusal to sell/lease data combined with other sources lack of mitigation strategies to obtain the technical data required to perform the specifications contained herein would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs.<br /><br />Additionally, BDC owns the FAA type certificate on the T-6 aircraft. Their responsibilities as the type certificate owner include supporting the aircraft in the field by supplying parts and engineering services. The T-6 Program Office must have a relationship with BDC based on continued operation of the fleet. If someone other than BDC was to attempt to perform SEPM services that organization would need to have access to BDC data for repairs outside of the Structural Repair Manual, ADs, SBs, etc.<br /><br />A sole source award for more than one year is required to ensure there is no interruption in critical sustaining engineering services and program management support. If support services are interrupted, there will be a break in the training pipeline of pilots for the USAF and USN, severely impacting the ability of those services to provide required trained pilots into the mobility and combat aircraft pilot training pipelines. USA test and evaluation activities would be equally impacted if engineering services necessary to keep the T-6D aircraft in the air were suddenly removed.<br /><br />This is a notice of intent, not a solicitation. Responsible sources, however, may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Air Force if received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the posting of this notice. Any respondent is to specify in its response whether it is a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service disabled veteran-owned small business.<br /><br />Respondents should also specify whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. Any responses will be considered by this office before a final decision is made to solicit and negotiate with only one source in accordance with FAR 6.3012-1. "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Government is not responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this action is based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br /><br />Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Negotiator, Sara Gebhard, at (937) 904-4247 or email: <a href="mailto:sara.gebhard@us.af.mil">sara.gebhard@us.af.mil</a> or the Contracting Officer, Joseph Fountain at (937) 904-4609 or email: <a href="mailto:joseph.fountain@us.af.mil">joseph.fountain@us.af.mil</a>.<br /><span style="BACKGROUND: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow"><br /></span>Ms. Jill Willingham-Allen, AFLCMC/AQP, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (15) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(a) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required shall be obtained through the use of competitive procedures.
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 90 days after the issuance of this notice.
20.   Buyer name, phone#, and email address   Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer William J. Stephenson, 405-739-9077, william.stephenson.4@us.af.mil.

<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b) (1) - only one source reasonably available.</p>

This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Thermo Electron North America. Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Ms. Alma C. Barber via email to vel3@cdc.gov using solicitation number 2016-Q-65884 in the subject line, no later than 4:00pm EDT, August 25, 2016.</p>

In order to facilitate offeror's determination of contract capabilities, the following clarification is provided for the types of service requested:<br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />SCOPE<br /></span></strong>The 125th Special Tactics Squadron (STS) is required to be capable of rapidly planning, coordinating and executing a broad array of special operations missions. The 125th STS requires contracted support to provide assistance and expertise in order to aid in the development and enhancement of unit Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) relating to mission planning and Small Unit Tactics (SMUT). This training directly enhances 125th STS's ability to support of United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) overseas operations. The objective of this training schedule is to provide training for 12-18 personnel. Additionally, future iterations will continue to drive the development of 125th STS Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), which will align with SOP development of other active duty Special Tactics Squadrons. It is required that contracted instructors be familiar with the 24th STS Close Quarters Battle (CQB) SOPs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As an operational component providing personnel to various Special Operations Forces (SOF), the 125th<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>STS requires outsourced training in order to meet its training requirements. The contractor will provide expert instruction in all aspects of assault principles; ensuring each ST operator is proficient in the core skills relevant to missions executed by the SOF units that Special Tactics partner with. As directed by the 720th Special Tactics Group (STG), course graduates will be expertly proficient in individual/team advanced handgun/carbine tactics prior to deployment. CQB fundamentals will focus on Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) currently in use by the 724th STG and be applicable/adaptable to those in use by our partnered SOF units. Having instructors that have worked with and trained the 724th STG, is absolutely critical. ST as an organization is currently in the process of reorganizing so that our organizational structure mirrors that of the 724th STG and other Special Mission Units. Because the 724th STG has already developed TTPs, we want to fall under those procedures instead of attempting to invent our own. This is particularly important because Airmen from the 720th STG can be ordered to augment and support missions with the 724th STG and need to be able to integrate seamlessly. Additionally, advanced mission planning instruction and case studies with lessons learned will provide team members the skills necessary for any successful operation whether they are a part of a Special Tactics Team (STT) or a fielded Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC). ST Airmen may be required to use various charges to breach locked or barricaded entryways. Baseline training utilizing modern mechanical and explosive breaching techniques/procedures will be provided and included in varying scenarios. Following all training, instructors will provide a dynamic and realistic Full Mission Profile (FMP) scenario in order for the team to apply the skills learned and honed throughout the previous training days. Training shall be between 9-10 total days with up to 18 students provided for. Ensuring optimal instruction and safety concerns are mitigated, an appropriate instructor to student ratio of 1 to 10 will be upheld.<br /><br />Notes:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a pre-solicitation. Please contact the Contracting office so we may submit to you the full solicitation package. Upon close of this pre-solicitation (15 days), the solicitation period will end on or around 1 December 2016 (30 days), and the award will take place on or before 3 December 2016 to the 'best value' proposal that meets the Government's requirement.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Leica Microsystems, Inc., 1700 Leider Lane, Buffalo Grove, IL, 60089-6622, to procure a an upgrade for the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics' Leica TCS SP8 MP Microscope which is required for 4-Channel HyD NDD detection.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The major goal of the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics is a better understanding of the complex physiology of the cardiovascular system. Towards this goal, the Laboratory specializes in the use of non-invasive technologies to follow physiological processes in man and model systems. The laboratory is composed of four major sections: Cardiovascular MRI, Imaging Physics, Integrative Physiology, and Medical Imaging. The laboratory also has a very active clinical program evaluating the use of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure an upgrade for the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics' Leica TCS SP8 MP Microscope. This upgrade will give the laboratory increased imaging capabilities and allow for 4-Channel HyD NDD detection.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command plans to issue an unrestricted solicitation (N00024-17-R-2207) for the Detail Design and Construction of up to eight Towing, Salvage, and Rescue (T-ATS) Ships. The Government anticipates a single award contract with a base quantity of one and options for an additional seven ships over the life of the contract. The T-ATS will operate as the primary open ocean towing vessel for the U. S. Navy, and will have salvage operations and submarine rescue mission support capabilities. The T-ATS will be based on existing commercial towing offshore vessel designs which provide similar capabilities to those needed for U.S. Navy operations.<br /><br />The Government intends to acquire state-of-the-art commercially-available American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) classed vessels capable of performing the following missions:<br />&nbsp; &bull; Towing<br />&nbsp; &bull; Deep ocean search and recovery<br />&nbsp; &bull; Mobile diving and salvage unit-embarked operations<br />&nbsp; &bull; Submarine rescue vessel of opportunity<br />&nbsp; &bull; Oil spill response<br />&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;Humanitarian assistance<br /><br />Potential sources will be required to base their T-ATS designs on a mature commercial <br />vessel parent design which has been previously constructed or is currently being constructed. The commercial vessel parent design must have a dynamic positioning system meeting at least American Bureau of Shipping DPS-2 requirements. The commercial vessel parent design must have a minimum bollard pull rating of 130 short tons. The commercial vessel parent design must have a working deck area of 5,000 square feet with a minimum 131 feet in length by a minimum of 36 feet in width; this working deck area may include the area provided by a stern roller and can be met by re-arranging working deck equipment, but the working deck requirement cannot be met by modification of the hull form (e.g. plugging or widening the design's molded lines). Potential sources must have the design capabilities, production facilities, and management necessary to design and construct the vessels. Potential sources must either own or have access to a Navy certified dock or a commercially certified drydock prior to contract award.
<p>The Government intends to acquire the T-ATS vessels through a Full and Open competition utilizing a solicitation for the acquisition of a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The planned date for Request for Proposal (RFP) release is the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2017, with a planned date of contract award by the end of the 4th Quarter Fiscal Year 2017.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for the T-ATS procurement will be 336611 (Ship Building and Repair). Companies capable of building ships that meet the requirements listed above are encouraged to submit an expression of interest in response to this synopsis. Responses and questions regarding this synopsis should be submitted to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>christopher.paulus@navy.mil</strong></span> by&nbsp;2 November 2016. If your firm is interested in this planned procurement, it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov for additional information.

<DESC>This is a PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE only. This is not a request for proposal.
<p>General Contractor for Construction Services for the Facility-wide Modernization and Expansion of the U.S. Land Port of Entry at Alexandria Bay, New York.</p>
<p>Reference may be made to FBO Sources Sought Notice No. GS-02-P-16-DT-C-ABLPOE, posted on June 13, 2016.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS) Northeast and Caribbean Region (Region 2) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a qualified General Contractor to provide construction services for the modernization of the U.S. Land Port of Entry at Alexandria Bay, New York.</p>
<p>This requirement will be Full and Open Competition  in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code associated with this procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction; with a size standard of thirty-six million, five hundred thousand dollars ($36,500,000) average annual receipts.</p>
<p>This will be a competitively negotiated acquisition governed by procedures in FAR 15. Source selection procedures will be used to select the proposal that represents the best value to the Government by using the trade-off process. A firm fixed price contract is contemplated.</p>
<p>GSA anticipates issuing the Request for Proposal (RFP) approximately on or about November 18, 2016; with receipt of proposals at a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days later. All information, amendments and questions concerning this solicitation will be electronically posted at the FedBizOpps website via http://www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this requirement is expected to be 1737 calendar days.</p>
<p>The Estimated Construction Cost for this project is between the range of $180,000,000 and $195,000,000.</p>
<p>The facility U.S. Land Port of Entry at Alexandria Bay, New York is located at 46735 Interstate 81, Alexandria Bay, New York.</p>
<p>The Alexandria Bay Land Port of Entry (LPOE), also known as the Thousand Island Border Station, is located on Wellesley Island, New York, in the western straits of the St. Lawrence River. This LPOE is served by I-81, a major highway heavily  traveled by both commercial and non-commercial travel. From Canada, the highway provides direct access to major cities and distribution centers in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic US. The existing LPOE consists of four primary buildings constructed in 1969 and contains 52,261 usable square feet of office and inspection space. The mission of the Port of Entry is to inspect and process vehicles and individuals entering the United States from Canada. This mission is primarily carried out by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service - Veterinary Services (APHIS-VS), and The Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The General Services Administration (GSA) owns, operates, and maintains the facility.</p>
<p>In 2006, more than 676,000 passenger vehicles and 213,000 commercial vehicles utilized the Alexandria Bay POE. This station is the 6th busiest crossing for "U.S. Bound" commercial vehicles on the U.S. - Canadian border. The existing facility has an inadequate number of commercial vehicle inspection lanes, resulting in traffic congestion and delays. There is also an insufficient amount of queuing space for the traffic that passes through the LPOE.</p>
<p>The current facility no longer meets the needs of the federal inspection agencies which operate within the port of entry. The agencies are facing higher traffic volume and are required to perform more and different inspections that the original port was designed to address. This project seeks to address these problems and allow greater flexibility to the agencies changing needs.</p>
<p>The offeror selected will be required to supply all labor, materials, equipment and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract. Construction elements may include but are not limited to building construction services, fire protection, lighting, mechanical and electrical upgrades, and asbestos abatement.</p>
<p>A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held for the procurement. The date and time will be posted on FedBizOpps (estimated date is on November 30, 2016). The purpose of the conference will be to discuss the project and proposal requirements.</p>
<p>Interested firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), in order to receive a contract award. Firms can register via the Internet site at https://www.sam.gov or by contacting SAM Service Desk at http://www.fsd.gov.</p>
<p>The solicitation and associated information will be available from the FedBizOpps website mentioned above. No telephone requests will be accepted. The solicitation will not be a sealed bid and there will not be a formal bid opening. All inquiries must be in writing, via email to the person(s) specified in the solicitation. All answers will be provided in writing and will be available on the aforementioned FedBizOpps posting. Offeror's will not be reimbursed for proposal submittal expenses.</p>
<p>The solicitation documents will be posted as "secure" packages in the FedBizOpps posting.  In order to view or download the packages, vendors must have a secure account.  Information on how to register for an account and log in is available on the fbo.gov website, under the "Getting Started" tab.</p>
<p>INTERESTED PARTIES ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO THIS NOTICE TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF ACTIONS INCLUDING POSTING OF ANY AMENDMENTS. HOWEVER, OFFERORS ARE ADVISED TO CHECK THE SITE FREQUENTLY AS THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING AMENDMENTS.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: The official solicitation package and technical specifications will be located on the official government web page and the Government is not liable for information furnished by any other source.

The statutory authority permitting this award without providing full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 1901,as cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i),which authorizes the government to award contracts when there is only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br /><br />The NAICS code is 334510.<br /><br />This announcement fulfills the synopsis requirements under FAR 5.201 and 5.203. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes.

<p><br />REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Depot repair of the Receiver/Transmitter Sub-Assemblies applicable to the AN/APN-232 System, Combined Altitude Radar Altimeter (CARA).</p>
<p>Purpose/Description</p>
<p>The Government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to provide the depot repair of the Receiver/Transmitter Sub-Assemblies applicable to the AN/APN-232 System, CARA. The contractor shall be capable of furnishing all required labor, material, facilities and equipment to accomplish, repair, test, packing, preservation and packaging, and return to the government in a completely serviceable/like new condition at the unit prices established at the time of a contract award, for the items of Air Force equipment listed below. The contractor will be responsible for recurring and nonrecurring engineering services associated with becoming a qualified source. Contractor will be responsible for supply chain management, logistics, forecasting of parts, long-lead parts procurement, reparable forecasting, obsolescence issues and delivery of serviceable assets.</p>
<p>The specific assets to be repaired for this effort are found below:</p>
<p>Part Number NOUN NSN Estimated Repair<br />Requirement over <br />the next 12 months<br />8020000852-4 Radio Frequency Assy 5895-01-190-2940CW 240 each<br />8010000806-4 Signal Data Converter 5895-01-567-7326CW 24 each<br />8030005269-1 Switch Filter Assembly 5998-01-338-6519CW 12 each</p>
<p>This requirement is for repair services. Our repair strategy is a five year contract (basic plus four option years) and will continue through FY22.</p>
<p>Physical Description:<br />The Radio Frequency (RF) Assembly is a multi-function unit consisting of three subassemblies (transmitter, receiver and linearizer) providing the CARA system with the means for signal transmission of a Frequency Modulation/Continuous Wave waveform, reception and conversion of the RF signal to an IF signal and linearization of the (FM/CW) transmission. The transmit power is controlled to a level just sufficient to maintain track thereby providing the CARA system with Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) capability. The RF assembly also filters and amplifies the received signal, and using a sample of the transmitted signal as the local oscillator (LO), converts this signal to quadrate IF outputs. In addition, the RF Assembly compares a sample of the transmitted waveform with an internally generated comb of frequencies. This comparison results in the generation of quadrature video signals which are provided as outputs to the CARA processor which returns a corrected FM Sweep drive to provide the required amount of RF Sweep linerarity for the transmitted FM/CW waveform. Finally, the RF Assembly contains an externally selectable self-test signal which has been generated via an internal RF delay line.</p>
<p>The Signal Data Converter (SDC) is a component of the Combined Altitude Radar Altimeter (CARA) on the F-16 aircraft. The Converter is a solid state, microprocessor controlled signal converter which transforms the digital output of an RT- 1438/ AN-APN-232(V) Receiver-Transmitter (RT) into an altitude, and an altitude rate signal conforming to restricted F-16 1553/ 1553B protocols. In addition the Converter provides the following discrete altitude-related signals to be used by Altitude standby signal, Radar altimeter ready signal, Low altitude warning, Altimeter out-of-track and Altitude reliable signal.</p>
<p>The Switch and Filter Assembly is a potted assembly that consists of two subassemblies: The Electromagnetic Interference subassembly (A1) and the Power Switch and Regulator subassembly (A2). A1 suppresses voltage spikes and transients, while A2 reduces the filtered +28 vdc to regulated +10 vdc.</p>
<p>Performance Requirements</p>
<p>Characteristics/Capabilities<br />The AN/APN-232 CARA (COMBINED ALTITUDE RADAR ALTIMETER)<br />SPECIFICATIONS<br />WEIGHT RF POWER: Receiver Transmitter (RT) 9.2 pounds Indicator 2.5 pounds Fixed Wing Antenna 0.3 pound each Rotary Wing Antenna 0.5 pound each Adaptively Controlled at 10dB above track threshold one watt maximum<br />INPUT POWER: 28VDC MIL-STD-704 70 watts maximum (entire system)<br />DIMENSIONS: RT 3.50 x 6.30 x 8.75 inches Indicator 3.25 x 3.25 x 4.10 inches (5.3 inches front of bezel to back of connector) Fixed Wing Antenna 4.0 x 4.0 x 0.21 inches Rotary Wing Antenna 5.6 x 6.25 x 0.21 inches</p>

<SOLNBR>W15QKN-16-X-07S2
<RESPDATE>111716
<CONTACT>Laura A. Mackie, Phone 9737242293, Email laura.a.mackie.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey on behalf of the Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition System (PM-MAS) is seeking sources for the 9mm Marking Cartridges (for use in the M9 and M11 pistols and M4 Carbine). The 9mm Marking rounds (blue/red) will be used with the Close Combat Mission Capability Kit (CCMCK). The CCMCK is a user installed temporary weapon conversion system that allows the soldier to employ an individual weapon (M9, M11, and M4) at a minimum engagement distance of five (5) feet using low velocity marking ammunition while precluding the weapon from firing standard service ammunition. The marking ammunition shall be a reduced-energy, non-lethal cartridge that leaves a bright, water-soluble color marking compound on target upon impact, without penetrating the soldiers Army Combat Uniform (ACU) or Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE). The visible impact left by the marking compound allows for an accurate assessment of simulated lethality and shot placement.
<p><strong>SPECIFICATION:</strong> The ammunition must meet all requirements outlined in the Performance Specification MIL-PRF-32312. The Performance Specification is classified Distribution D (Authorized to the Department of Defense and DoD contractors only). Requests for the performance specification shall be submitted in writing using AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire (attached) along with a signed DD 2345 Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement form and a fully executed Non-Disclosure and Non Use Agreement (attached). In order to provide the data to foreign subcontractors, offerors must apply for an export license. An offeror's delay in applying for DD 2345 certification or an export license will not be a basis to extend the closing date of any future Request For Proposal (RFP). The ammunition must be compatible with the current U.S. Army qualified CCMCK weapon conversion system for the M9 and M11 and the U.S. Marine Corps qualified CCMCK upper receiver conversion system for the M4 Carbine. The National Stock Number (NSN) for the 9mm M9 weapon CCMCK conversion kit is 1005-20-003-2362. The NSN for the M11 weapon CCMCK conversion kit is 1005-20-003-2361. The NSN for the M4 Carbine CCMCK upper receiver conversion kit is 1005-01-454-9283. No additional weapon conversions or modifications outside of the current CCMCK system will be allowed. Interested sources without a previously verified design will be responsible for verifying their cartridge design in accordance with the Government performance specification MIL-PRF-32312 at their own expense.</p>
<p><strong>PLANNED ACQUISITION:</strong> The Government contemplates an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for Fiscal Years (FY) 17-20 for this acquisition. The estimated quantity to be purchased is approximately 40,000,000 with initial delivery required by May 2017 at a production rate of approximately 1,000,000 per month. Award is planned to be made in 2QFY17.</p>
<p><strong>SUBMISSION INFORMATION:</strong> To be considered as capable source for this effort, Offerors shall provide the following requested information:</p>
<p>a) Description of their capabilities to produce 9mm marking cartridges for the CCMCK. At minimum, the Offeror should adequately describe their experience in small caliber production and testing, annual production capacity, and verification status of their proposed design. Submissions should also include sketches, drawings, specifications, brochures, current estimated unit cost per million, monthly production capability, and/or testing results (as outlined below).<br />b) All contractor performed preliminary testing results to determine the current level of maturity of the ammunition design (as of the date of this sources sought), in accordance with all weapons (M9, M11 and M4) listed in MIL-PRF-32312.<br />c) Submission of data that supports the ability to produce 80,000 cartridges for design verification testing, by a production line representative of full-rate production.<br />d) Submission of all testing that has been done (as of the date of this sources sought) in accordance with ALL tests listed in the design verification testing section of MIL-PRF-32312. If contractor performed testing has not been completed, please provide additional information on plans (testing facility and equipment) to complete skin, mask, and goggle penetration, toxic fumes, and sequential rough handling testing. Specifically, the Government would like information on the timeline of these tests.<br />e) Submission of analysis and design verification testing data that supports the current ability to meet the design verification tests.<br />f) Submission of data that supports the ability to produce the first lot of at least 400,000 cartridges at full-rate production.<br />g) Those sources not having a previously verified design should also submit an outline of their plans and schedule to verify their design in addition to any backup data to support claims that their design will conform to the MIL-PRF-32312 requirements. Sources shall provide verification status of the marking ammunition cartridges that will be supplied under this contract. <br />h) Evidence of proven monthly production at a minimum rate of 1,000,000 marking cartridges per month capacity.<br />i) The company's ability to begin deliveries by May 2017 (schedule shall include testing against MIL-PRF-32312, if not already performed).</p>
<p>This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute as a pre-solicitation notice or request for proposal, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION. The Offeror shall provide all information requested in this notification within 30 days of this publication by electronic mail at no cost to the Government to Ms. Laura Mackie, Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, laura.a.mackie.civ@mail.mil. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The U.S. Government desires to procure the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Library Information Systems Requirement. We encourage all small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), to identify their capabilities in meeting the requirement at a fair market price.
<p>A need is anticipated for the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Library Information Systems Requirement. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Command is requesting information from vendors, nonprofit organizations, library consortia, and others concerning their interest in and ability to provide library management systems in a consortia environment. The goal is to create a federated TRADOC Libraries Enterprise System that will combine 13 stand-alone Libraries into a unified library management services platform. This service will combine like processes and provide the ability for staffs to work collaboratively to license, manage, discover, use, share and preserve collections (print and electronic) resources across TRADOC Libraries. Creating this single, shared system environment will enable TRADOC and the associated Army University to maintain the Academic Library System required to enable rigorous and relevant learning and to maintain its DOD and Academic Accreditations.</p>
<p>We are exploring options and investigating solutions to meet TRADOC's educational institutions' goal of moving to a shared system designed for the work of today's libraries. The system must exceed traditional integrated library system (ILS) capabilities, streamline operations and eliminate redundancies and inefficiencies associated with legacy systems that were designed primarily for management of independent print collections. In June 2016, TRADOC created a Shared Library Management Systems Coordinating Group consisting of representatives from the 13 TRADOC libraries. The strategic goal of the Coordinating Group is to review and identify unified library management services platforms that will provide increased opportunities to work collaboratively to license, manage, discover, use, share and preserve collections and resources across academic libraries.<br />Specific goals included<br />&#9642; Improve information resource discovery and sharing across institutions by providing a common discovery, access and delivery experience<br />&#9642; Shared collection management among administratively separate institutions<br />o Acquisitions and Licensing<br />o Cataloging/Metadata/Authority Control<br />o Electronic Resource Management<br />&#9642; Facilitate the management and analysis of collections across all institutions <br />&#9642; Increase operational efficiencies by lowering total operating costs and through leveraging expertise, skills and knowledge across all institutions<br />&#9642; Move towards building a "collective collection" for TRADOC Libraries <br />&#9642; To determine the approximate cost of acquiring and implementing a next-generation library services platform</p>
<p>Desired Features</p>
<p>The features listed in APPENDIX A are intentionally defined in broad terms rather than detailed functional requirements. Responses should provide enough information to convey the capabilities of the service but are not expected to include a detailed summary of all functions. Note that the term "collections" is intended to include all types of materials that comprise an academic and technical library collection, whether published, unique, digital or print. Throughout your response, describe where participating libraries will be able to customize features, workflows, etc.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) is organizing their professional military education programs into a university system to increase academic rigor, create greater opportunities for accreditation, and enhance the quality of the force. Named "the Army University", this initiative will align the officer, warrant officer, non-commissioned officer, and civilian education programs across TRADOC under a single academic structure. The TRADOC Libraries are the academic libraries that support a number of the schools/programs that now make-up Army University. The libraries will function collectively as the Army University Library, while continuing to provide support to the individual schools with which they are associated. See APPENDIX B for a description of these libraries.</p>

<DESC><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and there is no solicitation package available and no contract will be awarded as a result of this request.<strong><br /><span style="BACKGROUND: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow"><br /></span></strong></span>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ (NAWCADLKE) is seeking information from industry regarding replacement of the legacy Inertial Device Test Set (IDTS), which is used to test and verify the operational accuracy of Units Under Test (UUTs). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>At least 104 replacement systems will likely be needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A draft version of the Requirements Analysis Document (RAD) available per request. NAWCADLKE is seeking a solution via one of the approaches as outlined in Section 2.0 of the RAD. The UUTs are noted in Section 3.0 of the RAD. The performance requirements are noted in Section 4.0 of the RAD. </span>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">NAWCADLKE has been considering the following two design approaches.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The first design approach being considered would NOT use an Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) to verify UUT operation. For example, this alternative could use a Truth table (calculated inputs for Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) simulation) or other means with software support that could verify if an unknown UUT is Ready for Issue (RFI) by performing diagnostic tests via a Test Program Set (TPS). This option could simulate dynamics for both the GPS and INS portions of Embedded GPS / Inertial Navigation System (EGI) systems in a coordinated and coherent way so that the GPS and INS navigation solutions do not diverge and the blended solution represents real world requirements. The system could provide accurate dynamic GPS and inertial simulations that are fed into the EGI as if the EGI were on land or onboard ship as a test methodology. This approach could simulate and use a maintenance or test simulator key as related to an M-code GPS signal encryption requirement. Additionally, it could be used to simulate the classified aspects of the M and Y- Code signal and adjust the GPS signal accordingly. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This alternative </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">would be required to be approved for both ashore and shipboard use.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The other design approach being considered would require capability for both ashore and shipboard use </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">to compare inertial and navigation output information from a known good IRU to that of an unknown UUT device. This approach should be capable of measuring the difference in altitude, velocity, position and inertial information of the two devices and verifying the acceptability of the UUT. This option could interface with the ship's Navigation Sensor System Interface (NAVSSI) for shipboard use and a GPS device for land-based use to initialize the IDTS IRU.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The GPS would be Y, M, P and C/A (YMCA) Code signal capable. The IDTS could be configured to test either an IRU or an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This method will verify if the UUT is Ready for Issue (RFI) by performing diagnostic tests via a Test Program Set (TPS).</span></p>

<DESC>OAKS BOTTOM RESTORATION PROJECT:
<p>This is not a solicitation. This Sources Sought Announcement is for the purpose of identifying firms which are capable and interested in offering a proposal for the following project:<br />The Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge is a 160-acre park with diverse habitats including an extensive floodplain located along the east bank of the Lower Willamette River at approximately River Mile 16 in southeast Portland, Oregon. The project area is within the 100-year floodplain of the Willamette River, which is within the tidal zone of the Columbia River. The Willamette River merges with the Columbia River approximately 16 miles downstream of the project site. Daily freshwater tidal fluctuations typically range up to 2.5 feet in the project area. Oaks Bottom offers a unique opportunity for a large, natural, tidally influenced floodplain and wetland area to be restored in the heart of the city. The purpose of the proposed action is to restore a more natural tidal hydrologic connection between Oaks Bottom and the Lower Willamette River, improve diverse fish and wildlife habitats, reduce non-native species populations, and provide unhindered fish passage into and out of Oaks Bottom. A number of restoration measures were considered during the plan formulation process undertaken in this Feasibility Study and evaluated based on their potential benefits to fish and wildlife and costs. The recommended restoration plan includes the following elements:</p>
<p>&bull; Replacement of the culvert under the railroad berm with a 16-foot by 10-foot culvert,<br />&bull; Removal of the water control structure,<br />&bull; Excavation of tidal slough channels to connect to the reservoir and southern ponds,<br />&bull; Removal of invasive species,<br />&bull; Revegetation with riparian and wetland species along the channels and around the perimeter of the reservoir and southern ponds, and<br />&bull; Placement of two viewing platforms adjacent to the Springwater Trail.</p>
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT SUBMITAL REQUEST:</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to assess advancements in Head Protection (i.e. Helmets and Hard Hats) that could improve Coast Guard mission performance. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI. <br /><br />The USCG is conducting research to identify both operational and advanced prototype technologies. "Operational" in this context refers to existing technologies and equipment that are currently used in commercial and/or Government application, while "advanced prototype" in this context refers to proven and near-proven technologies that are expected to be available in the commercial and/or Government market in the next 12 to 18 months.<br /><br />The USCG intends to use the information collected from this RFI to conduct detailed systems analysis that quantifies and evaluates technology readiness and applicability, device or equipment capability, and acquisition (non-recurring) and life-cycle operating costs (recurring). You are invited to respond with information to assist the CG with its market research to identify potential sources of Helmets and Hard Hats (H&amp;HH). <br /><br />BACKGROUND<br />The Coast Guard currently outfits and deploys its surface forces with various head protection systems for various missions and/or activities (i.e. Ports Waterways Coastal Security, Search and Rescue, Heavy Weather Surf Operations, Pursuit Operations, Maritime Law Enforcement Operations, Ice Rescue, and Aids to Navigation Operations). This RFI is requesting solutions to increase the current technical capabilities of the existing H&amp;HHs and is not limited to the types of H&amp;HHs currently deployed. Two categories of Helmets are of interest including a) Non-Ballistic and b) Ballistic. <br /><br />SPECIFIC TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUESTED <br />The Coast Guard RDC desires detailed information regarding H&amp;HH technologies.

11. BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF WORK BY CATEGORY
Inpatient and Observation records:
The PTF was developed in 1983 and is the automated discharge database for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  PTF maintains a record on every inpatient treated in a VA facility or in a non-VA facility at VA expense.  These PTF records provide a computerized abstract of each patient discharge and contain over 100 different data items which describe the characteristics of the patient and the reason for the hospital stay.
Each VA facility electronically submits PTF data to the VA Data Processing Center (DPC) in Austin, Texas.  Reports are compiled by facility from hospitals, nursing homes, and domiciliary and are sent to the facility.
The information from the reports is used for local quality improvement (QI) studies, The Joint Commission physician reviews, VISN budget planning, and Diagnostic Related Groups (DRG).  Interest in PTF has increased as a result of the realization that tremendous financial losses can occur from incomplete or inaccurate data.
PTF is broken down into several different abstracting transactions:
o	N101	Admission Transaction - Records demographic data and type of admission, service connection, and eligibility.

o	N501	Patient Movement/Discharge Diagnosis Transaction - Establishes a patient movement transaction within a single period of hospitalization, including primary and secondary diagnoses.

o	N701/702	Disposition Transaction - The disposition transaction is completed upon release from inpatient care, death, or transfer.  This includes primary and secondary diagnoses for the entire hospitalization. The N702 will be prepared when a patient has more than one diagnostic code to be entered.

o	N401	Surgical Transaction - Represents a separate incident of surgery as identified by the date of surgery.

o	N601	Procedural Transaction - Represents a separate incident of a non-OR procedure as identified by the date of the procedure.

Should the facility not have observation beds, the VA medical center will substitute records from any of the other categories.
Outpatient Records:
In 1995, the Under Secretary for Health directed that as of October 1, 1996, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities were to begin collecting and reporting coded diagnostic, procedural and practitioner data for all ambulatory care encounters.  While VHA facilities had been electronically reporting information about each outpatient visit to the national Outpatient Clinic System (OPC), the new requirement forced a major shift in the way VHA medical centers collected and stored ambulatory care information.  Outpatient information is entered through the VISTA Patient Care Encounter (PCE).

Facilities now report patient identity, date and time of service, practitioners (by Health Care Finance Administration [HCFA] Individual Provider Taxonomy type code), place of service, active problem(s) (by ICD-10-CM code), and service(s) provided (by CPT-4 code and HCPCS code) for every ambulatory encounter and/or ancillary service.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE - THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE AWARD:<br />The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Veterinary Services (VS) in Frankfort KY intends to negotiate a sole source award to Ellie LLC <br />DUNS: 079278876 CAGE Code: 72EE3 for a 5 year Blanket Purchase Agreement with ELLIE LLC, to supply Brucella Abortus Antibody Test kits
<p>This procurement is being conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253( c )(1) <br />The property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency.</p>
<p>The proposed action will consist of the purchase of Ellie Brucella Abortus FPA Test Kits (1,000 tests per kit). 10ea kits containing 1,000 tests per kit to be used in conjunction with the BioTek Synergy 2 Fluorescence Polarization Assay (FPA) instruments in the USDA/APHIS/VS approved State-Federal brucellosis laboratories. Ellie LLC is the sole source for the Brucella Abortus FPA Test Kit manufactured for use with the BioTek Synergy 2 FPA instruments. APHIS Veterinary Services. VS' wide-ranging responsibilities include coordinating national animal health emergency preparedness and disease response, diagnosing foreign and domestic animal diseases, monitoring the health and disease status of U.S. livestock and poultry, directing national programs to eradicate selected animal diseases, and managing key activities in a national network of laboratories to perform day-to-day testing and provide emergency response capability.<br />APHIS has evaluated the FPA and found it to be a highly sensitive and specific test for detecting brucellosis infected animals. FPA technology has a Transparent trail of published research that documents its accuracy and repeatability when used for cattle, bison, swine and cervids. The data from various studies clearly show that the FPA performs as well as or better than the conventional serological tests for brucellosis. In addition, it is faster to perform and produces quantitative test results using an automated instrument which removes much of the subjectivity inherent in other serological tests.<br />Use of accurate disease diagnostic testing technology is paramount to identifying and eradicating brucellosis in a timely manner. The Surveillance Program currently uses a number of tests in the serological diagnosis of brucellosis. Some of these tests are prone to subjectivity and lack specificity for accurately identifying truly diseased animals. The FPA test, a test used in human medicine for years, has been adapted for use in the field and the laboratory for the detection of brucellosis in cattle, bison, swine and cervids.</p>

<SOLNBR>R17PS00022
<ARCHDATE>10262016
<CONTACT>Dieguez, Leslie
<DESC>Project Title: Sonic Telemetry Equipment

This solicitation is being advertised as a noncompetitive sole source solicitation. As provided under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), this project will be solicited on a noncompetitive basis as "Only one source is reasonably available to satisfy the agency's requirements."  

The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award, on a sole source basis, a single firm-fixed price purchase order to Sonotronics, Inc. located in Tucson, AZ.  The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement to purchase several types of ultrasonic transmitters and towable hydrophones. The following are the product item descriptions, salient characteristics, and the quantities Reclamation intends to purchase: 

Purchase fifty-eight (58) ultrasonic transmitters for internal implantation in fish. Transmitters should have a minimum battery life of 9 months, a maximum size of 47 mm long x 11 mm in diameter, a detection range of > 500 meters, and should weigh less than or equal to 4 g in water (Sonotronics IBT-96-9-I). These transmitters will allow researchers to actively or passively track sub-adult fish for the life of the tag, providing researchers the opportunity to determine habitat preferences and movement patterns of rare fish species. Purchase another twenty-five (25) ultrasonic transmitters for internal implantation in fish. Transmitters should have a minimum battery life of 36 months, a maximum size of 63 mm long x 16 mm in diameter, a detection range of > 750 meters and should weigh less than or equal to 10 g in water (Sonotronics CT-05-36-I). These transmitters will allow researchers to actively or passively track adult fish for the life of the tag, providing researchers the opportunity to determine habitat preferences and movement patterns of rare fish species. Additionally, purchase ten (10) ultrasonic transmitters for internal implantation in fish. Transmitters should have a minimum battery life of 90 days, a maximum size of 25 mm long x 9 mm in diameter, a detection range of > 500 meters, and should weigh less than or equal to 2.3 g in water (Sonotronics PT-4). These transmitters will allow researchers to actively or passively track juvenile fish for the life of the tag, providing researchers the opportunity to determine habitat preferences and movement patterns of rare fish species. Lastly, purchase three (3) towable Omni-directional hydrophones (Sonotronics TH-2 or equivalent). Hydrophones must attach to any Sonotronics brand ultrasonic receiver, be capable of functioning while towed at trolling speeds of approximately 5 knots, and have a cable length of at least 50 feet. This minimum cable length is necessary to minimize the interference caused by engine and propeller noise.

Sonotronics, Inc. is the sole source and manufacturer of all Sonotronics receivers, hydrophones, and transmitters.  Due to its proprietary nature, only Sonotronics equipment and software are compatible. 

A Determination to Solicit Sole Source is being prepared in support of this acquisition.

This procurement will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures.  It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order be awarded no later than November 1, 2016.  Questions and other documents maybe submitted to Leslie Dieguez via e-mail to ldieguez@usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334513 and the size standard is 750 employees.

The contract award information will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (FBO) at (www.fbo.gov).

<a href="mailto:gina.crank@va,gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Karl Storz Endoscopy-America Inc. to lease five (5) Flexible Ureteroscopes and nineteen (19) Flexible Video Cystoscopes and the associated sterilization trays. The Chalmers P. Wylie VA Ambulatory Care Center Columbus (VAACC) is seeking to upgrade their existing Karl Storz Cystoscopes and Karl Storz Flexible Ureteroscopes.  VAACC Columbus is already standardized with Karl Storz Cystoscopes, Resectoscopes, Rigid Nephroscopes, Flexible Cystoscopes, Flexible Ureteroscopes, Rigid Telescopes and Semi-Rigid Ureteroscopes.  In addition, the VA is currently using the Karl Storz Telepack X Video system in the Urology Clinic which is currently only compatible with the Karl Storz Video Cystoscopes.  The instrumentation that is used with the telescopes is also vendor specific and the facility has only Storz accessories.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334510.  The Government believes that Karl Storz Endoscopy-America Inc. is the only provider that can satisfy the agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to proceed with a sole source for the required Flexible Ureteroscopes and Flexible Video Cystoscopes and the associated sterilization trays.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302 - only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy agency requirements.  To the best of our knowledge, Karl Storz Endoscopy-America Inc. is the only source that provides the above indicated services/supplies.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document is available; however, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within seven (7) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, VA Ambulatory Care Center, 420 N. James Road, Columbus, Ohio 43219-1834 or faxed to 614.388.7500.  Responses received will be evaluated, however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the VA Ambulatory Care Center Columbus will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Karl Storz Endoscopy-America Inc.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The U.S. AbilityOne Commission (operating name of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Commission, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Commission's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Commission is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-0823<br />Name:		Tab, Self-Stick, Durable, 1", Assorted Colors<br />Description:	Self-stick tabs are durable and writable. Tabs are 1" and issued in a dispenser that holds 22 flags of each of red, blue and yellow. UOI is PG. PG = 66 tabs</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-0824<br />Name:		Tabs, Self-Stick, Filing, Repositionable, 2", Red/Yellow<br />Description:	Self-stick, filing tabs are writable. Tabs are 2" and issued in a dispenser that holds 22 flags of each of red and yellow. UOI is PG. PG = 44 tabs</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-01-421-4751<br />Name:		Tabs, Self-Stick, Page Makers Repositionable, .5" x 2", Assorted Colors<br />Description:	Page markers are repositionable and writable. Page markers are .5" x 2" and come in assorted colors. UOI is PG. PG = 500</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Commission to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Commission considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-0823<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	3M 686RYB; RTG33148; Avery&reg; Mini Ultra Tabs<sup>TM</sup> 74763</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-NIB-0824<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	3M 6862RY; Redi-Tag Manf #31080; 74753, Avery&reg;; 74754Avery&reg;; 74767 Avery; 74757 Avery</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-01-421-4751<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	3M 6705AN; RTG20202; RTG20205; 3M 5487; BSN 36622</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no adverse impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please visit http://abilityone.gov/distributors/potential.html for more information.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Commission no later than November 1, 2016 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Commission will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Commission and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Commission's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent, pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. The United States Department of Education (the Department), Contracts and Acquisitions Management (CAM) intend to award a sole source firm-fixed-price contract to the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC), based in Herndon, VA (http://www.studentclearinghouse.org/) to continually match the Department's financial aid and sample survey data (student records) with enrollment and degree data from the proprietary database held by NSC. This match fulfills one of two purposes:</p>
<p>1. Education Statistics: Data are matched to students sampled or selected in surveys conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The resulting data from these matches are processed, perturbed, de-identified, merged with existing data, and are subsequently used for statistical and scholarly research by the Department and licensees under its Restricted Use Data program (https://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/licenses.asp). <br />2. Audit, Evaluation, Compliance, and Enforcement: These data are matched to the Department's internal databases to administer or evaluate educational programs; for program compliance; or the enforcement of a Federal Regulation or law, especially those governing Title IV Federal Student Aid. These datasets are typically not released to the public.<br />The estimated contract period of performance will be 36 months from date of award, with two option periods consisting of 36 months each. The Department contemplates a contract award by December 2016.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. This is for informational purposes only. Should you have any questions or comments regarding this notice, please contact by e-mail, Brenda.Jefferson@ed.gov and copy Thomas.Smith@ed.gov, no later than October 28, 2016.</p>

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, sole source, fixed price contract with Occupational Health Dynamics, Inc. (OHD), 2687 John Hawkins Parkway, Hoover, AL, 35244-4003, for the purpose of procuring annual calibration, maintenance and software upgrades to its existing Quantifit Fit Testers.
<p>The FBI requires annual calibration, maintenance, and software upgrades to its thirty eight (38) existing QuantiFit Fit Tester machines, manufactured by Occupational Health Dynamics, Inc. (OHD). The calibration and maintenance of the QuantiFit Fit Tester machines is crucial to mission operability and continuous personnel safety. The service must be performed by a manufacturer authorized representative to maintain warranty of the equipment. Occupational Health Dynamics, Inc. does not authorize any other vendors to work on their equipment.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Occupational Health Dynamics, Inc. is the sole owner and manufacturer of the Quantifit Fit Tester Systems and the only source capable of providing the required calibration, maintenance and software upgrades to the existing Quantifit Fit Testers.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 334510, Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing.</p>
<p>The FBI intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to the attention of: Kemper Wood, email address: Kemper.Wood@ic.fbi.gov by Monday, October 24, 2016 (8:00 am Eastern).

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time, sole source, fixed price contract with Bode Cellmark Forensics, Inc., 10430 Furnace Road, Suite 107, Lorton, VA, 22079-2626, for the purpose of procuring proficiency testing services that meet the technical requirements of the DNA units for testing Serology, Mixture, Nuclear DNA, and Mitochondrial DNA technologies.
<p>The FBI requires proficiency testing to maintain the FBI Laboratory's accreditation by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, Laboratory Accreditation (ASCLD/LAB). Through this accreditation the Laboratory is currently bound by the ASCLD/LAB-International program and must comply with the standards outlined in the ASCLD/LAB-International 2006 Supplemental Requirements for the Accreditation of Forensic Testing Laboratories and the International Standard ISO/IEC 17025. ASCLD/LAB-International requires that proficiency test must be purchased from vendors that have met all the ASCLD/LAB-International's strict criteria for the production of proficiency test. Currently, Bode Cellmark Forensics is the only approved vendor capable of providing the type of proficiency testing required by the FBI that meet the technical requirements of the DNA units for testing Serology, Mixture, Nuclear DNA, and Mitochondrial DNA technologies. Bode Cellmark proficiency test samples are the only samples on the market that can be used to test any and all of these technologies. In addition, the restrictive schedule of other approved providers would limit the unit's ability to concurrently complete casework in a timely fashion and therefore prevent a recurring backlog. Specifically, other proficiency test providers require approximately an eight week turnaround while test provider Bode Cellmark requires a sixteen week turnaround. The issuance of proficiency tests increases the FBI's workload by 20% and therefore the more restrictive time constraint would significantly reduce the number of casework samples processed during this period and would result in a greater impact on operations.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Bode Cellmark Forensics, Inc. is the only approved vendor capable of providing the type of proficiency testing required by the FBI.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov).

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Energy Security Division (ESD), is seeking to award a contract to Zen Innovations to obtain a corporate-wide seat license to an online database, the Global Trade Tracker (GTT).  GTT, which covers up to 91 countries and provides users with access to energy commodity trade data from the world?s principal trading countries in support of the Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), Country Analysis Briefs (CAB), and various contingency requests and disruption analyses.  GTT is a unique tool that provides: 1) ?mirror reporting,? which allows deduced/inferred data to be captured based on the information issued by primary reporting countries, and 2) un-manipulated output data, enabling a clear, objective picture of global trade flows to be analyzed.  As a proprietary product, Zen Innovations maintains exclusive ownership of GTT. As such, the product is unavailable from any other distribution source.  The period of performance for this potential award is a single base year and two single year option periods.  
The DOE is using exemption to competition 6.302-1(a)(2), One Responsible Source.  This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation is available for this requirement.  If a firm believes the DOE should not pursue an award to Zen Innovations, than they should submit a capability statement by 8 A.M. EST November 9, 2016.  A determination by the Government to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Electron Physics Group in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC located in Thornwood, NY under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source.
<p>The Electron Physics Group in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology has an ongoing program to develop cold atom ion sources for focused ion beam applications. As part of this program the group recently acquired a Zeiss CrossBeam 540 focused-ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIBSEM), which allows nanoscale machining with the focused ion beam (FIB) and observation with the scanning electron microscope (SEM). New developments in our research now require an enhancement to this instrument, a gas injection system (GIS), which allows deposition of material by introducing a gas precursor onto the sample while simultaneous irradiating the surface with the FIB or the SEM electron beam. The gas injection system will be used to deposit protective coatings on lithium-injected samples in planned research on lithium ion battery materials. In addition, the GIS will serve as an enhancement to nanoscale machining processes, and enhanced etching processes.</p>
<p>In order to function properly, a GIS must be fully integrated with the FIBSEM hardware, electronics, and software. Only then can the degree of control be exercised to ensure accurate deposition of material. As a result, gas injection systems are manufactured by the FIBSEM manufacturer themselves, or through close, exclusive relationships with third party vendors in which the GIS is sold through the FIBSEM manufacturer.</p>
<p>The proprietary nature of FIBSEM hardware, electronics and software makes it impossible to create a functioning system without the technical knowledge provided by such a relationship. GIS suppliers will not sell a system for use on any FIBSEM other than the one which it is designed to operate with, since they cannot guarantee that it will operate correctly.</p>
<p>As a result, the only responsible source for a GIS for our Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC FIBSEM is Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC. This equipment is proprietary to Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC as they are the only source to procure the equipment from as they have no authorized distributors or resellers of this equipment.</p>
<p><br />The NAICS Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1000 employees. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order for this requirement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by the established date and time.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to solicit and award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

The Naval Facilities (NAVFAC) Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (EXWC) intends to solicit and award a sole source follow-on contract to Pacific Data Electric, Inc. (PDE), 9970 Bell Ranch Dr., Ste 109, Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670-6187, to complete the installation and start-up of the EXWC MicroGrid Test Bed. The anticipated period of performance will be a period of 9 months.

FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) implements the authority to limit competition to an original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services, and award to any other source would likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyâ€™s requirements.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

Any inquiries into this notice shall be by email to the Contract Specialist: Marianna Suarez 
(marianna.suarez@navy.mil).

<DESC>The Defense Forensic Science Center (DFSC) (formerly the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL)) provides forensic laboratory services to DoD military criminal investigative organizations (Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Naval Criminal Investigative Service, and the Army Criminal Investigation Command) and other DoD customers. It is a full service forensic laboratory, providing state-of-the-art forensic examinations in the following disciplines:
<p>&bull; DNA/Serology<br />&bull; Digital Evidence<br />&bull; Drug Chemistry<br />&bull; Firearms and Toolmarks<br />&bull; Forensic Documents<br />&bull; Latent Prints (including footwear and tire track evidence)<br />&bull; Trace Evidence</p>
<p>The DFSC has three primary objectives:</p>
<p>(1) Analyze forensic evidence and provide expert testimony to support worldwide criminal investigation across all <br />military services<br />(2) Provide expeditionary and reach-back forensic services to U.S. military forces in active theaters of operation<br />(3) Coordinate and execute research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) projects to advance forensic<br />capabilities</p>
<p>The Department of Defense Forensic Research and Development Program ("Program") is administered by the U.S. Army Research Office and the Defense Forensic Science Center. The Program aims to enhance the capability of forensic science applications in traditional law enforcement/criminal justice purviews and in expeditionary environments. The Program accomplishes this mission by funding research projects that lead to the production of useful knowledge, materials, devices, systems, or methods that have forensic function.</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award under this announcement, a prospective awardee must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources and responsibility, ability to comply with the performance schedule, past performance, integrity, experience, technical capabilities, operational controls, and facilities. In accordance with Federal statutes, regulations, and Department of Defense and Army policies, no person on grounds of race, color, age, sex, national origin, or disability shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from the Army.</p>
<p>The Program is seeking proposals for funding to support forensic research and its application. The requested proposals should focus on adding to general forensic knowledge and/or DFSC activities and needs. Forensic research proposals should focus on the creation of new and improved field or laboratory functional capabilities that result in faster, more robust, more informative, less costly, or less labor-intensive recognition, preservation, collection, and/or analysis of forensic evidence. Proposals involving the development of equipment that is portable, sustainable, and useful in an expeditionary or field environment are also solicited. The expeditionary and field environments require systems that are lightweight, portable, inexpensive, fast, and capable of operating in extreme environments of temperature, dust, humidity, etc. The systems must also be capable of secure data communications.</p>
<p>Funding of research and development (R&amp;D) within Program areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during each budget cycle. Due to Government budget uncertainties, no specific dollars have been reserved for awards under this BAA. Those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to submit a white paper and quad chart, summarizing their proposed work. If the proposed R&amp;D warrants further inquiry and funding is available, submission of a full technical and cost proposal will be encouraged. This sequence allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and minimizes the labor and cost associated with submission of full proposals that have minimal probability of being selected for funding. Costs associated with white paper, quad chart, or full proposal submissions in response to this BAA are not considered allowable direct charges to any resulting award. These costs may be allowable expenses to normal bid and proposal indirect costs specified in FAR 31.205-18 for contracts. Offerors submitting proposals are cautioned that only a Government Contracting or Grants Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds.</p>

MilGaming is an website with a broad community of interest for all U.S. military services, government agencies and their supporting contractors and affiliates to download game software and supporting content and share resources, knowledge and experience in support of modeling, simulation and training (MS&amp;T) programs.</p>
<p>The MilGaming 3D Model Purchase objective is to procure 3D models at the required specifications including source files from a 3D model vendor that will be hosted on a central library to support the modeling, simulation and training (MS&amp;T) needs of the MilGaming user community. 3D Models will be of the quality used in modern AAA game titles for use in next generation first person simulation, gaming, and virtual trainers that use various commercial game engines (i.e. VBS+, Unreal4+, and Unity5+).</p>

Standard software measuring tools will be used for quality check of model attributes to include file formats, scene organization, basic dimensions, scale, orientation, geometry and topology complexity and structure, texturing, UV use, and rigging. A sample 3D model failing the technical evaluation will be rejected, and both the sample and the proposal will not be considered further.

<DESC>Digitization of Microfilm for the Library of Congress
<p>The Library of Congress FEDLINK program is issuing a request for proposal to procure digitization services on behalf of the Library of Congress Library Services.</p>

It is also the largest library in the world, with over 158 million books, recordings, photographs, maps, films and video, sheet music, sound recordings, and manuscripts in its collections. Preserving its resources and making them available and useful to the Congress and the American people is a key part of the Library's mission, and an aggressive digitization program supports that aim.</p>
<p>The Library has selected groups of 35mm master microfilm reels from various collections for digitization. These reels contain microfilm images of music, manuscripts, other archival documents, and a variety of other special collection items. The Library estimates between 500 and 1,300 frames per reel; each frame will result in a single image.</p>

Derivative images (JPEG, JPEG2000, and/or GIF) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) services that produce text data from scanned images are also required. Images and associated metadata shall be delivered according to the BagIt specification.</p>
<p>Digitization requirements are driven by the most current version of the information capture specifications, quality guidelines, and content categories and digitization objectives recommended by the Still Image Group of the Federal Agencies Digitization Guidelines Initiative ("FADGI").</p>
<p>Digital conversion will take place on site at the Library of Congress.</p>
<p>FEDLINK services are used by federal libraries and information centers worldwide. Written responses should include prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability. No telephone calls will be accepted. Ref: LCFDL16RFP015 - DLCV.</p>
<p>Deadline for questions is COB Wed., November 2, 2016<br /><br />For further information on the Library of Congress FEDLINK program, please visit our website at: http://www.loc.gov/flicc or contact James Oliver, Vendor Services Coordinator, on (202) 707-4960 or joli@loc.gov.</p>

<p>The FDA requires animal husbandry support services to both animal research programs including but not limited to the provision of quality care to all research animals, sanitation of all animal care and diet preparation/formulation facilities and the provision of protocol-specified technical procedures support, as well as ancillary tasks necessary to accomplish these services, i.e.: quality control, occupational safety and health, inventory control, equipment maintenance, development and maintenance of standard operating procedures, and a comprehensive training program.

<p>Addenda to FAR 52.212-4 are as follows:</p>
<p>1852.215-84 OMBUDSMAN. (NOV 2011)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this<br />acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source<br />of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the<br />ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or<br />the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with an ombudsman,<br />interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or<br />recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.</p>
<p>(b) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the<br />installation ombudsman, whose name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and email<br />address may be found at: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html. Concerns,<br />issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may<br />be referred to the Agency ombudsman identified at the above URL. Please do not contact the<br />ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical<br />requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer or as specified<br />elsewhere in this document.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.3 1852.223-72 SAFETY AND HEALTH (SHORT FORM). (JUL 2015)<br />(a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational<br />illness; damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. NASA is<br />committed to protecting the safety and health of the public, our team members, and those<br />assets that the Nation entrusts to the Agency.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall have a documented, comprehensive and effective health and safety<br />program with a proactive process to identify, assess, and control hazards and take all<br />reasonable safety and occupational health measures consistent with standard industry practice<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c) in subcontracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold where work will be conducted completely or partly on Federally-controlled facilities.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.4 1852.225-70 EXPORT LICENSES. (FEB 2000)<br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the<br />International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120 through 130, and the Export<br />Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730 through 799, in the performance of this contract. In the absence of available license exemptions/exceptions, the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of hardware, technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing foreign persons in the performance of this contract, including instances where the work is to be performed on-site at NASA Langley Research Center, where the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technical data or software.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the use of licenses and license exemptions/exceptions.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the provisions of this clause apply to its subcontractors.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.5 1852.237-73 RELEASE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION. (JUN 2005)<br />(a) As used in this clause, "sensitive information" refers to information, not currently in the public domain, that the Contractor has developed at private expense, that may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and that may be sensitive or privileged.</p>
<p>(b) In accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies heavily on the support of various service providers. To support NASA activities and functions, these service providers, as well as their subcontractors and their individual employees, may need access to sensitive information submitted by the Contractor under this contract. By submitting this proposal or performing this contract, the Contractor agrees that NASA may release to its service providers, their subcontractors, and their individual employees, sensitive information submitted during the course of this procurement, subject to the enumerated protections mandated by the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information.</p>
<p>(c)(1) The Contractor shall identify any sensitive information submitted in support of this proposal or in performing this contract. For purposes of identifying sensitive information, the<br />Contractor may, in addition to any other notice or legend otherwise required, use a notice similar to the following:</p>
<p>Mark the title page with the following legend:</p>
<p>This proposal or document includes sensitive information that NASA shall not disclose outside the Agency and its service providers that support management activities and administrative functions. To gain access to this sensitive information, a service provider's contract must contain the clause at NFS 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. Consistent with this clause,<br />the service provider shall not duplicate, use, or disclose the information in whole or in part for any purpose other than to perform the services specified in its contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use this information if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The information subject to this restriction is contained in pages (insert page numbers or other identification of pages).</p>
<p>Mark each page of sensitive information the Contractor wishes to restrict with the following<br />legend:</p>
<p>Use or disclosure of sensitive information contained on this page is subject to the restriction on<br />the title page of this proposal or document.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the facts supporting any claim that particular<br />information is "sensitive." This evaluation shall consider the time and resources necessary to<br />protect the information in accordance with the detailed safeguards mandated by the clause at<br />1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. However, unless the Contracting Officer decides,<br />with the advice of Center counsel, that reasonable grounds exist to challenge the Contractor's<br />claim that particular information is sensitive, NASA and its service providers and their<br />employees shall comply with all of the safeguards contained in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(d) To receive access to sensitive information needed to assist NASA in accomplishing<br />management activities and administrative functions, the service provider must be operating<br />under a contract that contains the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. This<br />clause obligates the service provider to do the following:</p>
<p>(1) Comply with all specified procedures and obligations, including the Organizational Conflicts<br />of Interest Avoidance Plan, which the contract has incorporated as a compliance document.</p>
<p>(2) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession only for the purpose of<br />performing the services specified in its contract.</p>
<p>(3) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from unauthorized use and<br />disclosure.</p>
<p>(4) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees that need it to perform<br />services under its contract.</p>
<p>(5) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to persons and entities outside of<br />the service provider's organization.</p>
<p>(6) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information about their obligations to<br />utilize it only to perform the services specified in its contract and to safeguard it from<br />unauthorized use and disclosure.</p>
<p>(7) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has received and will comply<br />with training on the authorized uses and mandatory protections of sensitive information needed<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(8) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply with all reasonable<br />security procedures, report any breaches to the Contracting Officer, and implement any<br />necessary corrective actions.</p>
<p>(e) When the service provider will have primary responsibility for operating an information<br />technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the service provider's contract<br />shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information<br />Technology Resources. The Security Requirements clause requires the service provider to<br />implement an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or<br />transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use. Service provider personnel<br />requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to these information technology systems<br />are subject to screening using the standard National Agency Check (NAC) forms appropriate to<br />the level of risk for adverse impact to NASA missions. The Contracting Officer may allow the<br />service provider to conduct its own screening, provided the service provider employs<br />substantially equivalent screening procedures.</p>
<p>(f) This clause does not affect NASA's responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (g), suitably modified to<br />reflect the relationship of the parties, in all subcontracts that may require the furnishing of<br />sensitive information.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

L. 113-235), Government agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.
(b)  The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. 
	(c) Representation.  By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold. The contracting officer shall indicate whether electronic submissions of quotations will be accepted. Paragraph (b)(4) of provision 1352.213?71 may be tailored based on the evaluation factors. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.302?1?70, insert the following provision: Instructions for Submitting Quotations Under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial (Date) (a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition is ____. (b) Submission of quotations. Submit quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. At a minimum, quotations must show? (1) The solicitation number; (2) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; (3) Acknowledgment of solicitation amendments; (4) A technical description showing that the offeror can supply the requirements in the specifications or statement of work in sufficient detail to allow the Government to evaluate the quotation in accordance with the evaluation factors stated in the solicitation. (5) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and reference information (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information). (6) Price and any supporting details for the price, as requested in the solicitation. (c) Offerors are responsible for submitting quotations, and any modifications thereto, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified. The offeror's initial quotation should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest quotation; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations received. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.
As prescribed in 1346.503, insert the following clause: Place of Acceptance (APR 2010) (a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO SEPARATE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.

THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE PROCUREMENT. A market research study was conducted by NAVFAC Southwest that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms. Upon review of the market research, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) in San Diego determined that a Small Business Set-Aside procurement is appropriate. The NAVFAC SW small business office concurs with the SBA determination.

Architect-Engineer (A-E) services are required for a firm fixed-price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Interior Design Services.
 Projects under this contract will occur at various military installations located in the NAVFAC Southwest (SW) Area of Responsibility (AOR) (California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah) and the NAVFAC Pacific AOR (Hawaii, Japan, Guam), but may be also available to the NAVFAC (AOR) as approved by the NAVFAC SW Chief of Contracting Office (CCO).  Travel will be required to the project sites.  The Offeror/Contractor must demonstrate adequate in-house staffing capability to self-perform at least 50 percent of the cost of the contract as required by FAR Clause 52.219-14(b) (1) Limitation on Subcontracting.

A-E Design and Engineering Services shall mainly provide for, but not be limited to, INTERIOR DESIGN related services.
 All A-E services will be in accordance with the scope of this contract, Industry Design Codes and Standards and Department of Defense Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) such as Antiterrorism, Energy and Sustainable Design, Safety and Health Requirements. For this contract, the lead discipline shall be a certified Interior Designer.  Acceptable certifications are a National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) certification or a state and/or jurisdiction Interior Design Certification, Registration, or License. The number of design task orders per fiscal year may vary and may involve surges of multiple projects with overlapping delivery dates.

A-E services required:   The work will primarily include preparing Comprehensive Interior Design (CID) for various types of facilities.
  CID includes Structural Interior Design (SID) and Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment (FF and E) Interior Design.  SID includes selection and coordination of interior finish materials that are integral to or attached to the building structure.  FF and E interior design includes design, selection, specification, color coordination, and procurement documentation of the required items.  SID packages will typically include furniture floor plans, finish schedules, and any supporting interior elevations, details, or plans necessary to communicate the building finish design and build out.  FF and E packages will typically include placement plans, ordering and finish information on all freestanding furnishings and accessories, cost estimates, and best value determinations.
  

Additional services may include the following: preparation of the interior design portion of a design-build Request for Proposal (RFP) package, including developing the FF and E requirements and budget for the project; verification of equipment and finishes during building construction; consultation during FF and E procurement, delivery, and installation; supervision of furniture assembly and placement; developing standards for FF and E for a program or group of projects; and other related consultation. 

Preparation of all interior design deliverables shall be in accordance with UFC 3-120-10, Interior Design.  FF and E specifications shall be based on Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP)  Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA), General Services Administration (GSA)  schedules, and other Federal contracts.

The types of buildings/facilities may include, but are not limited to, administration buildings, academic facilities, maintenance facilities, hangars, industrial/warehouse, bachelor enlisted/officer quarters, recreational facilities, dining facilities, medical facilities, laboratories, and consolidated clubs.
    

The maximum contract value may not exceed $5,000,000 aggregate total. The minimum guarantee for the contract is $5,000. The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial task order. The minimum value of individual task orders executed under this contract is $5,000. The maximum value of individual task orders executed under this contract is $400,000. There will be no dollar limit per year. Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates. Contract term is for a one-year base period with four option periods. Each performance period will run 365 (366 for leap year) calendar days.
 The hourly rates will be negotiated for each performance period. The Government may exercise the option period unilaterally. Per NFAS 17.208-100(c) (1), options for post-award services may be negotiated on individual task orders for unilateral exercise. The estimated start date is December 2016. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541410 (Interior Design Services) and the annual small business size standard is $7.5 Million.

The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. The contractor is not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. Firms that provided Architect-Engineer services for a task order issued under the resulting contract are prohibited from participating on the subsequent construction contract.
 This limitation also applies to subsidiaries/affiliates of the firm.  Firms or personnel shall not be affiliated with any furniture dealership, vendor, or manufacturer.

SELECTION CRITERIA AND SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: Selection of Architects and Engineers, formerly the Brooks Act (PL 92-582) and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6 selection procedures apply. The evaluation and selection will be based on the following criteria: Criterion 1, Professional Qualifications; Criterion 2, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence; Criterion 3, Capacity; Criterion 4, Past Performance; Criterion 5, Location and Knowledge of the Locality; Criterion 6, Quality Control; and Criterion 7, Volume of Work.
 Submitted SF330s (Architect-Engineer Qualifications) and related information will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm based on criteria responses. Criteria 1 and 2 are considered most important and of equal importance to each other; Criteria 3, 4, 5, and 6 are of lesser importance and listed in descending order of importance; and Criterion 7 is of lesser importance and will be used as a tiebreaker among firms considered technically equal.

Evaluation of past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being considered less favorably in the evaluation.
 In evaluating an Offerorâ€™s capability, the Government will consider how well the offeror complied with these instructions. All projects provided in the SF330 (Architect-Engineer Qualifications) shall have been completed by the office/branch/individual team member actually performing the work under this contract.

CRITERION 4, PAST PERFORMANCE: The evaluation will consider the Offerorâ€™s past performance on relevant Government and/or commercial projects regarding quality of work, cost control, compliance with performance schedules, and customer satisfaction, with emphasis on example projects presented in Section F.
 The evaluation will be based on past performance assessments and other available past performance information. Points of contact provided in the proposal may be contacted. Where there is no record of past performance, the proposal will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Superior performance ratings on relevant projects may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.

Submission Requirements: 
For projects provided as experience in Section F, list and provide copies of any applicable design awards received (copies are not counted in the 30-page limitation). Clearly indicate to which Section F project the award applies; otherwise the information may not be considered.

Submit an A-E Contractor Appraisal Support System (ACASS), Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS), or a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) evaluation for each project submitted under Criterion 2.
 If a completed ACASS/CPARS evaluation is available, it shall be submitted with the completed SF330 package. If there is not a completed ACASS/CPARS evaluation, the PPQ included with this notice is provided for the Offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project. If a PPQ is submitted, but an official ACASS/CPARS evaluation is found for that project in government databases, the official evaluation will take precedence. If an ACASS/CPARS evaluation is not available, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF330. If the A-E is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project before the response date set forth in this notice, the A-E should complete and submit with their response the first page of the PPQ (Attachment #1), including contract  and client information for the respective projects.
 A-Es should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If the client requests, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Governments point of contact, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest, Code RAQ20.EP, Attn: Elliott Penetrante, via email at elliott.penetrante@navy.mil, prior to the response date.

However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation. Submitted ACASS/CPARS and PPQ evaluations will not be counted as part of the 30 page limitation and shall be attached to the SF330, behind the SF330 Part II document(s).
 
CRITERION 5, LOCATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY: The evaluation will consider the teamâ€™s location, demonstrated knowledge of and project experience within the geographic areas where projects are anticipated for this contract.
  Due to the extensive coordination required with NAVFAC SW staff, prime A-E firms with a local office within 90 miles of NAVFAC SW headquarters in San Diego may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.

Submission Requirements: Submit a narrative that demonstrates the teamâ€™s knowledge of and project experience within the geographic locations for anticipated projects on this contract. The narrative shall address the following: 1) Location of the prime A-Eâ€™s main office and any branch offices and subcontractor offices that will be utilized for this contract; 2) Description of the teamâ€™s knowledge of, and project experience within, the targeted geographic areas; and 3) Description of teamâ€™s availability and ability to ensure timely response to requests for onsite support at Government installations throughout the NAVFAC PAC and SW AORs.

CRITERION 6, QUALITY CONTROL: The evaluation will consider the Offerorâ€™s Design Quality Control (DQC) program for ensuring technical accuracy and coordination of the A-E services.
 Firms that demonstrate a QC process that will minimize the governmentâ€™s quality assurance (QA) effort in reviewing the A-Eâ€™s work product may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.

Submission Requirements: Submit a narrative that describes the DQC program that the prime A-E firm uses to ensure technical integrity and accuracy of provided services. Identify the key personnel responsible for quality control.  The narrative shall address the following: 1) The QC program used by the prime A-E firm to ensure technical accuracy, effective coordination, and consistency of the A-Eâ€™s work product across the team (including subcontractors); 2) Process used for checking documents for coordination errors, omissions, conflicts, and discrepancies in the design/report documents; tracking changes and incorporating review comments; and 3) If multiple offices (prime and subcontractor) are included on the team, identify the office responsible for managing and coordinating the QC program and discuss the prime A-Eâ€™s methodology to ensure effective QC and communication between offices.

CRITERION 7, VOLUME OF WORK: The evaluation will consider the volume of DoD work awarded to the prime A-E in the past 12 months with the objective of equitably distributing contracts among A-E firms, including minority-owned firms and firms without prior DoD contracts.

Submission Requirements: State the dollar amount of work previously awarded to the firm identified in the SF330 as the Prime by DOD in the past 12 months.
 Joint Ventures (JV) should list awards to the JV entity and separately list awards to each individual JV member for the time period. Do not include work performed as a Subcontractor.

SELECTION INTERVIEW REQUIREMENTS: Personal interviews may be scheduled for firms slated as most highly qualified. Firms slated for interviews may be asked to explain or expand on information contained in their SF330 submittal. Elaborate presentations are not desired. Note that joint ventures (JV) slated for interviews will be required to provide a copy of their JV Agreement prior to the interview.

<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks Expressions of Interest (EoI) on game changing solutions to advance Universal Health Coverage in Bangladesh. The United States Agency for International Development Bangladesh's Office of Population, Health, Nutrition and Education (USAID/Bangladesh/OPHNE) invites organizations and companies to partner with USAID/Bangladesh to develop, test and scale-up health insurance coverage and other innovate health financing approaches in Bangladesh through the Smiling Sun (SS) health clinics to advance universal health coverage. This BAA will develop breakthrough solutions to expand access to safe, affordable and quality health services  in support of the GOB's National Health Care Financing strategy (2012-2032). The intent is to co-create, co-design, co-invest and collaborate on interventions that demonstrate the highest potential to dramatically improve health impacts by tackling key constraints within the existing NGO health delivery sector and health financing sector. Of particular interest are opportunities that complement USAID's strategic focus on science, technology and innovative partnerships (STIP), universal health coverage, ending preventable maternal and child deaths (including family planning and nutrition), and support the Agency's Mission to end extreme poverty.

If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the<br />Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will<br />remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue<br />the work not terminated.<br />d. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without<br />the fault or negligence of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to<br />perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />Examples of such causes include:<br />(1) Acts of God or of the public enemy<br />Modified 1 January 2015<br />(2) Act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity<br />(3) Fires<br />(4) Floods<br />(5) Epidemics<br />(6) Quarantine restrictions<br />(7) Strikes<br />(8) Freight embargoes<br />(9) Unusually severe weather<br />e. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the<br />NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br />(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information,<br />and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has<br />specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting<br />Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />f. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and<br />Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for<br />the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The<br />NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the<br />NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />g. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations<br />of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />h. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided<br />by law or under this contract.<br />i. This contract is automatically terminated for the convenience of the government in the event the NAFI is<br />dissolved.<br />14. CHANGES<br />a. The Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make<br />changes within the general scope of this Contract in any one or more of the following:<br />(1) If the requirement is for supplies and/or services: drawings, designs, or specifications; method of<br />shipment or packing; description of services to be performed; time of performance (i.e., hours of the day,<br />days of the week, etc.); place of delivery or place of performance of services.<br />(2) If the requirement is for concession services (including public private ventures): specifications<br />(including drawings and designs); method or manner of performance of work; NAFI-furnished facilities,<br />equipment, materials, services, or site; and/or directing acceleration in the performance of work.<br />(3) If the requirement is for transportation services: specifications; work or services; place of origin; place<br />of delivery; tonnage to be shipped; and/or amount of NAFI-furnished property.<br />b.

The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt<br />of the written order; however, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting<br />Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final payment of the Contract.<br />d. If the Contractor's proposal includes the cost of property made obsolete or excess by the change, the<br />Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.<br />e. If the requirement is for architect-engineer or other professional services, no services for which an additional<br />cost or fee will be charged by the Contractor shall be furnished without the prior written authorization of the<br />Contracting Officer.<br />f. If the requirement is for concession services (including public private ventures), the Contractor shall notify the<br />Contracting Officer in writing within seven (7) days of the occurrence of any event that the Contractor<br />considers a change to the Contract that has not been authorized in writing signed by the Contracting Officer.<br />The Contractor will be deemed to have waived any right to an adjustment if timely notice is not provided to<br />the Contracting Officer as required herein. For purposes of this clause, "event" shall include, but not be<br />limited to, an order or direction by a NAFI or other Government official, a contested contract interpretation,<br />interference with or interruption of the contract work, or any other event that increases the cost or time to<br />perform the contract as compared to the cost or time that would be required if the Contractor performed the<br />Contract in accordance with its terms.<br />g. Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a "claim" under either the "Claims" or "Disputes Resolution"<br />clause of this Contract; however, nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the<br />Contract as changed.<br />15.

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected.

<p>The Kenya Electricity Generating Company, Ltd. is a parastatal company with a Government of Kenya shareholding of 70% and 30% by private shareholders.  The Company is listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange. The Kenya Electricity Generating Company produces approximately 72 percent of the electricity consumed in the country and plans to triple its power generation capacity in the next ten years.</p>
<p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF STUDY COMPONENTS</p>
<p>The Feasibility Study will evaluate the technical and economic viability of the proposed Project and provide the data and analysis required to advance the development and financing of the Project. The Feasibility Study will review all relevant prior assessments completed to date; verify and update the assumptions, data, and analysis of these prior assessments; develop the conceptual design, cost estimate, and implementation schedule for the Project; conduct economic, financial, and risk analysis to determine the viability of the Project; conduct a full Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and obtain the necessary approvals from the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA); conduct detailed site investigations including geotechnical investigations and topographical survey; identify U.S. sources of supply; and prepare documentation necessary for the procurement of an engineering, procurement, and construction ("EPC") contractor; and identify suitable sources of funding for the project, preferably concessionary funding sources.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $998,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. This is a Request for Quote and the solicitation number is VA101-17-Q-0244. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. This solicitation (see attached file) is targeting only Service Disabled Veterans Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a portfolio of over 1,900 operational leases, approximately 1,500 of which are direct (i.e., via GSA Delegation) leases.  Each year, VA replaces, renews, or enters into hundreds of leases, in addition to the exercising of options, entering into standstill agreements, and other similar lease actions.  Changes to GSA Delegation policy provides that VA must secure delegation on a project by project basis and make use of GSA's GREX delegation system to do so.  This process involves the preparation of lease packages for internal VA approval, upload of various documents to GSA's GREX system (including scoring), and ultimately execution of the lease contract once delegation is received.  This process must be completed in compliance with internal VA policy requirements, GSA delegation requirements, and OMB A-11 Appendix B requirements.
The contractor shall be responsible for the following: maintaining and updating (SharePoint based tracker already exists) a tracking and reporting system on leases currently in process of receiving internal approval, delegation from GSA, or execution of lease contract; review of submitted lease packages to ensure compliance with internal approval, GSA, and OMB A-11 requirements including documentation and communication of any identified deficiencies; detailed review of each lease scoring to ensure proper scoring is done and a lease qualifies as an operating lease under OMB A-11; specific documentation and training material related to the lease delegation process, best practices, and scoring of leases and application of OMB A-11 Appendix B; enhancements to the existing SharePoint based tracking tool to include improved data validation, reporting, quality control, and security; update of VA's lease scoring model (Excelâ„¢ template already exists) and associated training material; general program support including meeting minutes.
OAEM, VA's Real Property Service (RPS), VHA, and other organizations will be responsible for package creation and interaction directly with GSA's GREX system.  Information on project status will come from the same sources; however, the contractor is responsible for the tracking and update of information provided by these various offices and ensuring the quality of the data in the lease tracking system.  The tasks are to support VA in implementing the new requirements as a result of the GSA Delegation policy change.  Tasks will not replace inherently governmental reviews of individual lease projects.
VA intends to acquire the services necessary to satisfy this requirement through limited competitive means - SDVOSB firm must complete 51 percent of the work. The complete solicitation document file is attached. All questions should be emailed to maina.gakure@va.gov by October 22, 2016 and a response to the questions will be posted by October 24, 2016 as an amendment to the solicitation. The associated NAICS code is 541611. This solicitation closes on October 27, 2016 at 10:00 am (EST). Point of contact is maina.gakure@va.gov. Interested contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and verified in VIP data base as SDVOSB

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>The U.S. Army is creating a library of high quality virtual 3D models (with all source data in the native authoring tool formats), henceforth "3D Models", for use in next generation simulations, training and gaming platforms in support of the Military Gaming Portal (MilGaming). MilGaming is an website with a broad community of interest for all U.S. military services, government agencies and their supporting contractors and affiliates to download game software and supporting content and share resources, knowledge and experience in support of modeling, simulation and training (MS&amp;T) programs.</p>
<p>The MilGaming 3D Model Purchase objective is to procure 3D models at the required specifications including source files from a 3D model vendor that will be hosted on a central library to support the modeling, simulation and training (MS&amp;T) needs of the MilGaming user community. 3D Models will be of the quality used in modern AAA game titles for use in next generation first person simulation, gaming, and virtual trainers that use various commercial game engines (i.e. VBS+, Unreal4+, and Unity5+).</p>

<p>The sample 3D model will be evaluated by the Government for conformance to the Product Specifications at Enclosure 1, and rated as acceptable or unacceptable. As part of the technical evaluation, Government studio measurements and tests may be used to determine compliance with all specifications. Standard software measuring tools will be used for quality check of model attributes to include file formats, scene organization, basic dimensions, scale, orientation, geometry and topology complexity and structure, texturing, UV use, and rigging. A sample 3D model failing the technical evaluation will be rejected, and both the sample and the proposal will not be considered further. Offering vendors that submit a sample 3D model that successfully passes the evaluation will continue with the full proposal evaluation.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest.

L. 113-235), Government agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.
(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information.
(c) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. <BR> <BR>Invoicing Procedures - Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (a)	Definitions.

(b)	Electronic Payment Requests.  Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, the contractor shall submit payment requests in electronic form.

DOL-BLS@quickpay.dol.gov
(c)	Data Transmission.  A contractor must ensure that the data transmission method and format comply with the following provisions:

(2)	The contractor MUST NOT: a.	Submit an invoice that exceeds the size limit of 16 megabytes (approximately 400-500 pages).

Inquiries regarding invoices should be e-mailed to BLSInvoiceInquiry@dol.gov.  The relevant invoice must be attached to the inquiry e-mail and the subject line of the e-mail must state ?INQUIRY,? followed by the information described in paragraph (1) d. above.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) requests information regarding: Industry's </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">interest, technical capability, and qualifications, as either a prime contractor or subcontractor, to meet the Government's need to procure</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: "> </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">towed electro-acoustic torpedo decoy systems. <br /></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />There is anticipated to be a full and open competitive procurement spanning FY2018 through FY2022 for twelve (12) months of development and first-article testing effort with four follow-on option years for production, and with potential deliveries extending out to FY2024.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />Background</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The current US Navy capability, known as the AN/SLQ-25 system (commonly referred to as Nixie), is a towed electro-acoustic decoy system with built-in redundancy that consists of: towed bodies, tow cables, an over-boarding system, electronics cabinet (with an integrated operator display), and remote operator display. </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The current capability is a standalone system that has been fielded on over 150 United States Navy ships and a similar number of foreign navy vessels.<br /><br /><br /></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The AN/SLQ-25 system employs an acoustic projector housed in each of two towed bodies which are attached to a dual drum winch via a tow cable. The tow cable and towed body are deployed and retrieved using an over-boarding system consisting of the dual drum winch, fleet angle compensators, deck sheaves and fairleads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A shipboard electronics cabinet provides signal processing capabilities and operator displays provide the man-machine interface for operational and maintenance functionality. The electronics cabinet hardware architecture has significant obsolescence issues; that cabinet and the towed body are strong candidates for redesign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other components have more stable architectures and may be built in the current configuration.<br /><br /><br /></span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The system, in particular the over-boarding system, has well established ship's interfaces for power, space and weight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, it is required that any new design stays within these constraints to minimize impacts to cost and schedule for new ship design and construction, as well as to allow for a more affordable approach to replacing in-service systems as part of the overall obsolescence resolution approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Proposed designs for either the electronics or the over-boarding system would be subject to the appropriate environmental qualification testing to ensure shipboard requirements are met.<br /></span></p>

<DESC>This is an INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT by Fleet Readiness Center Western Pacific (FRCWP) for aviation maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) services in support of United States Navy H-60 aircraft. This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. The planned industry day will serve as a market research tool, both for informing industry of United States Government (USG) requirements for H-60 MRO services and for determining industryâ€™s interest, awareness and capabilities for providing those services. The industry day forum will allow for networking among interested service providers and lead to USG awareness of industryâ€™s capabilities for supporting the H-60.
 Aviation MRO service providers will have the opportunity to learn about FRCWPâ€™s mission and to meet with contracting personnel from Fleet Readiness Center Yokosuka (FLCY) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). Attendees will be provided a draft copy of the Performance Work Statement for the upcoming H-60 PMI requirement and will be given an opportunity for providing feedback on that document. FRCWP will host its industry day on 17 November 2016 at NAF Atsugi, Japan.

FRCWP uses USG contracts with MRO service providers to support aircraft maintenance. In general, requirements consist of integrated maintenance plan (IMP) and in-service repair (ISR) support. FRCWP is particularly interested in identifying potential service providers for its upcoming H-60 IMP and ISR support requirements.
 Participants wishing to attend the conference who do not possess the proper documents for access to NAF Atsugi must advise the USG during the reservation process. Additional instructions for accessing the industry day location will be provided at the time reservations are received. FRCWPâ€™s industry day will be held on 17 November 2016, beginning at 13:00 and ending at 16:00 JST. There will be limited availability for one-on-one sessions after 16:00 for interested service providers. The one-on-one sessions will be held in 15-minute intervals by appointment only. If questions arise during the one-on-one sessions that cannot be answered in person, those answers will be published on Asia NECO after the event.

Advance registration for this event is required.
 Parties interested in attending FRCWPâ€™s industry day and the one-on-one sessions shall submit a reservation request via email to Mr. Kurt Dronenburg at kurt.dronenburg@fe.navy.mil or to Mr. Seiji Yoshino at Seiji.yoshino.ja@fe.navy.mil. Requests shall include the companyâ€™s name, the names and titles of participating individuals, and contact information to include telephone numbers and email addresses. Participating companies are further requested to provide CAGE and NAICS codes if available. There are no site visit tours scheduled for this event. No more than two participants per company may register. 

All registrations must be received no later than 14:00 JST on 2 November 2016. 

Vendors are responsible for securing their own lodging and food during this event.

<DESC><p>OAKS BOTTOM RESTORATION PROJECT: <br />This is not a solicitation. This Sources Sought Announcement is for the purpose of identifying firms which are capable and interested in offering a proposal for the following project:<br />The Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge is a 160-acre park with diverse habitats including an extensive floodplain located along the east bank of the Lower Willamette River at approximately River Mile 16 in southeast Portland, Oregon. The project area is within the 100-year floodplain of the Willamette River, which is within the tidal zone of the Columbia River. The Willamette River merges with the Columbia River approximately 16 miles downstream of the project site. Daily freshwater tidal fluctuations typically range up to 2.5 feet in the project area. Oaks Bottom offers a unique opportunity for a large, natural, tidally influenced floodplain and wetland area to be restored in the heart of the city. The purpose of the proposed action is to restore a more natural tidal hydrologic connection between Oaks Bottom and the Lower Willamette River, improve diverse fish and wildlife habitats, reduce non-native species populations, and provide unhindered fish passage into and out of Oaks Bottom. A number of restoration measures were considered during the plan formulation process undertaken in this Feasibility Study and evaluated based on their potential benefits to fish and wildlife and costs. The recommended restoration plan includes the following elements:</p>
<p>&bull; Replacement of the culvert under the railroad berm with a 16-foot by 10-foot culvert,<br />&bull; Removal of the water control structure,<br />&bull; Excavation of tidal slough channels to connect to the reservoir and southern ponds,<br />&bull; Removal of invasive species,<br />&bull; Revegetation with riparian and wetland species along the channels and around the perimeter of the reservoir and southern ponds, and<br />&bull; Placement of two viewing platforms adjacent to the Springwater Trail.</p>

<DESC>HSCGG1-17-B-PFA003 <br />ISSUE DATE: 18 OCTOBER 2016
<p>Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to completely remove and replace existing deteriorated steel lintels with new galvanized lintels that will be painted before installation, match existing steel lintel size. New lintels shall be reinstalled loose and not fastened to structure. Re-point the entire fa&ccedil;ade of the building from the eave to the grade with sand and lime mortar matching the original construction. Remove and recycle or properly dispose of all construction debris.</p>
<p>Project includes replacing the exterior steel lintels above all windows and doors serving the exterior of the building and the building addition at the east or rear of the main Hamilton Hall building. The original building was constructed in 1930 and has had a series of renovations through the years. Replace the exterior steel lintels over all window openings and door openings including the garage door at the basement level of the main building. This includes replacing the lintels over the window openings at the main building addition on the East/rear of the main building (Henriques addition). Existing brick at the lintels will be removed to access the lintels and a clear written and digital photograph assessment of the existing lintels will be conducted prior to actual removal of lintel. The project includes a base bid requirement and one Option item.</p>
<p>Base bid requirement is to completely remove existing lintels and replace with correct size. New lintels shall be galvanized, primed with appropriate primer and painted with two coats of exterior paint. On a case by case basis, if it is determined that actual replacement is not required, an alternative method can be proposed to mitigate lintel oxidation. New lead coated copper flashing shall be installed at all lintel locations. Lintel end dam flashing shall be installed at all locations to eliminate water ponding and wicking at ends of steel lintels. New adhesive backed membrane flashing shall be installed. Cut old mortar joints out to a minimum depth of one inch deep. Remove all deteriorated mortar that is deeper than the one inch minimum initial cut in the joint. If mortar removed reaches half the brick width or deeper then brick shall be completely removed and reset in new mortar bed. All spalled and cracked face brick shall be replaced. Make preps for new grout to be installed, including the removal of all foreign and loose material from the joints. If water is used to clean the joints ensure adequate time is allowed for joint area to dry before placing new mortar. Mortar shall not be harder than the brick and shall be of a sand and lime mixture. Use of scaffolding will require an engineered plan for the erection and stabilization of scaffold for use on site. The engineered plan shall be stamped by the certifying engineer. There are items attached to the outside face of the building at various locations. These items shall be removed and reinstalled once the repointing in that area is complete. Use shoring as required to keep items from shifting out of place. Base bid contains approximately 10724 square feet of surface area and 69 window and door openings.</p>
<p>The option requirement breaks up the square footage and number of openings to be completed within that option. Option &lsquo;C' (Option 1) is a concentrated area of replacing only the lintels at the Arch windows on the rear addition to Hamilton Hall Henriques addition. Only repoint immediate area around the window opening as required. Included in option are 10 arch openings and the replacement of two limestone sills. Repair of the windows and frames is part of this option. Windows shall be repaired to normal working order. Remove all old joint sealant and replace with new. Remove and recycle or properly dispose of all construction debris.</p>
<p>The lintels, window openings and doors, frames, trim, etc. are based on the original building drawings, historic photographs, field measurement of original components and current code requirements. New lintels shall be galvanized and then primed for two coats of paint before installation. All windows shall be thoroughly cleaned on the exterior prior to removal of scaffolding. Replace all joint sealant at the exterior of all openings. Electrical lighting fixtures and loud speaker system shall be removed and reinstalled. Surface mounted conduit shall be removed for mortar joint accessed. Conduit that is oxidized shall be replaced with galvanized conduit. Existing downspouts and scuppers shall be removed and reinstalled at existing locations.</p>
<p>General Requirements: All work shall be done by licensed contractors and shall comply with current codes and contract documents. Contractor shall provide 72 hour notice of any required shut downs.</p>
<p>Performance Period: Estimated construction time for the base requirement is a total of 8 weeks on site, with 2 weeks for scaffold erection and dismantling. Estimated construction time for the Option is a total of 4 weeks on site with 2 weeks for scaffolding. It is anticipated that award will be made on or before 31 Dec 2016, and on-site performance is expected to begin 22 May 2017 (after Graduation). It is anticipated that all work will be completed ooa 3 August 2017.</p>
<p>The estimated value of the procurement is between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00. Solicitation packages will be available on 18 October 2016. The date set for receipt of bids is scheduled for 17&nbsp;November 2016 at 2:00 pm.

VA makes no progress payments during the design or construction/build-out phases of the project.

				Office of Acquisition Operations
				Strategic Acquisition Center
				10300 Spotsylvania Avenue, Suite 400
				Fredericksburg, VA  22408

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for cleaning equipment and supplies, chemicals and services, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6, "Limited Sources."  The required items are supplied by Divine Imaging Inc., a Small Business, located at 21323 Pacific Coast Hwy Suite 101, Malibu, CA 90265-5202. These items will be procured via the VA Federal Supply Schedule (GSA) GS-07F-0462W to populate the MSPV-NG formulary with mandatory health care supplies.  The MSPV-NG formulary is a list of approved healthcare commodities including medical, surgical, dental, laboratory, facilities/cleaning products, and textiles.   This LSJ will supply the MSPV-NG formulary with cleaning equipment and accessories distributed by Divine Imaging Inc. on a not-to-exceed 12-month period of performance until these items can be competed in accordance with FAR 8.405-3.  As the identified required items are competed, they will no longer be acquired under the LSJ; thus, bringing the MSPV-NG formulary in compliance with the FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements".

3.  Acquisition History:  VHA manages the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.  In 2013, the system consisted of 21 Veterans Integrated Services Networks with approximately 150 medical centers, 820 outpatient clinics, and various other facilities to include Community Living Centers, Veteran Centers and Domiciliaries .  Together, these health care facilities, and the more than 53,000 independent licensed health care practitioners who work within them, provide comprehensive care to about 9.3 million enrolled Veterans.  The MSPV Program is the primary means to obtain medical and surgical supply support for the VA healthcare system through contract support.  VHA, in cooperation with VA's National Acquisition Center (NAC), initiated contract support for the MSPV program in 2005.  The result was the first generation of seven prime vendor distributor contracts that not only support VHA, but also support the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of State, Indian Health Service, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

Since that time, VHA and NAC have successfully executed two long-term, multiple-award 5-year contracts in support of the MSPV program.  In 2015, upon expiration of the second MSPV program, a set of bridge contracts were executed by the NAC extending the period of performance to April 19, 2016.  Those bridge contracts were as follows:  VA797N-15-C-0003, VA797N-15-C-0004, VA797N-15-C-0005, VA797N-15-C-0006, VA797N-15-C-0007, VA797N-15-C-0008, and VA797N-15-C-0009.  

In preparation for the continuation of the MSPV Program, the Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) assumed responsibility to award the new MSPV-NG contracts in 2014.  Due to a protest and continued technical evaluations, the SAC Contracting Officer determined that a second set of bridge contracts would be required to ensure continuity of services and the continuance of healthcare support throughout the VA community beyond the bridge contracts' expiration on April 19, 2016.  In February 2016, the SAC awarded the second set of bridge contracts.  They are as follows:  VA119-16-D-0007, VA119-16-D-0008, VA119-16-D-0009, VA119-16-D-0010, VA119-16-D-0011, VA119-16-D-0012, and VA119-16-D-0013.  The period of performance for the second SAC bridge contracts began April 20, 2016, and will expire no later than April 19, 2017.

Leveraging the NAC's lessons learned, VHA and SAC developed a procurement strategy for a complete VA-wide MSPV formulary of approved supplies by April 2016.  To execute this plan, VHA and SAC formed a team in February 2015, to initiate development of the MSPV-NG formulary.  The goal of this team was to solicit and award approximately 7,000 individual line-items, identified as an optimal initial level, for the pending MSPV-NG formulary.  The team developed a streamlined approach to solicit and award these items, which involved VHA providing salient characteristics for all 7,000 line-items, and SAC awarding competitive BPAs based on those salient characteristics.  

Between April 2015 and January 2016, VHA forwarded to SAC approximately 4,400 individual procurement packages consisting of both single and multiple line-items, of which approximately 3,500 were solicited and 900 returned to VHA for inclusion in future grouping efforts.  Although SAC issued multiple Requests for Quotations (RFQs), vendor response rates averaged less than 30 percent.  Due to lack of response, SAC and VHA sought input from industry via a series of MSPV-NG Industry Days.  When queried, industry partners indicated two main problems: (1) VHA's salient characteristics were flawed and/or insufficient.  They did not appear to be based on clinical input, and often cited unnecessary manufacturer-specific features.  This prohibited timely and quality responses, or no responses at all in many cases; (2) Industry also indicated the administrative burden of providing quotes for single-item BPA awards was not cost effective enough for them to provide quotes. 

In order to obtain a better success rate, and work on completing new MSPV-NG contracts, two possible strategies were identified:  (1) VHA created supply-line commodity teams, and began seeking clinical input for the development of salient characteristics.  Additionally, logical commodity groupings were developed; and (2) moving forward, VHA's Program Management Office was to group line-items by supply-line categories, or by United Nations Standard Products and Services Codes.  Supply-line categories were found to be the most favored by industry.  In an effort to validate this, a Request for Information (RFI) was issued to industry in February 2016.  The RFI results confirmed the supply-line category approach as the most appropriate method to solicit BPAs for item inclusion in the approved formulary.  

On February 24, 2016, awards were made to four MSPV-NG distributors, with an estimated performance starting 120 days after notice to proceed.  The period of performance under these contracts are scheduled to begin on October 20, 2016.  It was anticipated the distributors would have a full-line of 7,000 competitively awarded BPA formulary line-items to populate their electronic catalogs (e-catalog).  Due to lack of vendor response, the formulary fell short of the necessary items required to complete the Prime Vendor's e-catalog.  In an attempt to resolve the shortfall identified above, numerous changes in VA's strategy for populating the formulary were considered.  This directly resulted in the need to establish additional MSPV bridge distribution contracts to ensure continuation of service.  The MSPV bridge contracts were awarded with a start date of April 20, 2016.  This included a 3-month base period of performance, and three 3-month option periods.  The final period of performance expiration date is not-to-exceed 12 months.  

4.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The MSPV-NG formulary will consist of two tiers:  1) the 1,600 line items previously competed by the SAC and NAC, which is being automatically populated into the MSPV-NG formulary and estimated to be ready for use by October 20, 2016; and 2) the additional VA FSS items identified by VHA to be procured under this LSJ.  This group includes the cleaning equipment and supplies, chemicals and services distributed by Divine Imaging Inc.  Examples of items covered under this category include various types of cleaning equipment and accessories, cleaning products for daily cleaning and products that keep facilities clean. The item covered under this LSJ is as follows: 

Part Number	Item Description	Estimated Quantity 
30824	WIPE DISINFECTANT HYDROGEN	
6,936

The reprieve offered by this LSJ will allow VHA to continue placing orders under the MSPV-NG contracts on a temporary basis, and avoid an interruption in the healthcare supply chain while SAC pursues competitive procurements for the MSPV-NG formulary items.  

The proposed types of cleaning equipment and supplies, chemicals and services will be ordered under the authority of this LSJ.  These items have been identified as high-use medical items vital to the successful implementation of the MSPV-NG program.  VHA analyzed the fiscal year (FY) 2015 Medical Products Data Bank, focusing on the top high-volume purchases and identified critical cleaning equipment and supplies, chemicals and services distributed by Divine Imaging Inc.  Until the MSPV-NG formulary is completed, VHA's ordering officers will be allowed to place orders for the required cleaning equipment and supplies, chemicals and services.  The anticipated total value of the proposed BPA over the life of the agreement is $60,262.80. The period of performance is not to exceed 12 months.  

5.  Statutory Authority and Supporting Rationale:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), an urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 

6.  Rationale Supporting the Authority Cited Above:  Urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect the interest of the Government will not permit competition in accordance with FAR 8.405-3, "Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs)". Significant adverse consequences will occur if the LSJ is not approved as the VA health care supply chain will be negatively impacted. Continuance of the MSPV Distribution Program is vital; any delay of distribution will directly impair the delivery of healthcare and services to approximately 9.5 million Veterans currently receiving care through the VA Healthcare System. A break in the health care supply chain will hinder or halt the delivery of essential medical, surgical, dental, and laboratory supplies and other contracted medical/surgical, cleaning, rescue and safety supplies and services used in the direct delivery of patient care.  

The VA Healthcare System receives approximately 40% of its medical and surgical supply support through the national MSPV Program.  Many of these items are standardized throughout the VA Healthcare System, and are a part of the formulary being developed for use in the VA. The formulary drives efficiency and familiarity in clinical practice which leads to improved patient outcomes and safety. It also decreases variation, thus reducing time to train and results in fewer errors when providing care. Standardization provides healthcare system benefits that are maximized because standardized items are interoperable. Facilities can then reinvest the savings earned into equipment and personnel that further enhance patient care.

Estimated cost reduction for purchase of individual items through the MSPV formulary is approximately $4M over the course of the twelve months proposed under this LSJ. The $4M estimate does not account for efficiencies in the ordering and inventory management processes. Overall annual inventory reduction specifically attributable to MSPV is estimated at approximately $40M.  

Disapproval of the LSJ will result in a disruption in the health care supply chain and negate these potential savings as facilities source supplies through other means.  Workload, man-hours, and cost of operations will increase as already depleting resources are lost and the agency will revert to the inefficient means of sourcing medical supplies as before the introduction of the national MSPV program in 2005.  Those inefficient methods include use of purchase cards and local VHA contracting.  

Use of purchase cards as an ordering method has shown to be more than 5 times the workload burden of using the delivery order method under the MSPV program.  In addition, there is approximately 2000 contracting staff in VHA, processing 576,134 formal contracting actions annually.  If the MSPV Ordering Officers were unable to place orders via MSPV, and those transactions were added to the workload of an already overburdened contracting staff, the result would be catastrophic.  

Lead times to procure these items through contracting for other than emergency orders are 45 days; emergency orders require action within three days.  All orders would become emergencies to ensure timely delivery of healthcare to Veterans.  Canceled surgeries due to lengthy supply lead times would possibly become the norm, and thus, adversely affecting timely access to care.  Items critical to provide immediate care will be jeopardized, and will directly impact the safety and lives of Veterans.  

VA has a critical role in the comprehensive emergency response to support local, regional, or national emergencies or disasters.  VA is charged with the delivery and coordination of support missions for VA facilities affected by disasters, and also performs missions assigned to VA by FEMA or US Dept. of Health & Human Services for response to and recovery from nationally-declared emergencies and disasters.  The Prime Vendor Program is critical to ensure VA provides a full range of support to healthcare facilities to ensure resiliency, continuity and rapid recovery of healthcare services during disasters and other potential disruptions to healthcare service delivery.  VAMCs and other select Federal facilities are designated Federal Emergency Medical Facilities with significant contingency and emergency response roles.  Accordingly, the MSPVs provide emergency supply support during major catastrophic events.  Any interruption in the health care supply chain significantly jeopardizes the ability of VA to ensure minimum disruption to delivery of critical services in a contingency situation. This would directly impact healthcare delivery to our nation's Veterans.

Other alternatives were considered, including using both the legacy bridge contracts, and the MSPV-NG contract concurrently until all of the required items can be competitively awarded.  The confusion this would create in the field is insurmountable, as field staff will face the uncertainty of which contracts to use and when.   A well-coordinated supply chain is necessary to ensure facilities are supported, and Veterans are cared for timely.  There are no reasonable alternatives that would adequately address the circumstances presented. Any financial costs incurred by the Government to execute the BPAs under the authority of the LSJ, and any potential costs or cost avoidance not realized through competition would not outweigh the benefits received through continuance of the health care supply chain. Approval of the LSJ is in the best interests of the Government and is justified by the urgency of the circumstances. 

The cost to the Government if the LSJ is not approved would not be primarily financial, although it is significant. The non-monetary costs of the health, welfare and safety of millions of Veterans cannot be quantified.  Every effort was made to compare these costs, benefits and other options; the VA cannot rationally find any other reasonable or timely alternative.

VA considered the cost to the integrity of the procurement system and VA acknowledges the importance of protecting the integrity of the procurement system. However, VA feels this is an extraordinary situation, and maintains that due to an already constricted schedule, and the significant impact of these BPAs on the delivery of medical and surgical supplies and services to millions of Veterans, the facts of this case justify the unusual measure proposed under this LSJ.  VA considered the balance of the integrity of the procurement system, and the interest of the Government and determined that the issuance of the BPAs under the authority of this LSJ is mitigated and justified.  A break in the health care supply chain will be costly and detrimentally disruptive to VA operations and delivery of critical healthcare services to 9.5 million Veterans. Items procured under the authority of this LSJ will be included in the MSPV supply chain for a maximum period of twelve months until the item can be competitively awarded.  At such time the item will be removed from the supply chain and replaced with the competitively awarded functional equivalent.

This action is vital to support VA's nationwide healthcare system and prevent disruptions to Veteran care.  The identified medical items represent supplies collectively determined essential by VHA medical centers to meet VA patient care needs.  Continued use of these products and source of supply will ensure timely delivery and minimize VA supply chain interruptions.  The vendor for these items was selected through use of data analytics tools and the Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB).  

The MSPV-NG program is the primary means to obtain medical supplies; these items are regarded as critical to patient care.  These items are currently available under the legacy MSPV contracts.  Failure to make them available under MSPV-NG would have catastrophic effects on the field's ability to support medical centers.  Each item would have to be purchased individually either via purchase card, or through local VHA Contracting Offices, with lead times of up to 45 days.  VHA Logistics and Contracting do not have the capacity to meet the constant throughput of high cost/high volume daily individual orders required to meet clinical care needs.  Bottlenecks resulting from capacity issues would result in insufficient inventory to meet critical needs for Veteran patients, and will have a significant patient safety impact.  It is imperative that VA transition from the present way of doing business under the current MSPV program to the new and revised mandatory MSPV-NG program.  In executing this change the following improvements will be realized:

a.	The MSPV-NG distributors shall not ship any medical/surgical or any other supplies that are not on the Government-provided MSPV-NG formulary of approved medical/surgical supplies.
b.	The MSPV-NG distributors shall not charge any VA formulary approved suppliers to handle their product in conjunction with the contract.
c.	The Government mandates all distributors to be Electronic Data Interchange compliant and it is in the BPAs/contracts. 
d.	The MSPV-NG distributors shall not require product suppliers to carry liability insurance in excess of $1,000,000, charge tracking fees, and/or require additional discounts from product suppliers.
 
7.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  MSPV-NG distribution contracts were awarded on February 24, 2016, and performance is scheduled to begin on October 20, 2016.  The MSPV-NG distributors require VA's formulary in order to fulfill the medical requirements at VA hospitals and clinics.  As stated previously, the Government intends to compete all line items within the next 12 months.  Market research shows there is adequate competition in support of the new requirements.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 8.405-6(a)(2), these actions will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO).  

8.  Determination of Best Value:  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d), the prices for supplies offered on FSS have already been determined to be fair and reasonable by NAC Contracting Officers.  Given VHA's critical need for the previously identified formulary supplies, and the short turn-around time until the MSPV-NG formulary is fully implemented, VA intends to select the lowest published FSS vendor and seek additional discounts.  To compete these items would result in unacceptable delays, and potential mission failure.  In the future, additional discounts will be sought through competition for these products as part of the transition to the MSPV-NG formulary.  

9.  Market Research:  The market research conducted for the MSPV-NG requirement showed there are multiple suppliers capable of providing medical products however; performance is required by October 20, 2016, and VA does not have adequate resources for timely completion of the required items. VA has a need to have consistent, uninterrupted sources of supply that meets system-wide requirements without compromising direct patient care to VA medical centers and/or related facilities.  VA has a plan to compete these items and market research supports this acquisition strategy.  

10.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:  SAC is currently establishing competitive single-award BPAs that are beginning to populate the MSPV-NG formulary.  Competition is on-going; however, at the onset of MSPV-NG's period of performance, the formulary will not have sufficient breadth of medical products to meet the operational needs of VA.  It is anticipated the MSPV-NG distributors will begin accepting and delivering orders on approximately October 20, 2016, for all items covered in this LSJ. 

11. Actions to Increase Competition:  As described above, VA will compete future requirements and continuously add necessary products to the MSPV-NG formulary.  SAC will work with VHA's program office to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions.  VA has and will continue to meet with industry on a periodic basis for continued input and feedback on acquisition strategies.  All future acquisitions of MSPV-NG BPAs will be solicited and awarded in a manner that promotes competition to greatest extent practicable. 

?

12.  Determination of Best Value:  I hereby determine that the proposed contract action will represent the best value to the Government consistent with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A).

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY
   
1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Acquisition Operations
      Technology Acquisition Center
      23 Christopher Way
      Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

2.	Description of Action: This proposed action is for a firm-fixed price delivery order to be issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC). for brand name RSD America software maintenance for VA, Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), Service Delivery and Engineering, Enterprise Operations (EO).  

3.	Description of Supplies or Services: VA, Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), Service Delivery and Engineering, Enterprise Operations (EO) has a requirement for the procurement of brand name RSD America, software maintenance and support.  The software maintenance will consist of software upgrades and updates to include major releases, point releases, service releases and security releases of applicable software on a quarterly basis or within 48 hours in cases in which a high risk vulnerability fix becomes available.  This software maintenance and updates are necessary for EO to be able to operate successfully.   The period of performance is for a 12-month base period and two 12-month option periods.  The total estimated price of the proposed action is $ inclusive of options.   

4.	Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C 4106(c)(2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled, "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."

5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited: This is a brand name justification in support of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it was determined that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for the brand name RSD America, software maintenance and update support as described in section 3 of this justification.  The current EO infrastructure is based on existing RSD America software and VA requires support compatible with the existing infrastructure protocols and functionality for continued operational availability.  VA requires software upgrades and updates to include major releases, point releases, service releases of applicable software on a quarterly basis, or within 48 hours in cases where a high risk vulnerability fix becomes available.  Only RSD America or an authorized reseller can provide the necessary software updates, because of the propriety source code required to develop and implement software updates.  No other source is capable of providing the required software maintenance that meets VA's unique functional requirements.  In addition, a prior implementation of RSD America, software licenses already exists in EO.  Acquisition of a different product, even if another one existed with qualifications that met VA's stated functional needs, would require multiple support costs if the RSD America, software licenses were abandoned in favor of a different product and EO would need to re-purchase the initial software licenses previously purchased.  No other license is compatible with or interoperable with the existing RSD America, proprietary database structures, protocols, and software application programming interfaces. The brand name RSD America software maintenance is the only software maintenance that meets the Government's requirements.

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research paragraph of this document. This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  It was determined, however, that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for this brand name software maintenance.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), this action will be synopsized and the justification will be made publicly available on the Federal Business Opportunities Page within 14 days of award of the order.  
 
7.	Actions to Increase Competition: The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the marketplace that would enable future actions to be fully competed. 

8.	Market Research: RSD America is a commercially available off-the-shelf software license package currently in use in VA.  Market research was conducted in June 2016 from the Government's technical experts by reviewing similar software products to ascertain if these items could meet VA's requirements.  Specifically, the Government's technical experts conducted web-based research on web sites such as Exago Inc. and Rocsoft.  As a result of the market research the technical experts confirmed that as the source code required to issue the updates is proprietary, RSD America is the only source capable of providing the required maintenance and upgrades for RSD America software. No other firm has the capability of developing and issuing software updates and fixes for RSD America software necessary to support existing EO requirements.  All of the products researched were unable to meet the functional requirements as stated in paragraph 5.  Based on the above, only RSD America software licenses and maintenance meets all of the Government's requirements.  

9.  Other Facts: N/A
 
10.  Technical and Requirements Certification: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Acquisition Operations
      Technology Acquisition Center
      23 Christopher Way
      Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

2.	Description of Action: This proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price task order to be issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC).

3.	Description of Supplies or Services: VA, Office of Information and Technology, Service Delivery and Engineering, Enterprise Operations (EO) has a requirement for maintenance and support of International Business Machines (IBM) products that are only available under IBM's Passport Advantage (PPA) Agreements program.  The software maintenance and support will consist of software upgrades and updates to include major releases, point releases, service releases, and security releases of applicable software on a quarterly basis, or within 48 hours in cases in where a high risk vulnerability fix becomes available.  The software upgrade and updates are necessary for EO to continue to operate successfully.  The period of performance is 12 months, and the total estimated price of the proposed action is $XXXXXXX.   

4.	Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."

5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited: Based on extensive market research, as described in section 8 of this document, it was determined that limited competition is available for the aforementioned IBM PPA software maintenance and support.  The current EO infrastructure is based on existing IBM software product lines acquired under IBM's PPA program and VA requires support compatible with the existing infrastructure protocols and functionality for continued operational availability.  It is critical that this infrastructure remain operational at all times and maintenance and support services be continuously available.  Only IBM's PPA Division or an authorized reseller can provide the necessary software updates, because of the proprietary source code required to develop and implement software updates.  No other source is capable of providing the required software maintenance that meets VA's unique functional requirement.  In addition, current IBM software licenses were purchased through the IBM PPA program and have been installed and integrated into EO's IBM mainframe customer service packages.  Replacing the existing software by purchasing new software, would require onsite installation and configuration of the new software and re-training of all VA information technology support staff.  The new software would also have to meet the qualifications of VA's stated functional needs, and would require multiple support costs if the IBM PPA software licenses were abandoned in favor of a different product.  No other license is compatible and interoperable with the existing IBM PPA proprietary database structures, protocols, and software application programming interfaces.  The IBM PPA software maintenance and support is the only software maintenance that meets the Government's requirement.

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), this action will be synopsized within 14 days of award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page.  In addition, the Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity shall be posted to NASA SEWP V GWAC website along with the solicitation.
 
7.	Actions to Increase Competition: In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to continue to perform market research to ascertain if any other sources can provide these services in the future.  Although the Government is limiting competition as a result of specifying brand name items, there are multiple authorized resellers of the required brand name items on the NASA SEWP V GWAC.  Limited competition among these vendors is anticipated.

8.	Market Research: Market research was conducted in June 2016.  The Government's technical experts reviewed similar service providers to determine if the current IBM PPA software being utilized in VA can be supported by other service providers.  Specifically, the Government's technical experts conducted web-based research on Luxoft and Silicus products.  As a result of the market research, the technical experts confirmed that due to proprietary nature of the source code, IBM PPA is the only source capable of providing the required maintenance and support of the software.  IBM PPA product line is software maintenance that covers multiple software packages currently in use in EO.  No other service providers have the capability of developing and issuing software updates and fixes for the software necessary to support existing EO requirement.  Based on the above, only IBM PPA software maintenance and support meets all of the Government's requirements.  In addition, a Request for Information (RFI) was issued on July 22, 2016 by utilizing the NASA SEWP V GWAC web portal to identify interested sources capable of providing the required maintenance and support.  The RFI resulted in submission from two vendors .  Both vendors proposed maintenance and support for brand name IBM PPA software, meeting the minimum requirement.  Furthermore, NASA SEWP has a dynamic catalog where line items can be added based on customer requests; therefore, as long as the required item or service is within scope of the NASA SEWP V GWAC, items and services can be added to the catalog on a daily basis.  This requirement was determined to be within scope of the NASA SEWP V GWAC under a separate determination.  Therefore, VA anticipates limited competition.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY
   
1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Acquisition Operations
      Technology Acquisition Center
      23 Christopher Way
      Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

2.	Description of Action: The proposed action is for a firm-fixed price task order to be issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for Hewlett Packard (HP) Autonomy software maintenance and support. 

3.	Description of Supplies or Services: VA, Office of Information and Technology, Service Delivery and Engineering, Enterprise Operations (EO) has a requirement for brand name HP Autonomy software maintenance and support.  The software maintenance and support will consist of software upgrades and updates to include major releases, point releases, service releases and security releases of applicable software on a quarterly basis, or within 48 hours in cases where a high risk vulnerability fix becomes available.  This software maintenance and support is necessary for EO to continue to operate successfully.  The maintenance is required to ensure the software remains operational.  The period of performance shall be 12-month base period plus two, 12-month option periods for maintenance and support, if exercised.  The total estimated price of the proposed action is $XXXXX, inclusive of options.

4.	Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."  

5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited: Based on extensive market research, as described in section 8 of this justification, it was determined that limited competition is available among authorized resellers of brand name HP Autonomy, software maintenance and support.  The current EO infrastructure is based on existing HP Autonomy software and VA requires support compatible with the existing infrastructure protocols and functionality for continued operational availability.  Only HP Autonomy or an authorized reseller can provide the necessary software maintenance and support, because of the propriety source code required to develop and implement software updates.  Furthermore, access to the proprietary source code is required to ensure the software maintenance and support is properly configured to the software. No other source is capable of providing the required software maintenance that meets VA's unique functional requirement.  In addition, a prior implementation of HP Autonomy, software licenses already exists in EO.  No other license is compatible with or interoperable with the existing HP Autonomy, proprietary database structures, protocols, and software application programming interfaces.  The brand name HP Autonomy software maintenance and support is the only software maintenance that meets the Government's requirement.

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), this action will be synopsized and the justification will be made publicly available within 14 days of award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page.  In addition, the Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity shall be posted to NASA SEWP V GWAC website along with the solicitation.
 
7.	Actions to Increase Competition: The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the marketplace that would enable future actions to be fully competed.

8.	Market Research: HP Autonomy is a commercially available off-the-shelf software license package currently in use in VA.  Market research was conducted in July 2016 and the Government's technical experts reviewed similar software products and software maintenance and support to ascertain if these items and services could meet VA's requirement.  Specifically, the Government's technical experts conducted web-based research on Lavastorm and Netezza data analytics software maintenance.  As a result of the market research the technical experts confirmed that as the source code required to issue the updates is proprietary, HP is the only source capable of providing the required maintenance and support for HP Autonomy currently in use within EO.  No other firm has the capability of developing and issuing software updates and fixes for HP Autonomy software necessary to support existing EO requirements.  The other software maintenance solutions researched are unable to meet the requirements.  Based on the above, only HP Autonomy software maintenance and support meets all of the Government's requirements.  

In addition, a Request for Information (RFI) was issued on July 27, 2016 by utilizing the NASA SEWP V GWAC web portal to identify interested sources capable of providing HP Autonomy products.  The RFI resulted in responses from three vendors, as such VA anticipates limited competition for this effort.

9.  Other Facts: N/A
 
10.  Technical and Requirements Certification: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Project Manager				Signature: ______________________

11.  Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:  I hereby determine that the anticipated price to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable based on the expectation of adequate price competition.  In addition, pricing for products awarded on the NASA SEWP V GWAC have already been determined to be fair and reasonable and only more competitive pricing may result.  Price analysis will also be conducted; through a comparison of the successful quote received with the Independent Government Cost Estimate.

12.  Procuring Contracting Officer Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  As this contract action does not exceed $650,000, the certification below required by FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(C)(1) serves as approval.
