<CONTACT>MELISSA W. GILL CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487368     mgill@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) anticipates entering into non-competitive negotiations with Microsoft Corporation for a short-term contract to develop documentation and manuals that allow for the operation and maintenance of the TerraServer, provide uninterrupted operations and maintenance of the TerraServer until award of a competed follow-on contract, and assist the government in the transition of the TerraServer from Microsoft to a competitively selected vendor.  The TerraServer Web site was developed by Microsoft and partners through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between Microsoft and the USGS and is one of the world's largest online databases, providing free public access to a vast data store of maps and aerial photographs of the Unites States using USGS data and information.  Microsoft, as the developer of the TerraServer, has unique knowledge of the design, implementation and operation of the system including, but not limited to, interactions and interfaces of the various software packages, special software developed to integrate the system, software developed to crop, compress and mosaic data for efficient Internet access, and hardward architecture.  The USGS believes Microsoft is the only source that can meet the USGS requirements stated above.  Firms who believe they can provide these services are invited to submit an affirmative response by e-mail to Melissa Gill (mgill@usgs.gov) within 45 days of the publication date of this notice in accordance with Numbered Note 22.  All such responses will be evaluated in order to determine whether the firm can meet the requirements.  An affirmative response shall include narrative that clearly demonstrates the capabilities of the interested party.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.  See Numbered Notes 22.

<DESC>Defense Sciences Research and Technology; SOL: BAA03-02; POC: Dr. Steven G. Wax, DARPA/DSO; FAX: (571) 218-4553; WEB:http://www.darpa.mil/baa/; E-MAIL: BAA03-02@darpa.mil.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND FUNDING.  The mission of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency?s (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop those technologies into important, radically new military capabilities.  To this end, DSO is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below.  Proposals may be either basic or applied research.  However, in all cases, proposers should demonstrate that their proposed effort is aimed at high-risk/high-payoff technologies that have the potential for making revolutionary rather than incremental improvements to national security, including emerging threats and operational challenges.  Proposals that are not within the topical areas described below may be considered out of scope and not evaluated.  Likewise, proposals that are not research, but rather integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered out of scope and will not be evaluated.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.  While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposers include a Phase I of no more than 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success.  This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.  TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS OF INTEREST TO DSO.  This section describes the general technical interests of DSO.  However, the ultimate success of a proposal is based on the specific technical idea(s) advanced within these areas and especially the uniqueness of the proposed approach.  Consequently, proposing within one of these topic areas is not sufficient to make a compelling case for funding.  For this reason white papers are strongly suggested before submitting a full proposal.  (See below)  New Materials, Materials Concepts, Materials Processing and Devices: Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Biomaterials and biomimetic materials; Engineered materials (meta-materials); Fracture phenomena and prognostics; Femtosecond Laser Diodes and Optical Amplifiers; Functional materials (ferroelectric, magnetic, etc.); Materials and concepts for advanced (beyond silicon) electronic materials and devices; Materials and concepts for power generation and energy storage at all scales; Materials and structures for quantum information processing; Materials and structures for spin transport and control; Multifunctional (structure + function) materials; Non-destructive evaluation, property/life prediction and related technologies; Novel approaches for materials discovery, processing or manufacturing and insertion; Optical materials; Self-healing, -sensing and -adapting materials; and Smart materials and structures. Advanced Mathematics: Application of advanced mathematics to problems of interest to the Department of Defense (DoD): Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Computational geometry and topology; Dimensionality reduction, error propagation and uncertainty management in databases, models, and experiments; Electromagnetic modeling and simulation; Fast, scalable scientific computation; Quantum information science; Sensor management; Signal and image processing; and Virtual materials development, processing, and evaluation. Biological Warfare Defense: Technologies to render biological warfare attacks against the U.S. military harmless:  Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Advanced medical diagnostics; External protection (clothing, masks, etc.) for soldiers; Medical countermeasures against both known and unknown pathogens; Protection, decontamination of materials and equipment; Remote detection / characterization of biological substances; Self-decontamination concepts; and Sensor technology.  Applications of Biology to Defense Applications: Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Accelerating the healing response of tissue; Approaches for controlling biological systems; Approaches for enhancing human performance; Biodynamics and Biological Complexity; Bio-inspired systems; Biomaterials/bioprocessing; Biomolecular motors and devices; Cell and tissue based biosensors; Hybrid biotic/abiotic systems; Human performance enhancement (including training) technologies; Investigation of the behavior of biointerfaces; Novel mathematical and computational approaches to characterizing and simulating complex biological processes; and Understanding sensory cognitive mechanisms affecting spatial orientation. Special Focus Areas.  From time to time, DARPA will publish addenda to this BAA that will highlight particular areas of interest.  It is highly recommended that potential proposers look periodically for these updates.  Any specific instructions or criteria in a published addendum will take precedence over this BAA in response to that addendum only.  Due to the expected large volume of interested parties, it will not be possible for DARPA to establish a distribution list for automatic distribution of these addenda.  Other Technical Areas: Ideas outside of the advertised focus areas will be considered in scope only if the proposers can demonstrate that they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the technical interests of the office.  Proposals that integrate existing technologies or products into systems generally do not fall within the purview of the Defense Sciences Office and are likely to be rejected.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION AND DEADLINES.  Proposals may be submitted at any time until the final proposal deadline of 4:00pm ET 7 November 2003.  Proposals will be evaluated against the criteria set forth in this solicitation and within 30 days of receipt an offeror will be notified either that: 1) the proposal has been selected for funding; 2) the proposal has not been selected for funding; or 3) the proposal is still under review and an estimate of when this review will be completed will be provided.  Proposers may elect to have their proposal withdrawn from consideration at any time during the evaluation process.  If a formal request is not made, DARPA will assume that continued evaluation is desired.  One copy only of proposals that are not selected for funding will be retained for administrative purposes.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  The Government also reserves the right to fund proposals in phases with options for continued work at the end of one or more of the phases.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or "Other Transaction," depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors.  The offeror must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the Government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS Part 227).  White Paper Submissions.  Before proposers put together a full proposal it is highly recommended (though not required) that they submit a white paper in response to the BAA.  This white paper should clearly state the uniqueness of the idea presented in the context of existing state-of-the-art in the technical area of interest.  Demonstrating that the proposer has a clear understanding of the state of the art and that the proposal will make significant improvements therein is essential for a successful proposal.  The white paper should also describe the proposed approach and explain why it is unique.  Further, the proposer should demonstrate an understanding of the payoff of the technical idea, especially in terms of how it might make a difference to Defense capabilities.  Key milestones expected in the effort should be described.  Also, a brief discussion of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members should be provided.  Finally, an estimate of the program costs and duration should be included.  White papers should not be longer than 8 pages; however, shorter white papers that can cover the content above are strongly encouraged.
Procedures have been put in place that will help proposers to rapidly determine the applicability of their proposal to DARPA/DSO and to help develop promising ideas into formal proposals with a reasonably high probability of funding.  A website http://www.sainc.com/dso/ has been set up to facilitate the submission of white papers.  This site will allow the filling in of contact information and the uploading of a white paper document in (format).  It will provide a method by which proposers can track their submissions.  White paper submissions may also be made by attachment to an e-mail sent to BAA03-02@darpa.mil (Word 97 or higher is recommended).  Embedded text and Postscript are also acceptable.  Note: if the website is not used, then the body of the e-mail AND the attachment must include name, mailing address, phone number, and fax of the proposer.  If this information is not contained in the body, the e-mail will be returned for inclusion of that information.  (If proposers choose not to use e-mail, U.S. mail may be used.  White papers will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.)  Within two weeks of receipt of the white paper, the proposer will be informed of receipt of the white paper, provided a proposal log number and given both a technical and administrative point of contact.  The formal recommendation about whether a formal proposal is recommended will be made as soon as possible.  However, the exact time for response will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the number of white papers received.  Please note, this recommendation is for the benefit of the proposer and is not a guarantee that the full proposal will be funded.  All full proposal submissions will be evaluated regardless of the disposition of the white paper.  White papers may be submitted at any time.  However, proposers should leave sufficient time for technical interactions before the due date of the full proposals, November 7, 2003.  FORMAT AND CONTENT OF FULL PROPOSAL.  Full proposals shall consist of two volumes, technical and cost.  Offerors should submit one (1) original and three (3) copies of the full proposal to the address shown below.  For full proposals, facsimile transmissions or electronic media transmissions will not be accepted.  All pages shall be printed on 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper with type not smaller than 12 point and a minimum of one and one-half spacing.  This includes the type on figures and charts.  Copies of up to three papers referenced in the proposal may be included with the submission, but will be read at the discretion of the reviewers.  Proposers are cautioned not to count on these papers in meeting the evaluation criteria described below.  All other supporting materials including videotapes and CDs submitted with the proposal will be disregarded.  Volume 1: Technical.  The technical volume is limited to a maximum of 30 pages including all figures, references, tables, charts, cover sheet, and appendices and consists of the following sections: (a) Executive Summary (two pages or less); (b) Technical section that clearly describes the innovation of the work to be accomplished, specific metrics for the effort, the risks to achieving those metrics and approaches for mitigation of those risks.  All milestones should be clearly delineated, especially those early (first year to 18 months) milestones that are critical to demonstration of the concept or approach.  Supporting rationale for performance enhancements should be included.  The perceived need for this research and the potential impact on the DoD should be described, and a Statement of Work (SOW) that summarizes critical tasks to be accomplished should be presented; (c) Time-phased schedule-milestone chart; (d) Summary of relevant prior work; (e) Brief description of applicable facilities and equipment; (f) Short resumes of key individuals.  The level of effort and specific roles and qualifications of key individuals should be included.  If the team is large (greater than 3 separate entities) a management plan for coordination of the effort should also be included; and (g) Current and pending support (award title, amount, period of performance, degree of overlap with this proposal.)  Volume 2: Cost.  The cost volume shall contain the following: (A) Cover sheet to include: (1) BAA number; (2) Technical area; (3) Lead Organization Submitting proposal; (4) Type of business, selected among the following categories: "LARGE BUSINESS," "SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS," "Woman Owned Business," "Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business," "OTHER SMALL BUSINESS," "HBCU," "MI," "OTHER EDUCATIONAL,? or "OTHER NONPROFIT," (5) Contractor?s reference number (if any); (6) Other team members (if applicable) and type of business for each; (7) Proposal title; (8) Technical point of contact to include: salutation, last name, first name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available), electronic mail (if available); (9) Administrative point of contact to include: salutation, last name, first name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available), and electronic mail (if available);  (10) Award instrument requested: cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF); cost-contract--no fee; cost sharing contract--no fee; or other type of procurement contract (specify), grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction; (11) Place(s) and period(s) of performance; (12) Total proposed cost separated by basic award and option(s) (if any); (13) Name, address, and telephone number of the offeror?s cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) administration office (if known); (14) Name, address, and telephone number of the offeror?s cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit office (if known); (15) Date proposal was prepared; and (16) DUNS, TIN, CAGE CODE.

(C) Supporting cost and pricing information in sufficient detail to substantiate the summary cost estimates in B. above.  Include a description of the method used to estimate costs and supporting documentation.  Note:  ?cost or pricing data? as defined in FAR Subpart 2.101 shall be required if the offeror?s proposal is for a procurement contract award of $550,000 or greater unless the offeror requests an exception from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data.  ?Cost or pricing data? are not required if the offeror proposes an award instrument other than a procurement contract (e.g., a grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction).  The requirements for submission of ?cost or pricing data? are specified in FAR Subpart 15.403-4 (see http://www.arnet.gov/far).  Other Relevant Information for Proposal Submission.  Teaming and Team Composition.  Teaming is encouraged, especially when interdisciplinary approaches to a problem are required.  Proposals may include, or be led by, foreign firms and/or personnel provided all export control laws and U.S. national security requirements are adhered to in the conduct of the effort and that the work relating to the foreign firm or personnel is unclassified.  The onus of understanding and complying with export control rests with the proposer, not the Government.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and to join others in submitting proposals.  Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  Consequently, all offerors and proposed subcontractors must, therefore, affirm whether they are providing scientific, engineering and technical assistance (SETA), or similar support, to any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract numbers.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined at FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  Technology Transition.  Proposers are strongly encouraged to engage commercial and military end-users and commercial manufacturers from the program inception.  The engagement of these communities also helps ensure that the various technologies being developed will be commercially viable (cost effective, manufacturability, etc.) and available to the military.  Thus, proposals are strongly encouraged to include/involve the user-community that intends to bring the technology to practice as a result of this research.  This relationship encourages the participation of researchers, end-users and manufacturers as collective contributors to the technology definition, implementation, and performance evaluation.  Proprietary Information.  All proprietary information should be marked on both the white paper and the full proposal.  It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.  Standard proprietary disclaimers notwithstanding, proposals may be reviewed by non-Government technical experts who have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with DARPA, unless the specific phrase ?TO BE REVIEWED BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ONLY? appears on the cover sheet.  In any case, personnel under exclusive contract with DARPA who have completed the appropriate nondisclosure agreements will handle the proposals for administrative purposes.  Security.  Proposals and white papers may contain classified information or data (up to the level of Top Secret/SCI).  Offerors that intend to include classified information or data in their proposals above DoD SECRET should contact DARPA security at the address identified in this BAA (or alternatively, the point-of-contact for this BAA) for guidance and direction in advance of proposal preparation.  DO NOT SEND CLASSIFIED WHITE PAPERS BY EMAIL.  Offerors must have existing approved capabilities (personnel and facilities) to perform research and development at the classification level they propose.  EVALUATION CRITERIA.  The following evaluation criteria are listed in order of decreasing importance.  Proposals that are considered less than satisfactory in Scientific and Technical Merit will not be evaluated further.  Scientific and Technical Merit.  Proposers must demonstrate that their proposal is innovative and unique, that the technical approach is sound, that they have an understanding of critical technical issues and risk and that they have a plan for mitigation of those risks.  A significant improvement in capability or understanding above the state of the art must be demonstrated.  All milestones must be clearly and quantitatively described.  Value to Defense.  Proposers must demonstrate the potential of successful research to radically change military capability or improve national security with a clear statement of the goals of their program and a quantitative comparison with existing technology.  Capability of the Personnel and Facilities to Perform the Proposed Effort.  Proposers must demonstrate that their team has the necessary background and experience to perform this project.  The balance of the technical capabilities of the team must match that required in the program plan.  The relevant experience of key personnel must be sufficient to provide confidence that the proposers can accomplish their objectives.  Proposers must demonstrate that the combined facilities of the team are sufficient to accomplish the objectives of the proposal.  Cost Realism.  Costs of the proposal must be reasonable and provide a high value to the Government.  ADMINISTRATION.  Address for Submission of White Papers or Full Proposals (Except Classified Proposals): DARPA/DSO, ATTN: BAA03-02, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714.  Web address for White Paper Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso/.  Guidance for Classified Information and Data.  Proposers should contact the Contracting Officer for information on security or for instructions for the submission of a classified proposal.

<CONTACT>O Wayne Koger, 256-955-3947
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command's (USASMDC's Missile Defense and Space Technology Center (MDSTC) Test and Evaluation Directorate has a requirement for continued Infrared Instrumentation System (IRIS) Mission Support, Operations, and Mainten ance (IMSOM) work until a competitive (small business set-aside) can be completed to provide a follow-on to the current contract. The competition is underway but is not expected to be completed and the effort fully transitioned to the new contract until 31 MAR03. During the period following depletion of remaining level-of-effort hours under the current IMSOM contract and prior to 31MAR03, several critical flight tests are scheduled that require IMSOM services to provide critical optical test data and interce pt verification data necessary to meet demonstration validation program requirements.  To bridge this gap, USASMDC plans, pursuant to 10 U.S. Code 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, to award a contract modification to continue IMSOM effort under existing Contract  DASG60-95-C-0077 on a sole source basis with the incumbent IMSOM contractor, CACI/Automated Sciences Group (ASG), Inc., 1100 N. Glebe Road, Silver Spring, MD 22201. This effort continues the prior work of ASG, which developed the IRIS and which has operat ed and maintained the IRIS under various sole source and competitively awarded contracts since its inception.  The modification will add approximately 20,000 level-of-effort (LOE) hours and extend the period of performance of the contract by six months.  I t has been determined that award of these additional hours to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered by competition.  This action will provide the continued availability of highly s pecialized services relating to operation of the Infrared Instrumentation System (IRIS).   The IRIS sensor is installed on a contractor-leased and substantially modified Gulfstream IIb aircraft that conducts airborne optical measurements on targets of inte rest to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), USASMDC, Program Executive Office for Air and Missile Defense (PEO-AMD), and other government users. The IRIS is a unique, three?color, cryogenically cooled, imaging, infrared sensor system providing optical data c ollection coverage in a variety of infrared wavebands.  The objective of this effort is to provide technical analyses of mission test requirements with respect to IRIS measurement capabilities, mission planning support for mission conduct and range coordin ation, sensor and aircraft integration activities, IRIS operations and maintenance to support data collection, reduction and analysis of that data to provide infrared signatures along with an assessment of its impact to theater and strategic ballistic miss ile systems, and improvement and modernization of the IRIS and associated equipment.  These activities will be conducted at the contractor facility and/or CONUS/OCONUS test ranges.  A TOP SECRET facility clearance and a SECRET safeguarding capability is re quired for this effort.  Written responses must cite the synopsis number for this notice and be submitted to the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, ATTN: SMDC-CM-AK/Mr. Wayne Koger, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801. See note 22.

<CONTACT>Henrietta Mosley, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 366-9570, Fax (202) 366-9555, Email hmosley@nhtsa.dot.gov
<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to negotiate with FTI/SEA Consulting Inc., Columbus, Ohio for Static Stability Factor (SSF) Measurements of model Year 2003 light duty vehicles in the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP).  NHTSA has a need for accurate center-of gravity (CG) height and track width measurements on a selection of approximately 80 light vehicles for the purposes of determining SSF of each vehicle.  FTI/SEA can provide testing and measurement services that meet the exacting accuracy and repeatability requirements that NHTSA has determined are necessary in our efforts to address highway safety problems of light vehicle rollover.  FTI/SEA has in place the equipment and procedures to meet the technical requirements and schedule.  FTI/SEA has recently completed SSF measurements for the 2001 and 2002 NHTSA NCAP program. The services that NHTSA currently requires are of exactly the same type as those provided by FTI/SEA in the 2001 and 2002 programs except that test vehicle loading conditions may be different and, for some tests, vehicle acquisition may not be required (i.e., some test vehicles will be provided to the contractor by the Government).  Static Stability Factor is a key determinant of a motor vehicle's resistance to rolling over in crashes.  Whereas rollover crashes are a large proportion of serious crashes on the nation's highways, especially fatal ones, the Agency desires to quantify vehicle design characteristics that influence the likelihood of rolling over.   Furthermore, since some types of vehicles roll over at a higher rate than others, the Agency may decide to provide ratings based on Static Stability Factor to consumers as a basis for comparing the rollover resistance of new vehicles, and potentially influencing consumers' purchase decisions.  In quantifying vehicle rollover resistance, the Agency focused on certain static or quasi-static metrics, including SSF, Critical Sliding Velocity, and Tilt Table Ratio.  Some of these metrics required that CG height of a vehicle be a known quantity.  Since CG height is a vehicle dimension that cannot be directly measured, the Agency developed a test fixture for that measurement called the Inertial Parameter Measurement Device (IPMD) which consisted of a suspended platform capable of holding a vehicle. In its basic design, the IIPMD is a pendulum which can be rotated through a small deflection angle by the application of a known torque.  By geometric analysis, the torque and deflection angle could be used to derive the test vehicle CG height.  The system included elements for measuring a vehicle's roll, pitch, and yaw inertia, and also a set of scales for measuring weight at each wheel of a test vehicle.  Successive versions of the IPMD were developed, each being an improvement on the previous version, with the goal being to measure CG height as accurately as possible.  After five versions were constructed, the IPMD fixture was disassembled, and is no longer available for use.  Eventually, the private sector took over the development effort.  FTI/SEA's test fixture is similar to the IPMD developed by the agency, but with further refinements and enhancements.  The FTI/SEA system called Vehicle Inertial Measurement Facility (VIMF) is a state-of-the-art testing mechanism with increased structural rigidity, a more robust and simplified vehicle restraint mechanism with known inertial properties, and a software driven control and data acquisition system that hastens and simplifies CG height measurement.  Most importantly, the design and construction of the VIMF was preceded by a thorough theoretical analysis of the sources of error present in pendulum-based CG height measurement systems.  The results of the analysis were used in the design and construction of the VIMF and accounted for in its operation. The contractor shall obtain test vehicles by renting or leasing or by another business arrangement at the contractor's discretion.  Test vehicles shall be procured at the contractor's expense.  If specified, the contractor shall obtain one of each of the vehicle make/models selected by the Government. Each vehicle shall be new or in as-new condition (e.g., dealer demo).  The contractor shall be responsible for all aspects of acquisition of test vehicles for the performance of this contract, including transportation, taxes, registration, warranties, paperwork, tolls, fuel, maintenance and any and all associated costs.  The contractor shall prepare each vehicle for testing and measurement.  For the NCAP ratings, the contractor shall determine the Static Stability Factor (SSF) of each test vehicle in a driver-only loading configuration.  Each test vehicle shall have an anthropomorphic test dummy or a similar device in the driver seating position.  Interested firms must show that they have the capability to meet the work requirements.  Oral expressions of interest will not be considered.  Written expressions of interest must include sufficiently detailed information to demonstrate that interested firms have, or have access to, the requisite equipment and facilities to conduct the required testing/measurements.  This information shall also demonstrate that the interested firm has the necessary professional qualifications and relevant experience.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  In the absence of responses from interested firms demonstrating their capability, NHTSA intends to request a proposal from FTI/SEA on a noncompetitive basis for the work described.  Responses must be received by the listed procuring office within 15 calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.  It is contemplated that an Indefinite Quantity-Fixed-Price Type Contract will be awarded for this effort.  The anticipated period of performance is a Base Year of twelve (12) months with four (4) additional twelve (12) month option periods.

<DESC>Contact Person:  Carol Watkins, GSA Contract Specialist, 816-823-4906; fax 816-823-5523.

The purpose of this source selection procurement is to select a quality Design-Build Services contractor for Roof Replacement (IMO23015) at Federal Building 1, Bannister Complex, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri, Solicitation Number GS06P02GZC0539.  The contractor selected will be responsible for taking the scope and performance documents (prepared by an architect/engineer) through design and construction.  The estimated cost of design and construction for the design-build contract is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The contract length shall be proposed by the Contractor and approved by the Government, but shall not exceed 15 months (450 calendar days) after Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about May 6, 2003.  This procurement will be completed using a two-step source selection process. This contract is restricted only to those firms having an existing general construction contracting office in one of the following four states:  Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska, and such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this announcement.

Building 1 consists of a basement and a ground level.  There have been numerous incidences of leaks in tenant space, with the possibility of severe damage to tenant property due to roof leaks.  Building 1 of the Bannister Federal Complex is primarily used for warehousing and has a concrete barrel-vaulted roof structure.  The roof is in poor condition and in need of complete replacement.  The total project size is approximately 641,980 square feet.  The building roofs are built-up modified bitumen of various compositions.

The scope of work includes the following:  1)  Replacing the approximately 641,890 square feet of existing roof over GSA controlled space; and 2) Increasing the roof system from an approximate average R-value of 9 to an R-value of 26.  Asbestos contaminated material is on the roof, and any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed after regular business hours.

The request for technical proposals (RFTP) solicitation will be issued on or about January 15, 2003.  All requests for the RFTP must be in writing.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the Bid Documents.  Those requesting drawings, plans, and/or specifications must provide valid identification in the form of one of the following:  a business license; DUNS number, or valid state driver?s license.

A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on or about January 23, 2003 at the GSA Office, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri.  GSA will receive proposals on or about February 13, 2003.  Date and time will be specified in the RFTP.  Only one proposal will be submitted by each offeror.

The Government will use the ?greatest value? concept in selecting the prime contractor.  This concept is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  Proposals will be evaluated in two phases.  Phase I will be technical evaluations of proposals to establish those within a competitive range.  Phase II will be receipt of pricing and scheduling, which will only be received from those firms short-listed under Phase I technical evaluations.  The short list will be published in FedBizOpps at www.FedBizOpps.gov, on or about March 17, 2003.  Phase I technical proposals will be evaluated using the following technical factors, in descending order of importance:  1)  Past performance of the firm; 2) Management plan; 3) Qualifications of key personnel; and 4) Team composition, organization and prior experience as a Design-Build team.  For this solicitation, technical quality is more important than cost or price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  

Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  This is a negotiated procurement that will result in a firm-fixed price contract.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval. 

Prior to award of the contract, the contractor, if not a small business will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established subcontracting goals of 40% total for Small Business (SB), which includes 8% for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB); 5% for Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), 2.5% for Hub Zone Small Business; (HZSB); 5% for Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB); and 3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  Contact Carol Watkins, Contract Specialist, to request the RFTP and for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4906 or fax her at 816-823-5523.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, George Gourse, at 816-823-2262.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a Sole Source Cost-Plus-Incentive Fee/Cost-Plus-Award Fee requirement to The Boeing Company, 3370 Miraloma Avenue, Anaheim, CA., under authority from FAR 6.302.  The Sole Source is justified under FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  The award is for the design, development, fabrication, and test of one Engineering Development Model (EDM) that has the Long-term Mine Reconnaissance System Pre-planned Product Improvements (LMRS P3I) incorporated into the baseline design.   The award will be a modification to the existing contract N00024-00-C-6103 with The Boeing Company.  The Navy originally competed the AN/BLQ-11 Long-term Mine Reconnaissance System (LMRS) Development, which was awarded to Boeing, Anaheim, CA on 1 November 1999. The LMRS P3I is intended to incre ase the performance of the baseline LMRS by providing precision bottom mapping capability, in-stride mine detection and avoidance capability, enhanced acoustic classification resolution, increased acoustic classification range, and improved data rate and/or range of acoustic link between host SSN and UUV.  The current LMRS P3I requirement will be based on the Boeing System Critical Design. The LMRS program has successfully completed the Development Phase Critical Design Review (CDR), where a Product Baseline (PBL) was established and is presently conducting initial Developmental Testing. This PBL includes all the specifications, product drawings and commercial drawings required for production. The LMRS P3I will be required to meet nearly all LMRS System Requirements and over 80% of the PBL for LMRS can be reused in the LMRS P3I. In accordance with the Commander, Naval Sea Syste ms Command mandate for evolutionary acquisition and spiral development, all design efforts, documentation and plans presently completed or in process for LMRS in regards to performance, reliability, supportability, training, technical manuals, safety (including SUBSAFE certification), environmental compliance and total ownership cost (TOC)/life cycle costs (LCC) will be easily transferable or applicable to the LMRS P3I. The request for proposal is anticipated to be released in March 2003 with an anticipated contract award on or about in July 2003.*****

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst plans to release draft solicitation N68335-03-R-0015 on or around 3 Feb 2003 for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD)of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) .
 
The Navy defines EMALS as four major subsystems:  an energy storage subsystem, a power conditioning subsystem, a launch motor subsystem and a launch control subsystem.   Program goals include the ability to increase the launch performance envelope and reduce installed weight, volume and manning workload requirements over current steam catapults.  
  
EMALS is being conducted as a multi-phase procurement.  The program started with a Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) Phase synopsized in July 1999 (CBD Submission No. 349470). Both General Atomics of San Diego, California and Northrop Grumman of Sunnyvale, California received awards for the PDRR phase of the program. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase will be awarded based on a limited competition between these two companies.

Basis of award for the EMD solicitation will be Best Value evaluation.  Award criteria for the EMD solicitation will include demonstrated completion of specified PDRR requirements with full scale, fully integrated EMALS hardware.  The Government will choose one concept resulting in a final, militarized version of the EMALS.    

The purpose of the draft solicitation is to promote early exchanges of  information about acquisition strategy and feasibility of the requirement. The formal RFP is expected to be released, under an approved J&A, during the July 2003 timeframe, and will be  synopsized prior to release.  The Government intends to issue a new, formal solicitation for the subsequent production phase  which will follow the EMD phase.  
 
The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this notice nor will the Government compensate any respondent for costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  Any comments provided may not necessarily be included in a formal solicitation.  

The draft RFP contains data subject to the Export Control Act.  This information may only be released to individuals or enterprises that have been certified by the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC).  It is requested that any interested parties submit a request for the draft RFP and a current, completed and certified DD Form 2345 with their request to NAWCAD Lakehurst Contracts Office , Attn: C. Montgomery (fax number (732) 323-7408  or  (732) 323-4069.

<DESC>This requirement is to provide the Department of Commerce (DOC) and other Government Agencies with a select range of Engineering (AE) services, primarily focusing on commissioning for new facilities, and recommissioning of existing facilities.  The contract will consist of a 12-month base period from the date of contract award and four, 12-month option periods. Services will be implemented through individual task orders, with a total contract amount not to exceed $9.5 million over the five-year contract life. The AE shall provide the personnel, equipment, and materials needed to support the Government in its responsibilities of providing the commissioning efforts of projects or programs for its worldwide facilities.  It is anticipated that the primary emphasis of the effort accomplished under this contract for commissioning shall fall in the technical discipline areas of mechanical engineering (including but not limited to HVAC, plumbing, fire protection, DDC), electrical engineering (including but not limited to UPS, emergency generator, lightning protection, fire alarm systems), and specialty items (including but not limited to voice/data, telecommunications, security, CCTV). Other technical disciplines (examples:  environmental, geologist, value engineer, etc.) could be required to a lesser degree.  The AE  (herein referred to as the Commissioning Agent or CA) shall provide professional engineering, and consultation services (i.e., commissioning/ recommissioning) related to resolving problems in the implementation and construction of Government facility projects and programs for current and other fiscal years.  The CA shall be NEBB (National Environmental Balancing Bureau) Certified. The commissioning and recommissioning work may include such items as review of other AE design and construction documents, review of other AE value engineering proposals, review of other AE cost estimates, verification of construction contractor's efforts during construction, review and investigation of construction contractor's cost proposals for proposed changes, engineering and architectural design and review, and some engineering during construction.  The AE will also provide services for building maintenance planning services, system component training, construction warranty inspections, and follow-up inspections of facilities after construction is complete. The following items are indicative of the types of work to be accomplished and are not intended to be inclusive but only representative. Facility Commissioning and Recommissioning:  Commissioning is the systematic process of ensuring that all building systems are designed and will perform interactively according to the Client's project requirements and operational needs. Recommissioning is the process by which the original Client's project requirements, existing facility systems, present operating requirements, present load conditions, and available solutions are evaluated according to current operations and reconciled for the most efficient and effective operation. Facility Commissioning Design Phase:  The Commissioning Agent (CA) will serve a vital role in assisting with the flow of information between the Client, the Project Manager and the design team.  With this process, the Client can be sure that specific objectives and expectations have been conveyed to and understood by the design team.  The CA will also play a vital role in providing recommendations and assistance to the design team in reviewing and commenting on the Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) design components, and Value Engineering proposals.  Throughout the design, the CA will work with the design team to ensure that each system component is selected to meet the design requirements, and incorporated into the overall design documents.  The CA will also work with the designer to ensure that the construction specifications include the appropriate commissioning responsibilities required of the construction contractor and all appropriate functional testing procedures required of each system to be installed.  Construction Phase:  During construction, the CA will work to ensure that each component is installed correctly, and operates to meet the performance requirements of the design.  The CA will review and provide applicable comment during the review of shop drawing submittals, review of Client/contractor/AE proposed change orders, review of Request For Information (RFI) from the contractor, Non-Compliances issued to the contractor, observation of the equipment installation, and assisting with start-up of major systems and components.  The CA will be responsible for preparing and presenting a "Draft" Commissioning Plan to the COTR. The plan shall take full cognizance of all design intent and specific requirements as outlined in the Contract Documents.   The "Draft Commissioning Plan" shall include: 1) Establishment of a "Commissioning Team" during construction.  The Team shall include the Client, the project designers, the construction contractor, (and key subcontractors, i.e., General, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, Sheet-metal, and Controls contractors). The CA will chair over this team of individuals. 2) A summary of each system element to be commissioned, each commissioning procedure to be executed, all documentation required for the final commissioning report and responsibilities for delivering each element of the commissioning plan. 3) The draft-commissioning plan shall include specific procedures required of the contractor (and as outlined in the specifications) for each system to be commissioned.  The procedures will include: a) Purpose of the procedure, b) Acceptance criteria, c) Method of testing d) Instrumentation required, e) Report requirements. 4) Commissioning Schedules and priorities. 5) Documentation requirements and format (checklists for recording inspections, startup, functional performance tests, unit capacities, installation and operations instructions, etc.). 6) Format and program for training Client's Operating and Maintenance personnel. The contract type will be an indefinite delivery order contract to support federal facilities nationwide. All work must be accomplished by or under the direct supervision of licensed professional Architects and/or Engineers. Many designs will be required to be in metric dimensions.  A strong emphasis on "green" design and construction under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program and principles will be included in all projects. It is a requirement that the proposing firm and consultants have, as a minimum, electronic mail service for the purpose of accomplishing contract progress reviews, coordination, transmission of electronic files, and day-to-day communications. Selection criteria in descending order of importance are as follows: (1) Past performance on contracts for commissioning with government agencies and private industry in terms of quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. For the last ten completed projects identify the type of construction contract, give number and value of construction change orders; give the project schedules (design and construction) with scheduled completion versus actual completion; and provide letters of recommendation and federal agency performance evaluations. Identify both a project client and an end-user point of contact with current phone numbers and email addresses for each project. Referenced projects should not be more than five years old. (SF 254, paragraphs 10 and 11, and SF 255, paragraphs 8, 9, and 10, plus supplemental information.) (2) Professional qualifications and experience necessary for satisfactory performance of required services in reviewing designs for laboratory and research facilities, multipurpose office facilities, restoration and renovation of existing facilities, and facilities in coastal and arctic environments; preparing studies and analyses; performing cost estimating and value engineering and performing engineering during construction. Firms should provide specific information on key personnel for such projects. (SF 255, paragraph 7.) (3) Capacity of the firm to accomplish the work in the required time. Capacity to accomplish a large, multi-disciplined, sophisticated design effort within specific time limits. Number and types of disciplines on in-house staff. Identify plan for reacting to changes and staff augmentation. Identify subcontractors to support secondary disciplines. (SF 254, paragraph 8, plus supplemental information.) (4) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required. Experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to each project, to include skills in commissioning, engineering, cost estimating, computer-aided drafting, project coordination, construction management, inspection. (SF 254, paragraphs 10 and 11, and SF 255, paragraphs 4, 7, 8, and 9.) (5) Project Manager's experience and qualifications to lead multi-disciplined project teams. Demonstrate professional registration/certification; identify years and experience with the responding firm, years and experience in leading a multi-disciplined design team on multiple, simultaneous projects, and experience managing Indefinite Delivery Order contracts. (SF 255, paragraph 7.)  (6) Subcontracting plan (use of small, women and minority owned business)  (7) Proximity and ability to communicate with engineers at the NOAA Central Administrative Support Center (CASC) in Kansas City, MO. (SF 255, paragraph 10). Submittal Requirements: To be considered, interested firms must provide three submittal packages consisting of an original SF 254 and an original SF 255 no later than 3:00 p.m. CST on January 21, 2003. Offerors must provide adequate documentation in blocks 7g and 10 of SF 255 to illustrate the extent of participation of groups in terms of the percentage of the total anticipated contract effort. All responding firms must also include a completed SF 254 for themselves and their consultants. Proposing firms are responsible for supplying information concerning each evaluation factor.  A minimum of three firms will be Short- Listed and invited to make a formal presentation to, and be interviewed by, the Architect-Engineer Selection Board. After interviews, the firm selected for contract negotiation shall be determined through an order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required. Negotiations shall be conducted beginning with the most preferred firm in the final selection. In addition to addressing the selection criteria above, all responsible sources shall submit an SF-254, Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire, and an SF-255, Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project, which shall be considered by the agency. Solicitation packages are not provided for AE contracts. This is not a request for a proposal. A separate solicitation shall be used to request a proposal from the firm or firms selected. This is not a small business set-aside. The NAICS code applicable to this action is 5413, Architecture, Engineering, and related services.

China, Tel: (86-10) 6839-8033, Fax:(86-10) 6839-8254  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for assisting the Beijing Traffic Management Bureau in developing an overall project implementation plan based on future traffic estimates, with special emphasis given to traffic needs for large events such as the 2008 Olympic Games, state events, expos, conferences, concerts, etc.; clearly identifying different project components required for establishing a state-of-the-art traffic management system and prioritizing these components; and developing an overall implementation schedule.

Beijing is a metropolis with the land of 16800 square kilometers and 11 million people. The eight urban districts have the share of 1370 square kilometers and 6.6 residents. Based on the original chessboard-like road network, the city has been establishing a general urban road network with the integration of highways, which are mainly composed of ring roads and links among ring roads, and arterial roads, minor roads and sideways. It is expected that by 2008 Olympics the road density will reach 2.62 km per square kilometers within the fifth ring road, and motorways in suburb will be 15400 kilometers, of which 718 kilometers are expressways. The density of road network will amount to 91.6 km per square kilometers. The car ownership in Beijing has reached 1,898,000 and drivers 2,947,000 by October 2002. Furthermore, there are currently over 11million non-vehicles and a great deal of transit vehicles running in Beijing. There will be about 18,000 buses and 650 bus lanes by 2008, which carry 4.5 billion passengers each year. The density of bus routes will be 2.16 km per square kilometers. Public transportation is expected to share 60% of commuter?s traffic, and its share of total traffic volume is estimated to rise from the current 26% to over 40%.

In order to efficiently manage the planned road infrastructure and estimated increase in traffic volume by 2008, as well as the traffic generated during the Olympic Games, the City of Beijing is planning to utilize Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) , which will include the establishment of a state-of-the-art computerized traffic monitoring, accident-reporting, and dispatch system.  Some aspects of this overall plan have already been implemented by the BTMB, the potential Grantee.  However, they have expressed a need for foreign assistance in developing the overall project implementation plan.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $286,890 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by local time 4:00 P.M., February 10, 2003 (Monday) at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.

<DESC>Synopsis:

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime Vendor to provide items under the general grouping of metals and metal products and ancillary services for the Southeast Region of the United States. A Prime Vendor, or integrated supplier, can be defined as the designation of a single source of supply for a wide range of products. The requirements covered under this solicitation include, but are not limited to, aluminum, stainless steel, carbon steel, copper, brass, titanium, nickel, alloys, and other industrial metals, in several forms, including wire, plate, sheet, strip, bar, angle, extrusion, pipe, tube, valves, fittings, and any other shape required by the ordering activities. The items required under this solicitation are not fixed to a discrete group of NSNs. Rather, requirements may change and expand or contract due to the needs of our customers. Related services such as cutting to size, scrap and salvage metal removal, and technical support will be included in any resultant contract as needed by ordering activities. 
The Southeast Region consists of the following states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.  
Prospective contractors should have an on-line Electronic Order Entry (EOE) system and must have Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) capability. Subject solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant contract being an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for two base years with three (3) one-year term options. This will be a best value source selection acquisition in which technical merit is considered more important than price. Solicitation SP0560-02-R-0341 is expected to be issued by December 16, 2002 with an estimated closing date of January 30, 2003. To obtain further information or other details, contact Michael Tarkett at (215)737-4081 or Gerry Corcoran at (215)737-4248.

The MH-53 service life is being extended through 2014. IRCM hardware procured under this contract is intended for transition to the CV-22 aircraft as the MH-53s are retired.  USSOCOM anticipates awarding an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity task and delivery order type contract with firm fixed price, cost-plus fixed fee, and time and material contract line items. The estimated maximum amount of the contract is $135M.  The funding is a combination of research and development, and procurement. The period of performance will be approximately four years from the date of award through December 2006. The contract may be structured for a base year and three option years or it may be a four year ordering period.  Anticipated delivery schedule is FY04 and FY05. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334511 and the small business size standard is 750 employees.  The Department of Defense requires all contractors to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to receive solicitations, contract awards, or payments.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

1.4 Discussions
If it is determined to be in the best interests of the Government to conduct discussions (reference subparagraph (d) of FAR 52.212-1 contained in this solicitation), offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs) and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the best value source selection decision.

<DESC>Questions:
1 - From the dimensions which I obtained while at the site visit, I am assuming the present deck height to be satisfactory for the lowest required level and the 18? required jacking to be above this point. Is this correct?

A.  Yes

2 - Segments should be approximately 30 feet long by 20 feet wide providing approximately 600 square feet of usable deck work area. 
Is the required, approximately 600 square feet of usable deck work area for the upper deck area?  

A.  Yes it is the upper deck we are talking about

Is forward extended part of the deck (the extension to access the forward hatch in the side of the fuselage) to be included in the 600 square feet of usable deck work area.? Also are the stair landing platforms to be included in the 600 square feet of usable deck work area.? 

  A.  Yes the extended part of the deck would be part of the 600
  A.  No the stairs will not be part of the 600

3 - Is the required minimum of six 200 pound individuals (1,200 lbs) to be considered as a concentrated area that six individuals could be placed within? Does this 1,200 lbs. include the weight of tools and other related equipment that may be placed upon the deck?

A.  Yes This should be be a area of about 5' by 5'

My concern is with the weight limits which could be placed beyond the outside area of the caster wheels. What is the total of all weight including personal, tools, equipment and possible airplane parts? 

A.  Yes that will inculed all tools and parts " some part can weigh over 250 lbs"

4 - There will be toe-boards a minimum of 4 inches high surrounding the work decks to prevent small items from rolling or being kicked over the edge. No toe-boards at extension fingers.
Would you prefer the 4 inch toe-boards attached to the hand rails so they can be removed when the hand rails are removed? 
For shipping dimension restrictions, the hand rails will be removable. Is this acceptable?

A.   yes they can be part of the hand rails
 
5 - For the walk way between work decks, is one walkway at the upper deck acceptable or will a walkway at both levels of the work decks be required?

A.   walk around should be on the lower level only

In addition to this, the 18 inch height requirement is hereby rescinded.  Also, there can be more than two stands in this project.  You may configure the requirement for more than two stands.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared per the format in Subpart 12, as supplemented with additional information included this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number INL-1G3008 is a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The Government intends to award a firm, fixed price contract for the acquisition of 15 each "commando-type" kayaks with accessories.   

The following Provisions and Clauses are incorporated into this RFQ by reference and are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27.  No addenda apply to these Provisions and Clauses.  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications ? Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items, FAR 52-212-5, Contract Terms and conditions required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.  No additional FAR clauses apply.  The following provides the performance specifications:

Folding boat - kayaks with  easy, fast assembly capable of carrying 1 to 2 persons with all supplies, equipment, rations, etc. - total load capability up to 900 lbs.  Kayaks must be capable of traversing all water types; must be black in color with an olive drab camouflage deck.  Offerors shall include and price a suggested accessory list to include such items as  packing bags, rudder assemblies, repair kits, lumbar support cushions, etc.  Offerors will be evaluated on the following:

a.  Technical specifications of kayaks.  Offerors should note that the Government requires kayaks to operate in a "stealth-type" manner, e.g. minimum noise signature.  Offerors should include in their technical data, detailed information that supports this type of operation.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps is issuing this Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought synopsis as part of a market survey. Sources are sought that can provide the Avenger Short Range Air Defense System with a thermal imaging system allowing the Avenger operators to detect, recognize, and identify airborne targets.  Various aspects of the desired system are outlined in the following paragraphs.

System Description

The Avenger is a HMMWV platform fitted with a weapon-turret consisting of Stinger surface-to-air missiles and a .50 caliber machine gun.  Its primary role is as an air defense weapons platform.  The desired Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) will be externally mounted to the Avenger turret and will be exposed to all elements of an external environment, and could be required to withstand the environmental conditions outlined in MIL-STD-810, Environmental Test Methods & Engineering Guidelines.  The FLIR will be expected to withstand the shock and vibration associated with the HMMWV platform and its weapons.  The FLIR shall utilize 28V DC power supplied by the HMMWV and shall have an RS-170 compatible video line output.  The FLIR should be compatible with the Avenger Fire Control Computer (AFCC), allowing overlay of tracking cues and other targeting information from the AFCC on to the video displayed at the monitor.  Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) submitting information should describe in detail their capabilities for utilizing the existing monitor and controls, as well as concepts of utilization for any new controllers, monitors, or other Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) (spell out).

Threshold Performance Criteria

The current Avenger FLIR is being used as a baseline from which to build the capability of the future Avenger FLIR.   Therefore, the current performance criteria given in this section are being used as the Threshold Performance Criteria.    Manufacturers? systems submitted as a response to this RFI must at minimum meet all of the outlined threshold criteria. Included in these criteria are the following specifications:

1.) Field of View (FOV) ? The current Avenger FLIR utilizes three fields of view.  These are:
WIDE - 21?H?14?V;  RAIN - 12?H?8?V; and NARROW 5.3?H?3.5?V. As a minimum, any submitting OEM must address at least the WIDE and NARROW FOVs, or provide concepts of combinations of FOVs that will allow the operators an optimum capability of target detection, recognition, and identification tasks.  

2.) Detector Parameters - The following parameters should be considered the minimum performance requirements for the desired FLIR.
a. Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference (NETD) ? The Current Avenger FLIR has a Long-Wave IR detector that has a NETD of 360 mK.  As Threshold criteria, the NETD of any submitted FLIR must be no greater than 360 mK.  
b. Pixel Size -- The current pixel size is 45 mm ? the pixel size of systems submitted as a result of this RFI must have a pixel dimension of no greater than 45 mm.  The current system is a SPRITE scanning system, though for this RFI, any submitted systems must utilize serial scanning linear arrays or staring focal plane arrays.
c. Waveband - As a threshold, OEM?s can submit information on imagers sensitive to either the mid-wave (3-5 mm) or long-wave (8-12 mm) infrared wavebands.  

3.) Cooler Parameters ? The following parameters should be considered minimum performance requirements for the detector-cooling unit of the new Avenger FLIR.
a. Cool-Down Time  -- Currently the cool-down time, or the time from powering ON the FLIR until an image is available, is no greater than 5 minutes.  The desired FLIR should have a cool-down time of no greater than 5 minutes. 
b. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) ? At a minimum the cooler of the FLIR must have a Mean Time Between Failures of no less than 3,000 hours.

Objective Performance Criteria

The current state of thermal imaging technology should allow the capabilities of a modern FLIR to exceed the performance characteristics of the existing Avenger FLIR.  It is desirable that the replacement FLIR for the Avenger exceed the older technology in all aspects.  The following is a list of Objective Performance Criteria that should allow the FLIR performance to be greatly enhanced over the existing Avenger FLIR.

1.) FOV ? The objective for the upgraded Avenger FLIR FOV is a two or three FOV system that could extend both the current detection and identification ranges. The wide FOV of the desired FLIR should have similar coverage of the current WIDE FOV for target detection tasks.  The objective Medium and Narrow FOVs are, for the purposes of this RFI, being left open to the concepts of the OEMs.  FOVs that are narrower than the existing Avenger FLIR are achievable and offer improved target recognition and identification ranges.  OEMs are encouraged to submit information on a combination of Medium and Narrow FOVs that will provide an optimum performance of target detection, recognition, and identification.

2.) Detector Parameters - The following parameters should be considered the objective performance requirements for the detector of a desirable FLIR.
a. Detector Type - As an objective performance criterion, the detector will be a staring Focal Plane Array (FPA) and will utilize no moving parts in the optical train.
b. FPA Size - As an objective criterion, the detector FPA will be composed of at least a 256?256-pixel array.  A system with a larger FPA size will be considered more desirable than systems with a smaller array size, all else being equal.
c. NETD ? As an objective criterion, the NETD of any submitted FLIR must be no greater than 70 mK.  Systems with a lower NETD will be considered more desirable than systems with a higher NETD, all else being equal.
d. Pixel Size ? As an objective criterion, pixel size will be no greater than 30 mm. 
e. Waveband - As an objective criterion the desirable FLIR shall be sensitive to mid-wave infrared energy (3-5 mm wavelength).

3.) Cooler Parameters ? The following parameters should be considered objective performance requirements for the detector-cooling unit of the new Avenger FLIR.
Cool-Down Time   - As an objective criterion, the desired FLIR must have a cool-down time of no greater than 4 minutes. 
MTBF ? As an objective criterion, the cooler of the FLIR must have a Mean Time Between Failures of greater than 5,000 hours.

	4.) Integrated Laser Rangefinder (LRF)? As an objective criterion, the desired FLIR shall have an integrated LRF that provides an eyesafe means to accurately determine the exact range to a target.  As a threshold, the LRF shall accurately range to a minimum of 5 km.  As an objective, the LRF shall accurately range a target to 10 km.  It is considered desirable to have extended range with an integrated LRF, all else being equal.  The LRF must be eyesafe.

Responses to this RFI shall as a minimum include; 1) A capability assessment of the company to include production readiness, 2) a description of product and information on how it meets the specification above to include any potential modification to a COTS item needed to achieve the specification 3) Procurement lead time, 3) Rough order of magnitude (ROM) of unit price for potential for purchases from 1 to 1000 units, at quantity intervals placed at the discretion of the OEM. 4) Any potential non-recurring cost, 5) Current failure rate (replacement or repair history), 6) Costing for two years of Contractor Logistics Support and any other maintenance information.  

The RFI should be sent to MSgt J.J. Reznicek,  Avenger Project Officer, Marine Corps Systems Comman, Daly Hall, 2079 Wharton Ave., Quantico, VA 22134 or e-mailed to Reznicekjj@mcsc.usmc.mil with a copy sent to Valerie Mosqueira at same address or e-mailed to mosqueiravj@mcsc.usmc.mil.
