<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Spokane Ressearch Laboratory, Spokane, WA has a requirement to study the feasibility of applying intelligent video systems (IVS) to the monitoring of fixed machinery, such as conveyors, to detect the presence of workers near hazardous areas and provide an alarm and/or control signal output. 

This requirement is solicited as a small business set-aside.

The CDC intens to award a single Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13. 

Preliminary tests of this technology at NIOSH have shown that IVS has potential for this application; however, all tests were conducted during daylight conditions and in favorable weather, and only for short durations.  A better understanding is needed regarding the reliability of these systems in changing light conditions, harsh weather, and during 24-hour continuous operation.  IVS is currently in use for surveillance and security, but safety applications will require even higher reliability.

The main deliverable for this contract will be a feasibility test report for the application of IVS to machine safety monitoring in an outdoor environment.  The feasibility test will be conducted at the contractor?s facility on a mock-up of a small rock conveyor system.  The mockup can be constructed from wood or other material (approximately 4 ft wide by 25 ft long), but must have actual conveyor belt material running along its length for color and contrast realism.


The final feasibility test report shall cover the following topics at a minimum:
	IVS description
	Camera selection and layout
	Feasibility test description
	Test results:  
-	whole body intrusion into large hazardous areas
-	detection of hand or arm in small hazardous areas
-	effects of lighting conditions
-	effects of differing clothing and contrast
-	effects of rain
-	false alarm rate and causes
?	Feasibility discussion ? issues, considerations, recommendations
?	Recommendations for cameras, external lighting, and camera positioning
?	Maintenance and calibration requirements 
?	Cost of IVS implementation
?	Video files (mpg, avi formats) and photos showing examples of the different test scenarios that show the operator interface with the camera view and alarm display.

The complete request for quotation document will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about April 2, 2008 and quotes will be due on or about April 10, 2008.  No verbal or written request for copies will be accepted.  It is the responsibility of perspective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this presolicitation at the FedBizOpps internet site.  

No government-wide notes apply.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract.   The website is www.ccr.gov.

All responsible responsive sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

GOVPAY ELECTRONIC INVOICING REQUIREMENTS All payment requests must be submitted electronically through GovPay.  "Payment request" means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment by a contractor. To constitute a proper invoice, the GovPay payment request must conform to the requirements identified in FAR 32.905(b), "Payment Documentation and Process" and FAR 52.232-25, "Prompt Payment (OCT 2003)". To ensure the timely processing of invoices GovPay uses an automated "workflow" process to route invoices for review, approvals and payment; as required by the "Prompt Payment Act". Detailed GovPay information for use of GovPay may be obtained on the Internet at www.govpay.gov.  This web site includes user manuals, training resources, instructions for registration and contact information for the GovPay help desk for additional support.  All users can access reports on the status of their invoices. Supporting documentation shall be attached to the GovPay invoice in the form of "flat files" in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and an Adobe PDF file.  There is a 4MB limitation on file size for these attachments, per header or line item.  Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are NOT acceptable electronic forms for payment requests.   GovPay uses the contractor information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as one of the components for validating contractor registration.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to submit accurate and current CCR information.  Failure to register and maintain CCR information, or if it has expired, been suspended, been deleted, or could not be found, will result in rejection of your invoice.  An invoice submitted during the period for which information in the CCR could not be verified must be resubmitted for payment after successfully registering or updating registration in CCR.  Contractors are encouraged to review their CCR information to ensure the most current information is available for GovPay. The CCR Assistance Center is available to provide assistance and answer questions.  They can be reached at 1-888-227-2423 or on the web at http://www.ccr.gov. [End of clause]

<DESC>The scale and rate of urban growth of cities in India ,which has occurred largely in an unplanned way, has led to serious infrastructure deficiencies that reduce business productivity, deflect new investors, and compromise the quality of life for all income strata, particularly burdening the urban poor.

An annual resource gap of approximately Rs 17000 crores (US $ 3.5) Billion has been estimated for the period 1996-2006 in the water and sanitation sector alone. However, the problem of improving urban infrastructure delivery is not only an issue of money. Oftentimes local governments and other infrastructure project sponsors lack the capacity to develop good bankable projects that can absorb capital resources from the market and be operated in a financially sustainable manner.

USAID/Indias response to the need for improved urban infrastructure service delivery is its Financial Institutions Reform and Expansion Project (FIRE-D) .Begun in 1994, FIRE
Project (Phases I and II  ,1994-2003) has established a position on the cutting edge of reforms in Indias water and sanitation sector. Project achievements; have served as key building blocks for the sectors reform agenda. These include : the acceptance of the concept of commercial viability as a factor in water sanitation project structuring; the introduction in India of market based mechanisms for municipal credit rating and accessing domestic capital markets to finance urban infrastructure; raising the profile of urban sector issues in India and their systematic redressal; development of  Model Municipal legislation to fully implement the 74th Constitution Amendment on decentralization and devolution of powers to ULBs; ground breaking of  Indias first BOOT project on water sanitation in Tirupur; first pooled financing issue with DCA credit enhancement for financing water sanitation projects; initiation of municipal accounting reforms and promotion of state level city managers associations .

However, there is an urgent need for institutionalization of the reform process with support for consolidation, scaling up and replication of water sanitation project development and implementation with market based financing mechanisms being adopted in more states and cities.

Based on the lessons learnt from the FIRE D Phase I & II and  feed back received from GOI and counterpart institutions ,USAID/India intends to continue to support implementation of GOI urban sector reform agenda through FIRE D-III (2003-2008) program ,which is designed to address :

- Sustainable state level institutional models for project
  development & financing
- Enhanced market based financing initiatives
- Increased project successes 

The ultimate objective of providing improved access of water and sanitation services in cities, particularly for the urban poor.

USAID anticipates awarding a cost plus fixed fee completion contract (CPFF) for 5 years under FIRE(D)-III program. Detailed information about this solicitation is contained in the RFP that will be available with the Regional Contracting Officer, USAID/New Delhi and shall be published in the Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.eps.gov/.

<DESC>This contract is for the purpose of restoring irrigation water to the Hanksville Irrigation Company.     A flood event in October 2006 washed out the existing irrigation dam in the Fremont River leaving the water users without means of diverting water to approximately 800 acres of irrigated fields.      

The items of work required include the construction of a new  concrete diversion dam in the corridor of the Fremont River approximately 2 miles upstream of the community of Hanksville.     Additional components of the diversion structure and delivery system include a rock raceway for fish passage at the diversion structure, a concrete sediment sluicing structure, HDPE irrigation pipeline, and a new concrete water control structure at the downstream end of the pipeline for delivering water to the existing irrigation ditches.     The water control structure will also incorporate a suspended pipe bridge over the river providing water to a portion of the irrigated farmland opposite the water control structure.

As the diversion structure is in the river itself and portions of the irrigation pipeline are at the edge of the active river corridor, rock armament will be required in order to protect and sustain the life span of the proposed engineering practices.


THIS IS NOT SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.
THIS WILL BE COMPETED FULL-OPEN COMPETITION.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Notice to Offerers:  This procurement is part of the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System RED/Yellow/Green Program.  Award will be based on the contracting officer's decision as to which offer provides the best value to the Navy, price, past performance, and other factors considered. NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).   (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.   ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).   (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, f!  irst article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.   (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows: 	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. 	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs. 	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery. (e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, a written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NSLC at the above address.  The request must include the requester's name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity  (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NSLC will provide each supplier, at no charge, an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing their individual data.

NOTE: (1)	The I-9 must be provided before a badge will be issued for unclassified contract work, for access to the shipyard. (2)	If the contract requires access to classified material, a visit request identifying the employee?s clearance status may suffice depending on the employee?s status within the JPAS database. (3)	In the case of contractor truck drivers, knowing some are owner operators, if they are carrying proof of citizenship they can be issued a badge for access to drop off/pick up material. (4)	If the truck driver does not have sufficient documentation and the sponsor is willing to escort the driver to/from the desired location, a by-escort badge may be issued. VENDORS/CONTRACTORS SHALL FORWARD ALL VISIT REQUESTS ON THEIR COMPANY LETTERHEAD SIGNED BY AN AUTHORIZED COMPANY OFFICER. Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States.

<CONTACT>Bruce Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2234, Fax 301-443-0501, Email ba9i@nih.gov - Bruce Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2234, Fax 301-443-0501, Email ba9i@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP No. NIMH-08-DN-00019) entitled High-throughput Collection of Gene Expression Data in Developing Rhesus Macaque Brain, on or about April 4, 2008, under full and open competitive procedures.  It is anticipated that one contract will be awarded from this solicitation, on or about September 2008, for a period of 2 years with options to extend.  NIMH is the lead institute for this Blueprint project (http://www.neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/).

NIMH's overall goal for this contract is to develop a publicly available data resource to stimulate research in gene expression during normal brain development.  The recent sequencing of the genome of the Rhesus macaque, Macaca mulatta, as well as its broad application as a research model, suggest that this nonhuman primate species would provide the optimal translational bridge between existing gene expression atlases in other
species, including mouse, and future efforts in human. 

This contract will require high throughput collection of gene expression data, and development of a digital brain atlas and associated informatics tools for the analysis of gene expression in specific regions of developing Rhesus macaque brain. More specifically this contract will utilize high throughput, automated histological processing of samples from the developing Rhesus macaque brain, including sectioning, histological staining, and in situ hybridization, resulting in the generation of high resolution gene expression data related to cytoarchitecture which will be represented in a publicly-available digital brain atlas with associated informatics tools, to facilitate data searches and analyses by other investigators.

To successfully accomplish the goals of this contract, capable organizations must demonstrate expertise in: 1) neurobiology; 2) both automated and high throughput histological processing, including in situ hybridization; and 3) development of digital atlases of gene expression, associated informatics tools, and web-based dissemination of data.

Tissues for analysis under this contract will be obtained via a separate contract with NIMH (to be established), with a facility that has access to well-defined colonies of rhesus macaques, raised in naturalistic settings, where the lineage and hierarchical status of each animal is characterized in detail. This other facility will prepare and transfer the tissues to this contract facility for histological processing and digitization as described above. This contractor will be required to work effectively and closely with the animal facility contractor.

RFP No. NIMH-08-DN-00019 will be available on or about April 4, 2008 with the receipt date of proposals on or about June 4, 2008.  The RFP will be available solely via the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  It will be the offeror?s responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for release of the solicitation, and any possible subsequent amendments, and to download the documents and all attachments.  The RFP for this requirement will include the Statement of Work, Deliverables, and Reporting Requirements, the Technical Evaluation Criteria, and proposal preparation instructions. All information required for the submission of an offeror will be contained in the electronic RFP package. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal that will be considered by the NIMH. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. Please contact Bruce Anderson, NIMH Contracting Officer at 301-443-2234, or ba9i@nih.gov, for further information.

Data submitted by pesticide manufacturers (registrants), other EPA programs, other Federal agencies, the states, Indian tribes, cities, municipalities and private citizens, and data published in public, open literature are used to determine whether pesticides and their proposed uses may pose an unreasonable adverse effect on human health and the environment. OPP evaluates the data and determines whether the data are adequate for regulatory decision-making or whether additional data are required from the registrants, performs hazard and risk assessments on the data to decide whether the pesticide or its proposed uses should be registered in compliance the FIFRA, and determines whether new procedures or methodologies for estimating possible pesticide hazards to human must be developed. Under the proposed contract, the Contractor shall: 1) Review and Evaluation of Health-related Pesticide Toxicity Data; 2) Test Guideline Support; 3) Pathology Evaluations; 5) Special Projects: Evaluations of Complex Toxicological Data and Issues; and 6) Conduct Backup Literature Search and Hard Copy Acquisition.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541711   NAICS Code: 541711  The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a purchase order, using FAR Part 13 procedures, for source emissions inventory development for the Fairbanks, Alaska airshed.  The goal of the resulting purchase order is to develop and document a high-resolution source emissions inventory for the airshed composed of Fairbanks, AK, and surrounding areas, suitable for use in emissions processing for the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model.  We anticipate performing CMAQ model simulations over the Fairbanks area with  horizontal grid cell sizes of 4- and 1-km.  Model simulations will be conducted for field study periods from winter 2007/2008.  The emissions processing system known as the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) system will be used to convert the emissions inventory information into  temporally-, spatially-, and species-allocated emissions fluxes for use by the CMAQ model.  Emissions information is required for CO, NOx, SOx, NH3,VOC, PM2.5, and coarse PM for all significant source sectors emitting in the Fairbanks area.  Emissions inventory data will be compared with receptor  modeling analyses to confirm the representation and relative significance of various source sectors.  Tasks shall include (but not be limited to) the following: preparing a detailed workplan and QA/QC plan for the assembly of a source emissions inventory for the Fairbanks, AK airshed; and  obtaining, analyzing, and assembling emissions factor and activity data by source sector for on-road mobile sources, for non-road mobile sources, for point sources, and for area sources.  Period of performance will be 7 months from award of the purchase order.   A Request for Quotations (RFQ) with  complete information will be posted on the EPA's website in approximately 15 days at the following address:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/   Responses to the RFQ will be due approximately 30 days after issuance of the RFQ.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Anna Mustard, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-4556
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541711   NAICS Code: 541711   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a purchase order, using FAR Part 13 procedures, for a contractor to develop, adapt, and test a methodology for stable boundary layer representation (initial onset, space/time evolution, dissipation) in three-dimensional numerical mesoscale meteorological models, such as the MM5 or the WRF/arw model.  The specific focus of the work will be on stable boundary layer representation in dark and extremely cold environments such as exist over the Fairbanks, AK area in wintertime  conditions, where ambient temperatures can reach -40 degrees to -50 degrees F, often accompanied by ice fogs.  In this environment fine particulate matter can be trapped in a shallow layer near the ground, concentrated to high mass loadings and deteriorating air quality to worrisome levels.  It is  therefore quite important to characterize the meteorological environment as accurately as possible to study the pollution accumulating in these shallow cold layers. As part of an analysis of the 2007/2008 field study data, meteorological modeling and characterization will be needed for selected  time periods from the winter study.  A modeling domain will be established covering central Alaska using nested grid sizes down to a grid size of about 1 km focusing on the region over Fairbanks.  The complex mountain/valley terrain of central Alaska, including the North Star Borough (Fairbanks)  must be well-represented in the model to accurately simulate drainage and slope flows.  Land-surface models must be tested for snow-covered conditions, and the model must also be tested for simulation of ice fogs under extremely cold temperatures.  An assessment of the optimal vertical structure of  the modeling domain must be made to best capture the structure of the shallow stable layer near the ground.  All physics options available in the mesoscale model should be selected for their applicability to wintertime conditions in Alaska.  The particular features of polar versions of MM5 and/or  WRF/arw models should be considered for applicability to this problem. Period of performance will be 13 months from award of the purchase order.   A Request for Quotation (RFQ) with complete information will be posted on the EPA's website in approximately 15 days at the following address:   http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/   Responses to the RFQ will be due approximately 30 days after issuance of the RFQ.  Hard copies of the RFQ will not be available.  Offerors must submit both a technical proposal and a price proposal.  The price proposal must show a breakout of costs. The technical  proposal must include responses to the Technical Evaluation Criteria, which will be posted with the RFQ.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Date:  20 March Year:  2008 Contracting Office Address: ATTN: DAVID J. DECANDIA [(973) 724-4674] JOINT ACQUISITIONS CONTRACTING CENTER US ARMY JOINT MUNITIONS & LETHALITY LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT COMMAND AMSML-AQ-JA, BLDG 10 PICATINNY ARSENAL, NJ 07806-5000 Subject: Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Request for Proposals Suuporting R&D Efforts for Lethality and Advanced Fire Control Technology Concentrations Proposed Solicitation Number:  W15QKN-08-R-0449 Opening Date:  24 Mar 08 Closing Date:  14 Apr 08 Description: The purpose of the subject BAA is to solicit & Request Project  Proposals (RPP) in support of the Research Areas of Lethality and Advanced Fire Control, which are the two major technology concentrations outlined herein.  Appropriated funding has been made available to support only these two major technology concentrations. The Government shall reserve the right to award a procurement contract grant, cooperative agreement or ýýýother transactionýýý (OT) as a result of this BAA.  It is the Governments intent to maximize offeror participation, and to evaluate varying prototype proposals (procurement or OT) from various offerors (traditional and non-traditional). The acquisition approach within this BAA allows the Government the opportunity  to assess the offerorýýýs understanding of the two SOO's within the solicitation by evaluating their approach to theeffort. The offeror using this SOO  and their unique knowledge, skills, and  abilities shall provide a detailed proposal, to include the SOW. The proposal shall address the deliverables that are required to meet  the program objectives.  The proposal shall provide for the options to  continue efforts indicating the critical technology demonstrations,  analysis and sub-system level trades, culminating in a demonstration of  TRL 4.  Technical rationale and realism will guide the level of risk to  be overcome as related to the technology risk vs technology reward  tradeoff per the period of performance.  Technology Readiness Levels  (TRL) will be applied with a goal of TRL 4.  Demonstrations which  substantiate TRL 5 (and higher) are certainly encouraged. Statement of Objectives (SOO) for the design of the Advanced Fire  Control Technology for Small Arms: The current problem is that  threat targets are moving and then seek cover behind objects  (in defilade).  Sixty percent (60%) of aiming involves a  soldier standing in an unsupported firing position.   In addition, precision engagement is limited due to inaccurate  tactical range determination.  Weapon system weight and  multiple batteries required to provide power to advanced  sighting systems lead to reduced weapon availability.  To  address possible solutions, the problem domain can be  sub-divided into the functional areas, but the overall solution  must be an integrated approach to be a viable solution.   Statement of Objectives (SOO) for the design of the Advanced  Lethality Armament Technology for Small Arms. The main purpose of this technology is to demonstrate advanced lethality  armament component technology for providing improved maneuver  capability and munition effectiveness on targets.  The targets  in question are those in defilade which the warfighter cannot  incapacitate as they are hidden behind objects and/or under  cover.  The incapacitation is limited by small payload and  spray alignment effectiveness at defilade targets.   Weight reduction, sound/audio signature reduction and recoil  reduction/ mitigation also ties into the problem at hand and  must be considered.  Solutions to the previously described  problem will arise from filling in technology gaps which can  then be integrated in order to provide an effective system to  the warfighter. The point of contact for this solicitation is David DeCandia  (email david.decandia@us.army.mil, telephone 973-724-4674),  Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command,  AMSML-AQ-JA, Bldg 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.   This pre-solicitation notice does not constitute a formal BAA.   All offerors are encouraged to refer to http://procnet.pica.army.mil/  on or about 24 March 2008 to download the formal BAA.   Please note that information contained within this pre-solicitation  notice may be superceded by information contained within the BAA.

<DESC>Provide all drilling and barge services to accomplish the exploration in the area identified for construction of the breakwater. The breakwater will be located in the area between the mouth of the existing harbor and the Bristol Fuel Dock in the area  known locally as Scandinavian Beach. The purpose of this exploration is to sample and log the soils from mudline to a depth of 50 feet for two of the borings and to a depth of 30 feet for the other two borings and to obtain samples for laboratory testing.  A total of four borings will be drilled and sampled. According to existing information, we currently believe that the soils will consist of soft silt or clay and that sampling with Shelby tubes will be possible. The water depth in the drill area ranges fr om about zero to about 100 feet at low tide and the tide fluctuates about 15 to 20 feet. It may be necessary to let the barge go dry during the drilling operation.

ACPS ? PBL, Request for Information (RFI)

Request for Information:  This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations as how best to define requirements for a full service Performance Based Logistics (PBL) solicitation/contract in support of Air Conditioning Plant Systems located on CVN 68 - 75 and CVN 76, 77 & 78 Class Aircraft Carriers.

Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

Background:  DSCC is the lead DLA center for maritime weapon systems.  DSCC is responsible for providing the Navy with the highest level of support, worldwide.  It is DLA?s goal to provide the best value to our military customer while reducing costs and improving efficiencies.  To meet our goals and future customer challenges, DSCC is continuing to benchmark with the private sector to determine which industry practices can be adopted to support the requirements of the Navy.  DSCC, in working with the Navy, has determined that a performance based contract would effectively support the warfighter.  Further review of the Navy PBL guide can be located at www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/acps/index.html.

The Government contemplates possibly issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15, that may result in a fixed price contract lasting10 ? years (2 year base with 8, one ? year options).  Estimated award date is 4th quarter FY 09.  Based on the results of a business case ?best value? analysis, DSCC ? Maritime, may elect to solicit/award by Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) to single or multiple vendors.  Prospective vendors may respond to individual or all CLIN?s.

Responses:  Written response to this RFI shall be limited to 25 pages, single space.  If material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  Response should include, but is not limited to the following:  
(A)	Company History:  A one page history to include; Small Business Administration (SBA) size classification; major products; and primary customer base.

Moderate applications must be given Special Handling to minimize opportunity for of harm resulting from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or information modification.  The intent is to reengineer business processes and implement these changes into the  system for better flow of application use. DESCRIPTION: The Contractor shall provide business process reengineering and system development life cycle support for the Office of Administration Services Information System (OASIS).    OASIS is a secure portal that provides EPA employees access to  eighteen OARM/OA custom applications.  The work required under this Task includes: analysis of the existing OASIS custom application and to document the As-Is state; status and workflows.  Then make determination for the To-Be state; with GAP Analysis to identify alternatives for achieving the  To-Be state; with design of the new applications. The Contractor shall develop new workflow processes for each OASIS application.  The new workflow processes must provide process improvements and eliminate redundant steps. The period of performance shall be for six months from date of award. This  requirement also has a 6-month option period. OASIS TECHNICAL OVERVIEW: OASIS is a custom in house written application, developed in ColdFusion MX8 as the front end and Oracle 10g database. The application is accessed by over 500 users on a daily basis. All code in this effort will be written by  the EPA in house IT staff.  OASIS currently has three environments, production, development and test. The servers in each environment are Dell Power Edge servers.   Below is a list of subtasks and the work that is required for each. Subtask 1 - Analyze and Evaluate As-Is Business Processes for  OASIS Applications The Contractor shall conduct an independent review and or audit of the business processes and applications that comprise OASIS.  The goal of this review is to assess current business processes, workflow, and to document the As-Is state.  The Contractor will interview OASIS users  to assess and document current business processes and workflows.  The goal of this review is to assemble all information necessary to document the As-Is state. Deliverable: 	Current State Assessment Report Subtask 2 - Document To-Be Environment and Alternatives The Contractor shall conduct  interviews with existing users of the OASIS applications and OARM/OA management to identify expected (desired) business and operational goals.  For new OASIS applications, the users will be interviewed and all requirements are gathered to ensure a detailed workflow process is mapped before software  design shall start.  The Contractor shall describe how the business processes can be improved and simplified, and how the users' roles can be managed to deliver the functionality required in a more streamlined manner.  The Contractor shall identify how to better address the users' needs and how to  simplify their processing activities.  The Contractor shall recommend a data infrastructure that supports integrated, online information and services center, which serves as a single point of access to all of the OARM/OA activities within a Portal environment. The structure of this environment  shall be expandable, and `capable of supporting the addition of future applications.  The environment shall be consistent with the OARM/OA web, security and privacy policies.  The Contractor shall provide a To-Be process model describing the above environment, and the reengineering and redesign  requirements necessary to achieve it. For each application, the Contractor will develop a requirements specification that addresses functional, operational and system performance considerations.  For the OASIS portal and each application, the Contractor will identify the operational rules that  define system security requirements including access and roles, and how the business processes can be improved and simplified.   In combination, the To-Be requirements for each application and the OASIS portal will comprise the To-Be state. Deliverable: 	Future State Summary  Report Deliverable: 	Future State design with new requirements for workflows  Subtask 3 - System Reengineering and Design Implementation  Following approval from OARM/OA management, the Contractor shall perform system engineering and design activities to implement the To-Be environment.  This  will include definitions, integrated system design, database design and other design activities.  This effort will also address system conversion activities.  All system design must be done using EPA approved software products and all implementations must comply with established agency standards.   The portal and supporting applications will be designed to achieve a common, standard "look and feel," with a central system of role based security that supports the users and the OARM/OA IT Team.  The portal will be engineered to permit the IT Team to add new applications, and include features  such as help desk tools, email communications and user-oriented Help systems. Administrative functionality should be designed to simplify system maintenance processes and to leverage and optimize existing resources. This includes providing users with tools to manage and process their data more  efficiently.

<DESC>Work will replace existing steam and condensate lines between building 11 and 1.  The line will need to be assessed for asbestos insulation and abatement as needed will need to be part of the project.  The project will also replace old 150 ton reciprocal chiller in main chiller room and upgrade 50 ton unit for surgery, walk in refrigerator in Lab, and building 45 rooftop units to provide environmentally preferred refrigerant.  Building 45 should also be evaluated and upgrade for capacity and energy efficiency.  The 150 ton chiller will be a centrifugal or screw type chiller based on life cycle cost analysis.  Energy efficiency will be an important consideration in the replacement unit. All work must be designed within a construction price range of $250 to $500.  The AE will provide an initial estimate of cost to perform the above work and will design only those items that can be provided within the cost limitation. Submission requirements are the initial estimate and preliminary design submission, a 50% design submission, and a 95% design submission.  The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the AE to minimize impact of the construction.  The AE will provide four sets of documents at each submission including a cost estimate and will provide a set of AutoCAD drawings and specs in Microsoft Word at the final submission.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR>---------------<BR>A.	 General Information<BR><BR>	Europe Region seeks approval to initiate the standardization process for IV Catheters, Safety & Conventional for its 55 Army, Navy, and US Air Force me dical facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia.  Standardization for this product line, IV Catheters, Safety & Conventional, represents new or first-time initiative for the Europe Region.  This product line includes the following products in the following sizes.<BR>a.	Conventional IV Catheters sizes: 10ga 3 inches, 12ga 3 inches; 14ga 1-3/4  inches, 2-1/4  inches, 3-1/4 inches, 5-1/4 inches; 16ga 1-1/8 inches, 1-1/4 inches, 1-3/4  inches; 18ga 1-1/8 inches, 1 -1/4 inches, 18 1 inch, 1-3/4  inches, 2  inches; 20ga 1-1/8  inches, 1-1/4  inches, 1-3/4  inches, 2  inches; 22g 1 inch; 24g 3/4 inch.<BR>b.	Conventional IV Catheter Winged sizes: 18ga 1-1/4 inches; 20ga 1-1/4  inches; 24ga 5/8 inch; 19ga with 12 inch tu bing; 23ga with 12 inch tubing; 25ga with 3 inch tubing.	<BR>c.	Safety IV Catheters sizes: 14ga 1-1/4 inches, 1-3/4 inches, 2 inches; 16ga 1-1/8 inches, 1-1/4 inches, 2 inches; 18ga 1-1/8 inches, 1-1/4 inches; 20ga 1 inch, 1-1/8 inches, 1-1/4  inches; 22ga  1 inch; 24ga 1/2 inch, 3/4 inch.<BR>d.	Safety IV Catheter Winged sizes: 14ga 2 inches; 16ga 1-1/4  inches; 18ga 1-1/8 inches, 1-1/4 inches; 20ga 1 inch, 1-1/8  inches, 1-1/4 inch, 22ga 1 inch, 24ga 1/2 inch, ? inch.<BR>Vendors are required to supply all i tems listed in all sizes listed. <BR><BR>	The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, via USAMMCE.<BR><BR>	The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Medical Activity He idelberg, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 31st Medical Group Aviano, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Az ores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. Army CENTCOM.<BR><BR>	This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pu rsuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This Request for Quotes (RFQ) is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program, and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.  <BR><BR>	The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with t hree (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined,  are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selecti on of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR>  <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>	The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of IV Catheters Safety and Conventional, which at a minimum includes the product lines below.   Within this region, this product line has an est imated annual dollar requirement of $2,889,405.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top ten high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR>Catheter IV 18ga 1 1/4inL Polyurethane Radiopaque V  POINT Latex-Free Safety Shield	$387,055.00<BR>Catheter IV 14ga 3 1/4inL Fluoroethylkene Polymer Radiopaque Latex-Free	$369,638.00<BR>Catheter IV 18ga 1 1/4inL Teflon Radiopaque Winged Latex-Free Safety Shield	$266,115.00<BR>Catheter IV 18ga 1 1/8inL Vialo n Radiopaque Latex-Free	$250,222.00<BR>Catheter IV 14ga 1 3/4inL Vialon Radiopaque Latex-Free	$118,246.00<BR>Catheter IV 20ga 1 1/4inL Teflon Radiopaque Winged Latex-Free Safety Shield	$117,999.00<BR>Catheter IV 18ga 2inL Polypropelene Radiopaque w/syringe  Latex-Free	$95,948.00<BR>Catheter IV 16ga 1 1/4inL Teflon Radiopaque Latex-Free Safety Shield	$94,316.00<BR>Catheter IV 20ga 1 1/8inL Vialon Radiopaque Latex-Free	$88,767.00<BR>Catheter IV 18ga 1 1/8inL Vialon Radiopaque Winged Latex-Free Safety Shield	$7 8,532.00<BR> <BR>	At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MS DS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>	DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil  all e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  Please ensure that all communications of sign ificant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) will be digitally signed. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal d eadline will be disqualified from participating.<BR><BR>	This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due  to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested informati on has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first sub mission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>	The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Regi on. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>	The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or pro duct lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this an nouncement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the righ t to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient comp etition among vendors.<BR><BR>	Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor responses, th e TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The respon ses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participat e in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>1. In general acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: <BR>a. The business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete lin e of the subject medical/surgical consumables.<BR>b. Based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community applicable to such produ cts or services.<BR>c. The vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>d. The vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor (PV) for the r egion (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified).<BR>e. The vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to provide a discount from  DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore National FSS prices do not represent a discount off DAPA.<BR>f. The vendors informa tion provided is factually correct.<BR>2. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:  <BR> <BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of IV Catheters, Safety and Conventional products for single use.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.

Vendors must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delays that occur with Europes Custom Offices.  Provide acknowledgement of this requirement in response to this RFQ.<BR><BR>	Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request literature and samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using both a literature review and hands on evaluation in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  As mentioned in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) t o the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (DSN 371-2108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice to ship  literature and samples for the clinical evaluation at Phase II.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the shipment of literature and samples by 5:00PM EST on the 14th Calendar day after the issue date of the notice to supply samples will be disqualifi ed from the standardization process.  NOTE: All vendors must send TRBO POC verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor, and anticipated delivery date.<BR><BR>	Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scal e, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance crite ria are equally weighted. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores an d how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standard ization initiative.   <BR> <BR>	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-cl inical (non-patient) setting.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR> <BR>Vendor products meet the Clinically Acceptable Target Threshold of 3.00<BR><BR>1.	Packaging ident ifies the gauge and length of the catheter (safety in urgent 				care setting)<BR>a.	Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to select the appropriate size for patient care needs<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF using each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<BR>2.	The catheter allows visualization of flashback (clinical efficiency)<BR>	a.   Allows additional confirmation clinician has entered the vein<BR>	b.   This criterion will be eva luated 4 times by each participating MTF using 			each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<BR>3.	The catheter hub is Luer-Lock compatible to secure tubing (patient safety)<BR>	a.   Prevents tubing from accidental disconnects<BR> 	b.   This criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF using 			each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<BR>4.	The catheter sheath moves freely on the needle to facilitate cannulation 				(patient comfort)<BR>	 a.   Causes less manipulation at insertion site<BR>	b.   This criterion will be evaluated 4 times by each participating MTF using 			each product sample by clinical personnel in a non-clinical setting.<BR>5.	The safety feature (if applicable) is an integra l part of the device, activates 			automatically and is not an accessory. (clinician safety)<BR>	a.   Prevention of accidental needle stick<BR>	b.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR>---------------<BR>A.	 General Information<BR>The Europe Region (TRBO Europe), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 55 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Advanced Wound Care products.  This product line consists primarily of products with sizes  documented in Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process of this announcement.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically prefe rred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Cente r, U. S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army He alth Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. Army CENTCOM.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additi onal information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three  (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is May 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of  a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF prefere nce and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the  category of Advanced Wound Care, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.   Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $650,533.50.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project include: (1) Transparent Dressings: sizes- 4x4? , 5?x4, 3?x3 3/8, 2 3/8x2?, 4x5 7/8, 2x1?, 11x16, 11x4, 6x8, 5?x10, 4x8 totaling $537,804.52 purchased, (2) Hydrocolloid Dressings: si zes- 6x8, 4x4.7,4x4, 2x2 3/8, 6x6, 1?x1? totaling $48,883.73 purchased, (3) Hydrogel Dressings/Fillers: sizes- 6x6, 4x4, 8x8, tubes- ?oz, 1oz totaling $14,218.0 3 purchased, (4) Foam Dressings: sizes- 3?x3?, 4x4?, 5 5/8 x5 5/8, 7?x8?, 5 5/8x6 1/8, 5?x5? totaling $8,128.72 purchased, (5) Alginate Dressings: sizes- 2x2, 4x4, 4x8, 12in rope totaling $3,634.25 purchased.  (All sizes noted above are expressed in inches  unless otherwise identified.)  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company criteria below.  <BR><BR>At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementati on, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Inst ructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil.  Submi ssions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participation.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic r esponses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm w ith the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm recei pt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors,  without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company questions list ed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region rese rves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an e fficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process:  Interested vendors will respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor re sponses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability.    After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria:  Generally, responses to all questions in  this section demonstrate: (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that th e line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor (PV) for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts o ff DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqua lify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	At a minimum your company must manufacture or distribute:  (All sizes below are expre ssed in inches unless otherwise identified.)  <BR>a.	Transparent Dressings:  Sizes 4x4 3/4, 5 1/2x4, 3 3/4x3 3/8, 2 3/8x2 3/4, 4x 5 7/8, 2x1 1/2, 11x16 11x4, 6x8, 5 1/2x10, 4x8.  <BR>b.

Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Advanced Wound Care product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or  show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) Your DAPA number is: __________________.  <BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the PV (currently, Europes PV is Owens & Minor) for distribution in the Europe Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.) <BR>4.	Vendors must offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note that vendors that fail to offer a discount from DA PA will be disqualified.) <BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Your company must be able to send samples to this region by U nited States Postal Service (USPS).  This form of mailing has proven to be the best at eliminating delays due to International Customs.   <BR>7.	Vendor must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delay s that occur with Europes Custom Offices.  Provide acknowledgement of this requirement with the initial submittal.<BR>8.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the Advanced W ound Care products including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.

Vendors must provide visu al examples demonstrating product labels with visible expiration dates of at least 12 pt fonts on all exterior, intermediate and individual packaging and provide evidence of such (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Pro cess:  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request literature and/or samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using both a literatur e review and hands on evaluation in a non-clinical setting.  As indicated in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the  following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (DSN 371-2108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Literature will be e-mailed or shipped via the same procedure as samples.  Vendo rs will be given 10 calendar days to ship samples.  Literature and samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 4:00PM EST on the 10th calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consider ation in the standardization process. Vendors must forward verification (e-mail) of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>Designated MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not accep table, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The CPT has established a target t hreshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Ta rget Threshold of 3.00.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.   <BR> <BR>To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical profes sionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in an inpat ient setting, if needed.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.00  <BR><BR>Hydrocolloid Dressings:<BR>1.	Dressing may be c ut to required size.<BR>2.	Skin remains intact when dressing is removed.<BR>3.	Dressing adheres to skin without rolling edges.<BR>4.	Dressing molds around uneven surfaces.<BR>5.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing has a long wear time  before required change.<BR>Transparent Film Dressings:<BR>1.	Skin remains intact when dressing is removed.<BR>2.	Dressing is available in different sizes.<BR>3.	Dressing allows removal in one piece.<BR>4.	Dressing can be cut-to-fit and shaped to cover dif ficult anatomical areas.<BR>5.	Literature supports the use of dressing with other topical medications.<BR>6.	Dressing does not have an adhesive that irritates s kin.<BR>7.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing has a high vapor transfer ability to reduce maceration of surrounding skin.<BR>Hydrogel Dressings:<BR>1.	Dressing allows visualization of wound.<BR>2.	Dressing can be removed in one piece .<BR>3.	Dressing can be cut-to-fit.<BR>4.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing allows for moisture vapor permeability.<BR>5.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing can be used with topical medications.<BR>Alginate Dr essings:<BR>1.	Dressing maintains its integrity when wet.<BR>2.	Dressing is removed from wound without irritating skin.<BR>3.	Dressing is soft and conformable.<BR>4.	Dressing is highly absorbent when it comes in contact with wound exudates.<BR>Foam Dressin gs:<BR>1.	Dressing can be cut without compromising its function.<BR>2.	Dressing can be shaped to cover difficult anatomical areas.<BR>3.	Dressing adheres to wound bed.<BR>4.	Dressing remains intact when saturated.<BR><BR>Market Search Request for Informati on:  Our clinicians are attempting to stay abreast of technological advances in this product line.  None of the information provided based on the following feedback will be used to determine technical or clinical acceptability. Please describe any features  that your products possess that use new design or technology.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process:  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data  based on a committed volume of 80% of the total  Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided ten (10) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 1 0th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluat e quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company  factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volu me for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  1) Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region (Post-Standardization Costs), 2) Potential Cost Avoida nce, 3) Impact of unmatched lines, and 4) Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region is considered more important than other pricing e lements.<BR><BR>

Based on vendor re sponses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability.    After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria:  Generally, responses to all questions in  this section demonstrate: (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that th e line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor (PV) for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts o ff DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqua lify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	At a minimum your company must manufacture or distribute:  (All sizes below are expre ssed in inches unless otherwise identified.)  <BR>a.	Transparent Dressings:  Sizes 4x4 3/4, 5 1/2x4, 3 3/4x3 3/8, 2 3/8x2 3/4, 4x 5 7/8, 2x1 1/2, 11x16 11x4, 6x8, 5 1/2x10, 4x8.  <BR>b.	Hydrocolloid Dressings:  Sizes 6x8, 4x4.7, 4x4, 2x2 3/8, 6x6, 1 1/4x 1  1/2.  <BR>c.	Hydrogel Dressings/Fillers:  Sizes 6x6, 4x4, 8x8, tubes 1/2 oz, 1 oz.  <BR>d.	Foam Dressings:  Sizes 3 1/2x3 1/2, 4x4 1/2, 5 5/8 x 5 5/8, 7 1/2x8 3/4, 5 5/8x 6 1/8, 5 1/2x 5 1/2.<BR>e.	Alginate Dressings:  Sizes 2x2, 4x4, 4x8, 12in rope.<BR>2 .	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Advanced Wound Care product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or  show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) Your DAPA number is: __________________.  <BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the PV (currently, Europes PV is Owens & Minor) for distribution in the Europe Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.) <BR>4.	Vendors must offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note that vendors that fail to offer a discount from DA PA will be disqualified.) <BR>5.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Your company must be able to send samples to this region by U nited States Postal Service (USPS).  This form of mailing has proven to be the best at eliminating delays due to International Customs.   <BR>7.	Vendor must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delay s that occur with Europes Custom Offices.  Provide acknowledgement of this requirement with the initial submittal.<BR>8.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the Advanced W ound Care products including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  Your company must provide history of back orders and/or recalls for the Advanced Wound Care products, which will include: dates, duration, cause, and resolu tion (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR>9.	For any Advanced Wound Care products containing medication, vendors must provide products with FDA approval for use in all clinical advanced wound care settings and provide literature to support this requirement (WITH I NITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR>10.	Vendors must provide a statement revealing all products containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) clearly labeled as latex free/ safe.<BR>11.	Vendors must supply a statement demonstrating instructions/directions for use with each unit of issue and provide evidence of this with their initial submittals.<BR>12.	Vendors must provide a statement confirming evidence that products can b e delivered to a sterile field with (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR>13.	Your company is required to provide literature support showing the mechanism that ensures normal bacteria of the wound and the promotion of wound healing.<BR>14.	Vendors must provide visu al examples demonstrating product labels with visible expiration dates of at least 12 pt fonts on all exterior, intermediate and individual packaging and provide evidence of such (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Pro cess:  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will request literature and/or samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using both a literatur e review and hands on evaluation in a non-clinical setting.  As indicated in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the  following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medical Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (DSN 371-2108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Literature will be e-mailed or shipped via the same procedure as samples.  Vendo rs will be given 10 calendar days to ship samples.  Literature and samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 4:00PM EST on the 10th calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consider ation in the standardization process. Vendors must forward verification (e-mail) of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>Designated MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not accep table, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The CPT has established a target t hreshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Ta rget Threshold of 3.00.  Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.   <BR> <BR>To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical profes sionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in an inpat ient setting, if needed.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.00  <BR><BR>Hydrocolloid Dressings:<BR>1.	Dressing may be c ut to required size.<BR>2.	Skin remains intact when dressing is removed.<BR>3.	Dressing adheres to skin without rolling edges.<BR>4.	Dressing molds around uneven surfaces.<BR>5.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing has a long wear time  before required change.<BR>Transparent Film Dressings:<BR>1.	Skin remains intact when dressing is removed.<BR>2.	Dressing is available in different sizes.<BR>3.	Dressing allows removal in one piece.<BR>4.	Dressing can be cut-to-fit and shaped to cover dif ficult anatomical areas.<BR>5.	Literature supports the use of dressing with other topical medications.<BR>6.	Dressing does not have an adhesive that irritates s kin.<BR>7.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing has a high vapor transfer ability to reduce maceration of surrounding skin.<BR>Hydrogel Dressings:<BR>1.	Dressing allows visualization of wound.<BR>2.	Dressing can be removed in one piece .<BR>3.	Dressing can be cut-to-fit.<BR>4.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing allows for moisture vapor permeability.<BR>5.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing can be used with topical medications.<BR>Alginate Dr essings:<BR>1.	Dressing maintains its integrity when wet.<BR>2.	Dressing is removed from wound without irritating skin.<BR>3.	Dressing is soft and conformable.<BR>4.	Dressing is highly absorbent when it comes in contact with wound exudates.<BR>Foam Dressin gs:<BR>1.	Dressing can be cut without compromising its function.<BR>2.	Dressing can be shaped to cover difficult anatomical areas.<BR>3.	Dressing adheres to wound bed.<BR>4.	Dressing remains intact when saturated.<BR><BR>Market Search Request for Informati on:  Our clinicians are attempting to stay abreast of technological advances in this product line.  None of the information provided based on the following feedback will be used to determine technical or clinical acceptability. Please describe any features  that your products possess that use new design or technology.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process:  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data  based on a committed volume of 80% of the total  Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided ten (10) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 1 0th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further participation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluat e quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company  factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volu me for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  1) Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region (Post-Standardization Costs), 2) Potential Cost Avoida nce, 3) Impact of unmatched lines, and 4) Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region is considered more important than other pricing e lements.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Description (Request for Information)
The United States Special Operation Command (USSOCOM)is conducting a request for information for senior advisor services with experience in technical areas of concern to SOCOM.The advisor, must possess a doctoral degree in Engineering and must have served in an advisory role to other senior military commands. The advisor/firm must possess an in depth understanding of Insensitive Munitions (IM)and newly developed or product improved non nuclear munitions,as required by MIL STD 2105C.  The advisor/firm must have a working knowledge of the process involved in developing IM insensitive systems, which will reduce collateral damage in the event of an accident from unplanned stimuli.
The advisor/firm must be a recognized expert in this area and articulate with the Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Panel and the DOD Integrated Program Team (IPT) panels.  Advisor/firm must have experience in writing and assembling a Strategic Plan.  Advisor/firm must have knowledge of all munitions in the SOCOM Fiscal Year Defense Program (FYDP), and their susceptibility to IM stimuli.
Since munitions contain explosives, propellant and fuzes, the applicant/firm must have a working knowledge of insensitive explosives.  The applicant/firm must be capable of showing through publications for International Conferences and peer groups, their ability to design and develop propellant venting technologies as applied to high and mid caliber artillery guns.
Since fuzes are an integral part of insensitive munitions, the advisor/firm must possess a working knowledge of fuzing systems for mortars, artillery, rockets, bombs, grenades and other explosive devices.
Specific knowledge of power sources, both chemical and non-chemical is required to evaluate systems adherence to MIL STD 1316.  In many cases, the fuze is the road block in achieving IM compliance for a munition; the advisor must then propose new fuze designs to make the munition safer and become IM compliant.  Electronic/mechanical arming systems must be part of the advisor?s experience.  Advisors/firms must have a working knowledge of Special Forces equipment, i.e., radio transmitters/receivers, man-powered generators and training devices as applied to the soldier worn Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) harness system.
Advisor/firm must have a long term experience of military systems having contributed to these systems by means of patents, publications, reports, and physical hardware.
Interested firms, capable of supplying this service, should provide the following information: cage code, company name, address, phone number, email address, a point of contact, business size, and type of company within NAICS  541330. 
Also, contractors shall provide specific product literature with emphasis on the advisor?s/firm?s capabilities.  General company product literature will not be considered a response.  Information shall be submitted to Kenyona Wilson, Contract Specialist at Kenyona.Wilson.ctr@socom.mil or to Denise Green-Huneke, Contracting Officer at cdenise.green-huneke@socom.mil, no later than 1400 EDT on March 24, 2008.   
This is a request or information only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  This notice shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  No entitlement to payment will arise as a result of the submission of contractor information.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service seeks firms interested in providing in-kind replacement of a chiller used to cool well water for fish culture at the North Attleboro National Fish Hatchery, N. Attleboro, MA. The existing chiller was manufactured by Mechanical Resources Inc. and was placed into service in 1992. It is a model CH1RSA-25 having a capacity of 21.88 tons and a fluid pressure drop of 12 feet. The hatchery specifications call for a flow of 100 gallons per minute to be cooled 5 degrees. All parts in contact with the water supply must be stainless steel and not other materials (copper, bronze, brass, zinc, cadmium) that can leach into the water supply. The replacement chiller should show an overall net energy savings and use an EPA approved refrigerant. It is anticipated HCFC-22 (also know as R-22) can be replaced by a suitable alternative such as R-410A. Evacuation fluids, refrigerant removal, and proper disposal of the existing chiller is necessary. The NAICS code for this project is 238220. The size standard is $13 million. This procurement is set aside for small business. It will be requested that interested firms visit the site to verify the existing chiller system and to ensure the proposed replacement meets all the existing conditions and requirements. Interested firms may send company information in writing to; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Contracting and General Services, 300 Westgate Center Drive, Hadley, MA 01035-9589, Attn:  Chris Murphy, by fax to 413-253-8450, or at email: chris_murphy@fws.gov, prior to close of business on April 11, 2008.

Based upon responses received, the Government reserves the right to set aside any and all procurements that may result hereunder according to Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 19. If the evaluation of responses received concludes that none of the responding organizations have the necessary capabilities, the government reserves the right to make award to the National Institute of Building Sciences on a noncompetitive basis.

1.0	OBJECTIVE. The objective of this Statement of Objectives(SOO) is to obtain short-term microwave radio network transition engineering support for the US Forest Service (USFS). 
2.0	BACKGROUND.
2.1	Advanced Wireless Services. The US Government conducted an auction of radio frequencies (RF) in the 1.7-2.1GigaHertz range to provide additional RF spectrum for commercial carriers to offer expanded advanced wireless services to consumers. These frequencies were previously assigned in large part to Federal Government agencies. Those US Government agencies who are being required to vacate this spectrum have been provided funding from the auction to offset their network transition expenses that they previously identified to the NTIA. 
2.2	Frequency and Network Transition. Those Federal agencies that are required to vacate the spectrum that has been auctioned off have until early in 2010 to transition the radio networks to other bands. In the case of the USFS, this means migrating its microwave networks in the National Forests to either leased carrier services, or capitalize new microwave systems operating in a band 7GHz and 2.2 GHz approved for USFS use. USFS has converted a substantial amount of their communications requirements to carriers. USFS has also obtained frequency licenses in another band to support network transition of their capital microwave networks where conversion to common carrier is infeasible, or not cost-effective.

3.0	TASK REQUIREMENTS. 
3.1	General. The USFS has a remaining requirement to transition its microwave radio capital assets to an approved band at five (5) National Forests in the 7GHz band ,1 forest in the 2.2GHz band and 3 forest for microwave removal, as described further below. This task shall be broken into two component parts;
?X	Microwave Network Transition Engineering
?X	Option to Implement the Project Plan (subject to approval and funding availability).
The basic transition engineering activity shall be built around the following summary work breakdown structure (WBS) by functional area. This WBS is strongly suggested to be the index of the final Plan (not including the detailed site specific reports, analyses, and engineering acquisition packages which would be attachments to the Plan).

<DESC>Field Training and Evaluation Program
Sources Sought


The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is the security and law enforcement component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  FPS is responsible for protecting federally owned or leased facilities.  FPS' mission is to provide a safe environment in which federal agencies conduct their business without fear of violence, crime or disorder.  

FPS seeks to develop a Field Training and Evaluation Program (FTEP) to provide post-academy training to personnel newly hired into FPS Inspector positions. The development of the FTEP shall include approximately 40 hours of training in a San Jose Model Field Training Program, with additional Physical Security components, for approximately 150 existing FPS personnel to become Field Training Inspectors (FTI's) at various locations across the U.S.  The 40 hours of training should include teaching prospective FTI's to train and evaluate new personnel and provide remedial training and teaching techniques.  Additionally, the development of the FTEP includes assistance with and validation of proposed policies, forms, performance benchmarks, task lists and standard evaluation guidelines to be used in the FPS FTEP.  Currently, FPS is only looking to develop the FTEP, but the potential to administer the program exists. 

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 611430 Professional and Management Development Training, with a size standard of $6.5 million. Interested parties are invited to submit a capability statement including an expression of interest, identification of business size with respect to the NAICS code, and demonstration of capabilities/experience based on the description above.

The Government seeks to identify potential sources capable of developing the FTEP for informational and planning purposes only. This is not a solicitation for proposals, no contract will be awarded and the Government will not reimburse for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought
---------------
A.	 General Information

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Blood Collection Devices to include, but not limited to:

1.	Safety Blood Collection Needles, 21g X 11/4?, 22ga X 11/4?
2.	Safety Lancets: Finger, Heel 1mm Dx 2.5 Path Length Blade Infant
3.	Blood Collection Set 23g X 12in Tubing w/Wings Female Luer Safety
4.	Phlebotomy Tourniquets
5.	Needle Holders
6.	Blood Transfer Devices
7.	Capillary Tubes

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

    The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 4:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer. 

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated 
below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting

2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3) ? Acceptable; Four (4) ? Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors? average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors? average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.00 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. (EST) fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.    

a. In general, ?acceptability? for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
(1) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; and
(2) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of ?technical acceptability.?  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion below, as required.

The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors must provide a response to each criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Safety Blood Collection Devices products. A ?complete line of product? is defined as the MTFs? requirements for ?usage items? in the product line.  ?Usage items? are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:

1.	Safety Blood Collection Needles, 21g X 11/4?, 22ga X 11/4?
2.	Safety Lancets: Finger, Heel 1mm Dx 2.5 Path Length Blade Infant
3.	Blood Collection Set 23g X 12in Tubing w/Wings Female Luer Safety
4.	Phlebotomy Tourniquets
5.	Needle Holders
6.	Blood Transfer Devices
7.	Capillary Tubes	

Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.
2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Safety Blood Collection Devices product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
3.	Vendors must have, or be obtaining, a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Owens and Minor) for distribution in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional Prime Vendor (PV) will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors will be asked to provide an initial quote on discounts, in response to the FBO RFQ.  Vendors determined to be clinically acceptable, after clinical evaluation, may have an opportunity to submit a final quote at that time.
5.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.
6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Safety Blood Collection Devices products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.

A.	 General Information

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Blood Collection Tubes, to include but not limited to: Tubes Vacuum Blood Collection SST Safety Top Plastic, Polymer w/Clot Activator 13 X 75 and 13 X 100 Paper Labels (various sizes to include: 3.5ml, 5ml, 7ml); 
Tubes Vacuum Blood Collection Safety Top Plastic, K2 EDTA Dry 13 X 75 Paper Label (various sizes t include: 2ml, 4ml); Tubes Vacuum Blood Collection PST Safety Top Plastic, Plasma Separator Gel/LiHEP Dry 13 X 75 Paper Label (various sizes to include: 3ml, 4.5ml); Tubes Vacuum Blood Collection Safety Top Plastic, 6ml K Oxalate/NaFl Dry 13 X 100 Paper Label (various sizes to include: 6ml).  The major facilities in the area includes: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Hospital Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

    The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

Emails and correspondence may be sent to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil .

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

1.	Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting

2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3) ? Acceptable; Four (4) ? Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors? average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors? average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.00 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. (EST) fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.    

a. In general, ?acceptability? for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
(1) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; and
(2) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

a.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of ?technical acceptability.?  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion below, as required.

The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.




Vendors must provide a response to each criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Safety Blood Collection Tube products. A ?complete line of product? is defined as the MTFs? requirements for ?usage items? in the product line.  ?Usage items? are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

At a minimum, a complete product line includes:

<DESC>Nature and Volume of the Proposed Work

To perform the 2009 U.S. Department of State (Department) financial statements audit OIG needs the services of a certified public accounting firm that has professionally qualified personnel with experience in CFO audits and is able to dedicate full time, federally-experienced professional staff members from early July 2009 to early December 2009.  The Department?s assets total about $45 Billion and its annual budget exceeds $30 Billion. 

The contractor shall:

?	Determine and report on whether the financial statements and related notes present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and net position; net costs, changes in net position, and  budgetary resources, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
?	Perform appropriate procedures consistent with AICPA Auditing Standard AU Section 558, "Required Supplementary Information," on all Required Supplementary Information included in the Department?s FY 2009 consolidated financial statements.  
?	Determine whether risk-assumed information (including projections of pensions) is presented fairly in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 5, and any subsequent revisions.  If a specialist is used for this work, the auditor shall comply with guidance in AU Section 336, ?Using the Work of a Specialist.? 
?	Assess whether the other accompanying information, or its manner of presentation, is materially consistent with the information in the Annual Statements.
?	Evaluate and report on internal control and the internal control environment related to the FY 2009 consolidated financial statements for the Department.  This should include, but not be limited to, obtaining an understanding of the components of internal control, assessing the level of control risk relevant to the assertions embodied in the classes of transactions, account balances, and disclosures components of the financial statements, and performing tests of the Department?s internal controls.  
o	Review information system general and application controls in the Department?s applications that are significant to the financial statements to the extent necessary to (1) conclude whether general controls are properly designed and operating effectively, (2) consider application controls as part of the internal control assessment in the financial statement audit, and (3) support the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) assessment. 
?	Obtain an understanding of the process by which the agency identifies and evaluates weaknesses required to be reported under the Federal Managers? Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) and related agency implementing procedures.  Compare material weaknesses disclosed during the audit with those material weaknesses reported in the agency's FMFIA report that relate to the financial statements.  If material weaknesses were disclosed during the audit that were not reported in the Department?s FMFIA report, auditor will determine whether the failure to detect and report material weaknesses constitutes a significant deficiency or material weakness in the entity?s internal control.  In order to address this objective, auditor should obtain information on the Department?s efforts to implement OMB Circular A-123, Appendix A.
?	Perform tests of compliance with laws and regulations that could have a direct and material effect on the Department?s FY 2009 financial statements, including FFMIA.
?	For allocation transfers, coordinate early with ?child? agencies to ensure that adequate audit coverage will be provided.  
?	Determine whether the special-purpose financial statements and accompanying notes present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, net costs and changes in net position, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the presentation requirements set forth in the Treasury Financial Manual (TFM), Chapter 4700.
?	Obtain an understanding of internal control over the financial reporting process for the special-purpose financial statements and perform tests of those controls.  
?	Perform tests of compliance with TFM Chapter 4700.  
?	Assess the reasonableness of FY 2009 retirement, health, and life insurance withholdings/contributions, and employee headcount information provided to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as required by OMB Bulletin 07-04.  Comply with any additional guidance issued by either OPM or OMB during FY 2009.

The contractor must demonstrate that it has successfully performed agency-wide financial statement audits of large highly complex and decentralized agencies, and issued unqualified auditors? opinions on time and in full compliance with all federal government and professional standards.  It must have had these audits assessed by the Government Accountability Office to give assurance that they complied with the GAO/PCIE FAM on these audits.

Also, the contractor must demonstrate (1) its qualifications to assess the effectiveness of the Department?s information systems control environment; (2) that its IT specialists have a thorough working knowledge of FISCAM; (3) experience auditing a government agency with multiple financial management systems; (4) past experience in successfully transitioning to be the new auditor of a large complex agency; (5) experience in auditing pension funds and working with actuaries; (6) experience auditing agencies with a significant amount of grant activity; and (7) experience auditing working capital funds.
All personnel assigned to the audit must have Secret security clearances.  





Location of Work

Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Area and other domestic and foreign locations including developing states.  The Department has embassies, consulates, and other posts in over 260 locations, and processes financial data in Washington, D.C., Charleston, S.C., and Bangkok, Thailand.  Auditors will need to perform work at 8 to 10 overseas locations.   

Responses shall be ten pages or fewer.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR>A.	General Information.  <BR>The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3  and    4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treat ment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in countries of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Cuba announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the s tandardization of CSR Wraps and Packaging Supplies.      <BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at  the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical  Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Stand ardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at http s:    dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is Septembe r 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical  performance and technical  company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical  Company and Clinical  Performance evaluation factors, when co mbined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value   trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  <BR>Point of Contact:  Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil   <BR>B.	Products  and    Performance Required.  <BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of CSR Wraps  and    Packaging Supplies, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $234,627.33.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a r ecent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical  Company Criteria below.<BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conv ersion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization init iative should email their detailed responses to the technical  company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, an d E-mail address) to Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the specified closing date  time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in  the standardization process.  <BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for ema il to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm  receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date  time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified f rom further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body  of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR>The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical an d  or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 8 percent of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Not e: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the di scounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Phase I  Technical Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required certifications  and    documentation to Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet  provide responses to the te chnical  company criteria stated below.  All technical  company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical  company crit eria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified  invited to participate in the clinical  performance evaluation.  a.) In general,  acceptability  for purposes of evaluation of technical  company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on th e vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and  or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is fact ually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>NOTE: Specific technical  company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of  technical acceptability.   The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR> The following equally weighted Technical  C ompany Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of CSR Wraps and Packaging Supplies products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in  the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical  Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR>a.	At a minimum this includes CSR Wraps that are non-absorben t, with minimal  low lint, provide for a variety of sterilization methods (steam and low temperature sterilization), in a variety of sizes to include but not limited to Regular strength Wraps (sizes  are in inches: 12  x 12, 18 x 18, 24 x 24, 30  x 30, 36  x 36, 48  x 48, and 54  x 54 ); Mid-weight strength Wraps (sizes 18  x 18 , 24  x 24 , 36  x 36, and 54  x 54 );  Heavy-duty strength Wraps (sizes 18  x 18, 24  x 24, 30  x 30, 36  x 36 ,  45  x 45, 48  x 48, and 54  x 54 ); and Ultra Wraps (sizes 36  x 3 6, 45  x 4, 48  x 48, and 54  x 54 ).  This product line also includes Packaging Supplies (Peel Packs) in paper  plastic, self-sealing Peel Packs (with or without indicator strips) compatible with appropriate temperatures in the sizes of 3.5  x 8.5, 5.25 x 10.25, 7.5  x 13.5, and 12.0  x 15.5.<BR>b.	Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and st yles listed above. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>c.	Vendors MUST provide supporting documentation that all CSR Wraps  and    Packaging Supplies that are manufactured and  or distributed are F DA approved for use in all clinical settings, and provide literature to support this requirement with the initial submittal.  <BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for CSR Wraps and Packaging Supplies.  Provide the DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors who do not have a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the Southeast Regions prime vendor is Owens  and    Minor) for distribution in the Southeast Region.  P rovide supporting documentation (four digit code) with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.)   <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products includ ed in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  V endors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III wi ll be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendors MUST have a local vendor representative for the Southeast Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors MUST provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with initial submittal.  <BR>6.	Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the CSR Wraps  and   Packaging Supplies products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>7.	V endor MUST provide Latex free  safe products.  Vendor MUST provide a complete list of latex safe  free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to RFQ with initial submittal.  <BR>8.

Vendor MUST provide products that have a barrier material which is impermeable to liquids and microorganisms.  Provide supporting documentation with initial submi ttal.  <BR>Phase II  Clinical  Performance Evaluation Process.  Following acceptability of the technical  company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation. Vendors are required to ship their samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM EST, on the (14th) calenda r day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, product s, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  <BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical  performance cr iteria in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-most acceptable and five (5)-highly accept able.  All clinical  performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical  performance evaluation period will last for 15 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Avcceptability of products for standardization.   The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any  break  in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and wil l be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation  criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting.   <BR><BR>The following Clinical  Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR>1.	Vendor products meet th e Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0 <BR>2.	When applying to appropriate items, the sterilization wrap conforms smoothly without stretching or tearing.  <BR>a.	The Wrap must be strong, flexible and remain intact through out the sterilization pro cess for sterility of the package to be maintained.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial for regular strength wrap, mid-   strength wrap, and  heavy duty strength wrap; at least one (1) trial for each pouch size in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.	<BR>c.	Each wrap will be applied according to manufactures guidelines, and visually inspected for conformity, stretching and for tears; each  pouch will be filled according to manufacture guidelines, and visually inspected for stretching and for tears.<BR>3.	Sterilization wraps resist saturation and any penetration of liquids.<BR>a.	CSR Barrier must effectively resist saturation and   or any li quid penetration to maintain package sterility. <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial for all wrap strengths in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.<BR>c.	The CSR Wrap will be inspected a sterilization process cycle for visual sign s of moisture and  or wetness.<BR>4.	Sterilization peel packs (pouch) seals are consistent, strong and minimizes any shattering or tearing.<BR>a.	Sterilization peel packs (pouch) must remain intact to prevent contamination.<BR>b.	This criterion will be eva luated one (1) trial for each pouch size in the non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.<BR>c.	The sterilized pouch will be visually and physically inspected for closure integrity any tears to pouch.<BR>5.	Sterilization peel packs (pouch) when peeled apart , provide a clean separation of the film from the paper, maintaining the sterile integrity of the contents.<BR>a.	The adhesive film on the peel pack (pouch) must not come in contact with package content to maintain sterility of package content.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial for each pouch size in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting. <BR>c.	The evaluator will peel the processed pouch and visually inspect for adhesive film on pouch paper and for film on pouch contents. <BR>Phas e III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical  performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold (-- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the locatio n of any  break  in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores) as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80 percent    o f the total Regional requirement.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability thresho ld will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price q uotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration   participatio n.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices a s the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request  revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>Clinical  perform ance and technical  company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical  Company and Clinical  Performance evaluation factors, when combine d, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardiza tion Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing .  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Li nes.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to t he region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  <BR>(4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of  clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Notebook Filters to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>Proposed addition of Notebook Filters to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.

This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Notebook Filters by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Filter, Notebook, Privacy Filter
7520-00-NIB-2005 (13.3?W)
7520-00-NIB-2006 (19.0?W)
7520-00-NIB-2007 (20.1?)
7520-00-NIB-2008 (20.1?W)
7520-00-NIB-2009 (22.0?W)
7520-00-NIB-2010 (24.0?W)

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Notebook Filters to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Stock numbers for similar products are:

3M Brand:			KanTek Brand:			ViewGuard Brand:				
PF12.1				KTKSVL12.1				VG-11210
PF12.1W			KTKSVL12.1W			VG-11215

PF22.0W								VG-02130A
PF24.0W								VG-02205A
									VG-02405A


In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Notebook Filters to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 4, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Colored Recycled File Folders to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>Proposed addition of Colored Recycled File Folders to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.

This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Colored Recycled File Folders by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

File Folder, Colored Recycled
7530-00-NIB-0866
7530-00-NIB-0867
7530-00-NIB-0868
7530-00-NIB-0869

7530-00-NIB-0875
7530-00-NIB-0876
7530-00-NIB-0877

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Colored Recycled File Folders  to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Stock numbers for similar products are:

<SUBJECT>Sole Source Notice for OARDEC FOIA Services
<DESC>The proposed action is for the procurement of  FOIA services to support the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants which the Government intends to solicit only one source, WR Systems, LTD.  The incumbent, WR Systems, LTD provides support for time-sensitive FOIA requests, completes Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) and Administrative Review Boards (ARBs) and is fully trained in preparing highly information-sensitive FOIA requests for OARDEC.  Additionally, WR Systems is fully trained in REDACT express, a FOIA software program.   WR Systems has become the subject matter expert  on which parts of OARDEC's mission the FOIA documents pertain, and to what end certain documents may be released.   This is a tedious and meticulous review process which is essential in keeping OARDEC and the DOD out of future litigation.  Retaining WR Systems would avoid set backs in an extensive training curve for new personnel as well as the time consu!  ming requirement for obtaining secret clearances and approvals through DOD, avoiding unacceptable delays, which would be detrimental to OARDEC's overall mission.   The Office of the Staff Judge Advocate of the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants (OARDEC) requires on-site management support and services to manage the receipt and processing of requests for information in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). These services are integral to the proper management of requests received by OARDEC pursuant the FOIA.  Specifically, the Contractor shall support the receipt, research, organization and release of FOIA information to include the following: 1.  Review and analyze requests for information as they are received. This task will involve liaison with DoD officials to request, receive, and guide the analysis of the information.  2.  Draft an interim response to requests in accordance with FOIA statutes and the Department of !  Defense (DoD) guidelines, and forward unexpurgated documents to the St aff Judge Advocate for review and approval.  3.  Serve as liaison with DoD officials and assist in FOIA litigations when requests for OARDEC documents are subjected to judicial review.   4.  Assist with the preparation of correspondence, affidavits and responses to judicial subpoenas or court orders regarding access to information pursuant to FOIA.  5.  Review outgoing correspondence for accuracy and quality.   6.  Perform general administrative tasks including maintaining task suspense calendars and other functions to support timely responses to FOIA requests, judicial subpoenas and court orders.  7.  Perform other administrative and analytical functions as requested.  Interested persons may identify their capability to provide these services.   This notice is not a request for quotes, however, all capability information received by 28 March 2008 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to issue a competitive solicitation based upon respon!  ses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government and capability information received will be solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Offers shall be received at FISC Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Division, Bldg. 2B, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111 no later than 4 PM (local time) on 28 March 2008 .  All responses may be emailed to Joyce Kichman at joyce.kichman@navy.mil or faxed to (215) 697-9742.

The requested items are to be used in high altitude parachute operations or in support of those operations.  The items have been tested and evaluated in the past and th e indicated manufacturers equipment has superior quality in material and workmanship as well as having met the required safety factors necessary in daily rigorous high altitude parachute operations. These items have met the rigid performance, durability a nd uniformity of parachute mains requirements for the team.  These items are patented and have been tested and evaluated to meet specifications. Test and evaluation of generic items would require a minimum of 60 to 90 days and the only time period availabl e for testing is during the months of January to March. The mission of the USAPT would be drastically impaired if tested generic items did not meet our strict specification. The unit currently has components and repair parts valued at over $125,000 for the  indicated manufacturers canopies.  Purchasing a generic brand would not be cost effective and it would cost the unit in excess of $35,000 for components and repair parts. This is not a request for Competitive Proposals.

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>Delivery shall be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO).<BR><BR>CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>As the Contracts Officer Representative (COR) for the various software products used in the Department of Stateýs Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS), I recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the purpose of purchasing from HL Group, Inc. an extended warranty for Data Collection Advantage for PeopleSoft (DCA/PS), Asset Advantage terminal licenses and ongoing custom development and tailoring related to these software products.  I further recommend that warranty, licenses and ongoing technical support services be purchased for a base year and for two option years. The subject action would be a new contract.  Previously, the purchase of products and services from HL Group has been undertaken by Accenture, a contractor retained by the Department of State to design, develop and deploy the Department's Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS).  It is in the best interests of the State Department to directly purchase the software licenses as well as the warranties, service and support agreements essential to the ongoing operation of ILMS.  It is contemplated that this will be accomplished by means of a firm fixed price contract.   As it is currently designed and configured, ILMS requires the following: a.	Data Collection Advantage for PeopleSoft b.	Advantage Asset Terminal Licenses  c.	Loftware LPS Enterprise Edition; and  Custom Development & Tailoring  The accomplishment of this procurement action without undertaking full and open competition is justified by the fact that there is only one responsible source for these products and services -- there are no other suppliers or services that will satisfy the State Department's requirements.  The statutory authority is found in 41 USC 253(c) (1) and in FAR 6.302-1.<BR><BR>The products and services that are to be purchased from HL Group are crucial to the ongoing operation of the Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS).  ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system.  ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000.  ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System.  In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, Accenture selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by HL Group.  ILMS will not function without these components. Specifically, the Data Collection Advantage for PeopleSoft (DCA/PS) software application that is utilized in ILMS is the only certified bar code solution for use with PeopleSoft Inventory, Manufacturing and Purchasing. It was a joint development effort between PeopleSoft and HighJump Software (formerly known as Data Collection Systems, Inc.) It is re-certified with every release of PeopleSoft applications. HL Group has a contract with HighJump Software as its sole distributor of DCA/PS for the government market The Data Collection Advantage for PeopleSoft and the Asset Advantage software modules utilized in ILMS are customized off-the-shelf software. The software and the customizations have been developed solely by HighJump Software, LLC and HL Group.  Maintenance support or modifications to the software by any third party was specifically prohibited under the terms of the design and development contracts executed by  HL Group and Accenture (operating as the State Department's contractor for the design, development and deployment of ILMS).<BR><BR>Now that ILMS is fully deployed, it is desirable that the State Department take over the various license and support agreements underlying ILMS.  This will lessen the Department's reliance on Accenture for ongoing maintenance and support of ILMS and the risk that accompanies such reliance.  Although it would theoretically be possible to hire another contractor recreate the design and development work that was previously undertaken jointly by HighJump Software and PeopleSoft, such an effort would be lengthy, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for licenses and support.  Moreover, a decision not to procure licenses and support from HL Group would have an immediate adverse impact, disabling major components of ILMS.  This acquisition will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is anticipated that, due to the factors described above, there will be little or no competition for this acquisition. The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost is fair and reasonable. Market research indicates that there are no commercial or nondevelopmental items that would satisfy the State Department's needs.   The software and support services provided were specifically designed to perform crucial functions within the existing production version of ILMS.  The overriding need for software components and support services that do not compromise ILMS functionality cannot be restated in a way that would permit the use of commercial or nondevelopmental items. In the course of the development of ILMS, the Government made a serious effort to assure that Accenture, as the prime contractor, obtained as much competition as possible in subcontracting components of the task -- such as the software customization and support  contracts that it executed with HL Group. To date, no sources have written to express an interest in this acquisition. When the Government assumes responsibility from a contractor for software licenses and support requirements that are integral to much larger IT systems, it is effectively precluded from competing the periodic renewal of such licenses and support agreements -- particularly if the systems involved have been customized and involve numerous proprietary components.  The best alternative available to the government is to negotiate and contract for long-term license and support agreements at the offset.<BR><BR>

FDA will award a purchase order to a responsible vendor whose quote is the lowest price meeting or exceeding the required technical factors.  In order to be considered for award the vendor must submit with their quote documentation supporting that their product meets the following technical factors and sub factors:

Technical Factors: 

1. Provide a GUI to manipulate input data to send to web service.
2. Provide ability to save and reuse multiple test cases and data sets (i.e. csv, xls, database) for regression testing.
3. Supports complete test workflow from simple single service tests to complex scenarios and multiple service endpoints. 
4. Data-driven testing through data sources (Excel, CSV, Database Queries, etc). 
5. Provide ability to collect and report testing metrics.
6. Provide ability to view, modify and verify SOAP request and response messages in real time.
7. Provide ability to validate XML Schema and WSDL.
8. Provide ability to efficiently debug and unit test code in development phase as well.
9. Provide ease of adapting testing requirements to changing web service standards and protocols.
10. Provide ability to emulate completes business processes through chaining multiple web service calls.
11. Provides ability for functional, regression, performance, load, interoperability and vulnerability testing.
12. Must be compliant with section 508 standards: 1194.21, 1194.22, 1194.31 and 1194.41.

Technical Sub Factors:

1. Can be pointed at a WSDL; the tool will crawl it and build a set of positive and negative tests for each Web method on the WSDL, resulting in quicker and further progress of the testing effort from the very beginning of the testing process.  
2. The tool's auto-generated tests, are instantly executable and are actual tests, rather than empty test skeletons. Each test node in the tool's explorer is accompanied by a "traffic object" subnode that retains the most recent request/response pair generated by that test. So you can execute a test, then click on the traffic object to examine the exact exchange.
3. Tool provides for a quick and easy manipulation of project-wide behavior. 
4. The tool allows users to trace the execution of Java applications at the JVM level (without a need to change any code or to recompile), and in the context of a larger integrated system. In addition, the tool increases efficiencies in evolving the system functionality with little or no regression testing  by executing existing test case scenarios while the business application is being traced, and then establishes a snapshot of the current functionality to serve as a regression baseline for these scenarios.

Delivery of the product will be FOB destination. The contractor shall deliver the product to 5600 Fishers Lane, PKLN RM9B45 HFC-32, Rockville, MD 20857 no later than seven days after receipt of a purchase order.

The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC).  

Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (JUN 2003). This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. The contracting officer will review the vendor's online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

Solicitation number is HSCG85-08-Q-625590 is issued as a Request for Quotations.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

Evaluation Factors for Award:  
The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer is the Best Value, cost and other factors considered.  The technical and past performance factors, factors a. and b. below, combined are significantly more important than price, and are listed in descending order of importance.  However, price may become a critical factor in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical and past performance factors.  Evaluation of price will be based on the offeror?s total price for all line items as delivered to NH Pensacola, FL, and Norfolk, VA.

The Factors identified below are in descending order of importance and will be the evaluation factors used to evaluate all offers received:
a. Technical - Offerors shall provide in sufficient detail a technical proposal that shall meet or exceed each of the requirements of the salient characteristics.
b. Past Performance - Offerors shall provide at least three past contracts of similar size and complexity held within the last three years.

c. Price ? Offerors shall provide a firm fixed price for all line items, including delivery.

The offeror?s initial proposal shall contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.   The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest offeror if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the highest rated offeror.  The Government reserves the right to make no award as a result of this solicitation. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Items.

The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Integrated Genomics, Inc., for renewal of ERGO Server License, Update, Gene Expression Module, and Genomic Data Supplement in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a Notice of Intent (NOI-RML #8012).  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24 dated 2/28/08. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541711 and the small business size is 500. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories(RML), is in need of a ERGO license renewal.  RML has sequenced several pathogen genomes.  Determining the chemical sequence of the DNA of the pathogenic organisms is a critical first step in the development of diagnostics, vaccines and chemotherapeutics against deadly human pathogens.  A critical aspect of sequencing and processing of the data from multiple bacterial genomes is the use of servers and bioinformatics software to store, analyze and present genome data.  The RML currently has an  ERGO server on site for the processing, storing and presentation of bacterial pathogen genome data.  This RML ERGO server and the software that runs on it needs to be covered by a service and support contract to supply unlimited phone and email support, quarterly data updates, an ERGO gene expression module and a genomic data supplement.  The contractor shall provide to RML a 1(one) year License Renewal, including 4(four) quarterly data updates of existing genomic data, all new public genome data added to the ERGO database throughout the year, and proprietary customer data from any sequencing and annotation projects performed with Integrated Genomics.  Any software improvements to the core system shall also be provided at the time of update. This renewal includes unlimited phone and e-mail support, experienced bioinformatics and software development teams.  Integrated Genomics shall include 8(eight) hours of web-ex based demonstrations and training.  Data files must be compatible, transferable to and readable by a contractor-supplied server with ERGO bioinformatics software and RML computing systems and infrastructure which involves PC, MAC and Unix/Linux-based systems.  The RML ERGO server consists of the ERGO Genome Analysis Suite. The contractor shall provide all personnel for the work effort. The contractor shall work closely with RML IT staff members to insure the server is properly updated and that RML IT guidelines and security measures are met. The contractor shall keep all NIH, RML-derived data secure and will not release, make public or maintain any of the RML data beyond this contract effort. If Internet connectivity is needed in order to perform the work, for transfer of files, or other efforts, contractor computers will be secure and in compliance with RML-IT security procedures and policies. Contractor supplied software shall be kept current and up to date with applicable security patches and upgrades.  Internet connectivity and/or remote access for the purpose of performing the work, for transfer of files, or other efforts, will be coordinated with NIAID IT staff to ensure security and compliance with NIAID IT procedures and policies.  The contractor shall provide to the RML Project Officer contact information for the Project Manager that will oversee the service support contract.  The Contractor shall produce/provide the following deliverables: l) Unlimited phone and email support for the RML ERGO server and software for one(1) year.  2) 4(four) quarterly ERGO database upgrades for genomic data in the public domain, genomes already present on the RML ERGO server, and all genomes performed at RML. The first quarterly updates shall be scheduled immediately upon receipt of the licensing fees and Rocky Mountain Laboratories shipping information.  Subsequent updates will be delivered at approximately 60(sixty) business day intervals following the first update. This upgrade for all publicly available genomes shall be completely compatible with the infrastructure and format of the RML ERGO server.  Cross genome comparative analysis must be available, prediction of translation starts, sequence similarities, functional annotation, and orthologous cluster analysis.  Additional methods that rely on gene context rather than on sequence similarity must also used for annotation of those genomes. 3)ERGO gene expression module for integration of micro array data (spotted and Affymetrix chip data) into gene function and context pathways.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/request for proposals for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Government intends to award a fixed price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract as a result of this solicitation.  This solicitation will incorporate provisions and clauses that are in effect through the latest Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24. The North American Industry Classification System code is 621511 with a Size Standard restriction of 12.5 million dollars.  The period of performance is one year from the date of award.  The place of performance is the contractor site.  VHA requires a Center for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS) deemed status contractor that can supply a proficiency testing program for all regulated, waived and unregulated analytes.  The contractor must have a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments 1988) approved proficiency testing program.  The contractor must provide the number of challenges for each analyte as described in 42 CFR Part 493 as amended.  Assay materials shall be provided to each laboratory no less than three times per year for regulated analytes upon a schedule established by the contractor.  All material shall be shipped postage paid using the United States Postal Service except when premium transportation is required due to the nature of the assay material (refrigeration etc.).  Premium transportation, if required, will be priced at the time of shipment.  The contractor shall provide an opportunity for each lab to participate in an interlaboratory comparison program with the other laboratories.  Each laboratory must be able to compare its assay results with peer laboratories using the same instrument/reagent system. This testing must be performed on every instrument (including backups) utilized for patient testing and for every site where patient testing is performed in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW).The approximate number of facilities and CBOCS that are performing patient testing is 700.  The overall purpose of this task is to obtain a contractor that will provide proficiency testing to all VHA medical laboratories.  The contractor must have deemed status from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The contractor shall provide a detailed summary report of laboratory results to the Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service (P& LMS) National Enforcement Office electronically in a Microsoft Access database compatible format.  This report should include at least the following: Analyte tested; Testing methodology; Numerical/Qualitative results submitted by applicable laboratory; Percentage Grade (for each analyte ad the overall survey score); Mean for applicable assay; Standard Deviation for applicable assay; Range for the assay; Intended Response.  The contractor must provide the results of the proficiency testing to VHA P&LMS National Enforcement Office, the appropriate Regional Commissioners' office and the laboratory.  The contractor shall provide survey results for each test within 45 days of the closeout date (established by the contractor) in the Microsoft Access database Office format (2003) currently used by the program office. These evaluations will include a summary of performance over the past three mailings for regulated analytes minimally.  If results are unacceptable, each report shall be appropriately annotated based upon the recommendations of scientific resource committees for each discipline represented by the survey program.  The contractor shall provide a HCFA/CMS Performance Summary Scorecard on each laboratory following each shipment for regulated analytes.  The process must provide a tool for monitoring the effectiveness of current methods as well as the selection of new methods. The following provisions are incorporated by reference: 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, the following instructions are added as an addendum to this clause: Submit offers in two separate volumes as follows: Volume I, Technical Proposal - Provide evidence of deemed status by CMS for laboratory proficiency testing for all regulated analytes as defined by 43 CFR 493 and the ability to provide the desired reports.

<DESC>*****************************************************************
THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO POST QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IN REGARDS TO THIS SOLICITATION AND TO EXTEND THE SOLICITATION RESPONSE DUE DATE UNTIL 3:00PM CST, 26 MARCH 2008.


1. If B210 (dual hydraulics) cannot be substituted and the only difference between a Huey II and UH-1H/Bell A-1 is the engine, will the government allow the use of UH-1H or is the engine pertinent to this requirement.

NO, THE UH-1H IS NOT A SUITABLE SUBSTITUE.


2. The PWS Section 1.3.2 and Attachment 2 do not specify the level of experience of the students for the Maintenance Training. Can you provide this information?

STUDENTS WILL BE EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONALS WITH AT LEAST 5 YEARS EXPERIENCE WORKING ON HELICOPTERS.


3. PWS 1.3.1 and Attachment 1 specify aircrew training to be provided for "pilot and flight engineer instructors".  We presume that both the pilots and FE's will receive the same academic course per CLIN 0001 or CLIN 0002, as appropriate. Please confirm.

YES, ACADEMIC TRAINING IS THE SAME FOR PILOTS AND FLIGHT ENGINEERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH CLINs 0001 AND 0002.


4. Please define what the crew duties of the "flight engineer" are. Is he a co-pilot or something else. The US Army had no flight crew member of a Huey designated other than pilot or co-pilot. For purposes of CLIN's 0003 and 0004  (Flight and Simulator training) what is the specific training requested, if any, for the flight engineers? There is no guidance in Attachment 1 that we can discern.

FOR FLIGHT ENGINEER DUTIES, PLEASE SEE THE FOLLOWING:  TOLD (TAKEOFF AND LANDING DATA), PREFLIGHT, CHECKLIST MONITORING (PILOTS READ IT THEMSELVES BEING A SINGLE PILOT AIRCRAFT AND ALL), SCANNING AND CALLING THE APPROACHES. IN ADDITION, ANY AIE (ALTERNATIVE INSERTION AND EXTRACTION) WORK WOULD BE DONE BY THE FLIGHT ENGINEER IN THE BACK OF THE AIRCRAFT (HOIST, FAST ROPE, ETC).  FOR CLINs 0003 AND 0004, FLIGHT ENGINEER TRAINING CAN BE CONDUCTED BY GOVERNMENT/MILITARY INSTRUCTORS, AS REQUIRED. GOVERNMENT/MILITARY INSTRUCTORS WILL BE PROVIDED ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS.  FLIGHT ENGINEERS WILL NOT REQUIRE CONTRACTOR AIRCRAFT/FLIGHT TRAINING FROM CLINS 0003 AND 0004.  THEY WILL ONLY REQUIRE GROUND TRAINING.


5. The notional schedule for training per Amendment 0001 includes an initial class of 1 pilot and 2 flight engineers. For this class, (or others where there may be a larger number of FE's than pilots, what would be purchased under CLIN''s 0003 or 0004 for this class, if it was tasked with those type students? See also in relation to questions 1 and 2.

FOR CLINs 0003 AND 0004, TRAINING WOULD BE PURCHASED ON A PER PILOT BASIS ONLY. FOR THE FIRST CLASS, WE WOULD ONLY PURCHASE ONE UNIT OF TRAINING FROM CLIN 0003 OR CLIN 0004.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE FOR THE FLIGHT ENGINEERS AS THEY WILL NOT REQUIRE AIRCREW/FLIGHT TRAINING FROM THE SUCCESSFUL OFFEROR AS STATED IN THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ABOVE. 


6. 1) Is a UH1H model acceptable as a training aircraft for the tasks below; Could you answer each line item individually? a) Basic Instrument and Day VFR Flying, b) Instrument procedures, c) remote/unprepared surface operations, d) Night/Instrument flight rules (IFR) operations.

NO, WE REQUIRE ALL FLIGHT TRAINING TO BE IN A HUEY II OR 205++ AIRCRAFT.


7. In the tasks section, page 4 of 6, it states that the contractor will provide accountability for the students. Can you define what kind of accountability the government expects from the contractor?

AS PROVIDED IN PARA 1.3.6 OF THE PWS, ?THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE THE QAE AND AETC/A3RE WITH A REPORT OF ANY STUDENT ABSENCE BY APPROXIMATELY 1200 CST OF THE NEXT TRAINING DAY FOLLOWING THE ABSENCE.?


8. Does the Government prefer to do this training CONUS, or OCONUS?

THE PWS ALLOWS FOR PROPOSALS FOR TRAINING IN OR OUTSIDE OF THE US.


9. If OCONUS, what region/country would the government like the training conducted in?

THE PWS ALLOWS FOR PROPOSALS FOR TRAINING IN OR OUTSIDE OF THE US.


10. If OCONUS, will the government provide country clearances, visas, and local airspace orientation flights?

THE GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE CLEARANCES/VISAS.  LOCAL AIRSPACE ORIENTATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE FLYING TRAINING SYLLABUS PROVIDED BY THE CONTRACTOR.


11. If OCONUS, can the government state the number of hours being flown by military and civilian personnel for area orientation, so that may be included in the total fixed price for flight hours.

LOCAL AIRSPACE ORIENTATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE FLYING TRAINING SYLLABUS PROVIDED BY THE CONTRACTOR.


12. If CONUS, our two primary training areas are El Paso Texas, and the Mojave Desert, Ca. Would either of those locations be acceptable to the government?

THE PWS ALLOWS FOR PROPOSALS FOR TRAINING IN OR OUTSIDE OF THE US.


13. Does QAE stand for Quality Assurance Evaluator, if not what does it stand for?

YES.  QAE STANDS FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE EVALUATOR.


14.  Is the HQ AETC approved HUEY II syllabus available on-line?

THERE IS NO AETC APPROVED HUEY II SYLLABUS ? THE PWS (1.2.2) STATES THE CONTRACTOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING THE SYLLABUS IAW THE PWS AND FORWARDING IT TO HQ AETC FOR APPROVAL.
