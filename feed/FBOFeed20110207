However, although the sustainment activities are firm, the development tasks may be deferred to a later date or may not be executed due to funding or timing constraints. Given these conditions, would your company find it worth the effort to submit a proposal? 
REQUIRED PERSONNEL SKILLS:  Tc data migration; helpdesk; Tc product structure; requirements refinement; schedule; multiple function integration by various contracted entities; security; DoDAF architecture; use case development; contractor project management functions; Tc testing; knowledgeable of the CIE process; deficiency reporting; software configuration and development; and conforms/complies with Local Systems Engineering Process (SEP), as well as PLM environments, are required.

As an example, a help desk must be located in a NATO member country and manned by NATO member nationals with NATO SECRET security clearances.

The IFB to be issued for this acquisition will be identified as IFB-CO-12846-PIA. All correspondence concerning this solicitation should reference this number.

The envisaged method of bidding will be International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures.  The evaluation of bids will be conducted in accordance with the procedures and practices for conducting ICB using Best Value Evaluation methodology. 

The estimated value of this project is 4,055,975 (2,978,003 estimated PIA Gateway one-time plus one year service cost and 1,077,972 estimated Enterprise Services Component cost)   The amounts of the bids submitted in response to the IFB shall not exceed 125% of the authorized amount for the project. 

Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from the closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a bid guarantee of 100,000.

The contract period of services is estimated at three years with additional two year extensions as evaluated option.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The purpose of the contract is to procure reliable, secure, resilient, and managed Internet Gateway Services on NATO sites (on-site outsourcing) to satisfy the full operational requirements of the user community to access Public Information Services. The PIA gateway services include but are not limited to relating, protecting, and filtering internet access (browsing, web publishing, extranet) and internet e-mail traffic to and from the connected Commands.

The PIA Gateways shall be integrated into the NATO network environment and configured and sized such that they can seamlessly take over the functions and traffic load of another PIA gateway in case of failure.

Provision of inter-PIA gateway connectivity and connection to internet services to ensure the required service availability and performance levels shall be the service providers responsibility.

In addition, the contractor shall be responsible for providing, installing, and integrating the Enterprise Service Capability for providing Network Operating System (e.g., Windows Active Directory Single Forest Single domain), Global Address List (GAL) and Enterprise E-mail services.

<DESC>BLM Request for Proposals, L11PS00054, TECHNICAL REVIEW OF THE WILD HORSE AND BURRO PROGRAM. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Operations Center (NOC) intends to award a sole source contract to National Academy of Sciences, Office of Contracts & Grants, 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001 for the continuation of a study of the science, methodology, and technical decision-making approaches of the Wild Horse and Burro Program.  In evaluating the program, the study will build on findings of three prior reports prepared by the National Research Council (NRC) in 1980, 1982, and 1991 and summarize additional, relevant research completed since the three earlier reports were prepared.  Section 1333 of the 1971 Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act (WFRHBA) provides the BLM with the authority to consult with individuals independent of Federal and State government who have been recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, and other individuals determined to have scientific expertise and special knowledge of WH&B protection, wildlife management and animal husbandry as related to rangeland management.  The success of any strategy the BLM develops hinges on our ability to bridge the many divergent and conflicting perspectives about how the Wild Horse and Burro Program should be managed in the West.  These differences have led to an increasing number of appeals, litigation, congressional inquiries, and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.  Many feel the BLM is not credible and does not apply the best science in managing Americas Wild Horse & Burro Program.  The recommendations that the NAS provides would benefit the BLM as we continue to work closely with Congress, the public and our stakeholders to identify strategies for the future management of the Wild Horse and Burro Program in the West that enjoy broad-based support.
A cost-type contract is anticipated, with a delivery date of the final published report of no later than twenty-four months after award of a contract.  The contractor must gather data and provide reports that will address the following key scientific challenges:  Estimates of the WH&B populations; Population Modeling; Genetic diversity in Wild Horse and Burro herds; Annual rates of WH&B population growth; Predator impact on Wild Horse and Burro population growth; Population control; Immunocontraception of wild horse mares (porcine zona pellucida);   Managing a portion of a population as non-reproducing; AML Establishment or Adjustment; Societal Considerations; and Additional Research Needs. 
All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by the BLM. Send information for technical evaluation to Steve Santoro at (303) 236-3518 by March 24, 2011.  See Note 22.

Project 534-09-103, Repair and replacement of a section of the underground domestic water supply system loop to the VA Medical Center. A portion of the cast iron loop has a break/rupture between isolation valves. The exact break/rupture point has not been determined as it is located under pile supported concrete parking deck; that section of the loop has been isolated. Work will involve installing the new water main in the crawl space under the 1st floor suspending it from the concrete floor overhead.  The new piping will be tied into the existing outside the buildings footprint and the abandoned services restored to the new line.  The Medical Center is currently supplied from the undamaged portion of the supply loop. The water supply system for the medical center runs underground beneath city streets, driveways, sidewalks, and parking lots and is pile supported due to settlement issues.  Electronic metering and system monitoring is also included. 

The existing 10-inch perimeter water loop around the VA Hospital is supported by pilings and pile cap system. In order to reduce the potential differential movement of the existing water system and proposed water system during a seismic event the new water line construction must be supported by pilings and pile cap.

New work will consist of the patch/repair of any surfaces affected by the demolition and/or construction to support the new water main. Skill trades required for this project includes mechanical, interior and exterior underground domestic water plumbing, piling, and concrete.
 
Provide construction services to provide a finished project in accordance with the plans and specifications.
The Contractor shall complete the construction within 12 months of the notice to proceed.
The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000.00 and $2,000,000.00.  Consideration is limited to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses, and the solicitation will be issued using the Sealed Bid Process.  The bids shall be hand delivered or mailed to the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC, 109 Bee Street, Charleston, SC  29401-5799.  All bids must be received at the time and date of the bid opening or before.

The NAICS Code for this requirement is 238220 and the Small Business Size Standard is $14 Million.  This notice is issued subject to the availability of funds and is not a request for proposal.  The solicitation will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities Website.

<DESC>TITLE:  MARKET SURVEY - NEXT GENERATION TRAFFIC ALERT AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM
ANNOUNCEMENT:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a future requirement for technical and analytical services to support the development and testing of the next generation Traffic Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS).  We are considering one or more five-year contracts estimated at a total of not more than $17 M and are seeking information on potential bidders.
This public announcement is being in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.3.12.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is an informational announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents at this time.
The following North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are considered the most applicable and appropriate for this procurement:  541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, designated small business at 500 employees; 541330 - Engineering Services at $4.5 M except Military and Aerospace Equipment at $25M; 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting services, designated small business at $6.5 M; and 541618 Other Management Consulting Services at $6.5M.
A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate the exclusion of that vendor's from the competition.  However, the failure of adequate small business participation in this market survey would result in the government determining there are not sufficient qualified and interested small business firms to justify setting aside this procurement for small business.  
Interested companies can register for future announcements related to this and any procurement by Going to the FAA Website address:  "http://www.asu.faa.gov/faaco/index.cfm, which is the FAA "Contract Opportunities" site.  Should you want the E-mail automatic notification of FAA opportunities you may look under the column "Main Menu" and click on E-Mail Auto-Notify System.
PURPOSE:
The purpose of this market survey is to gain a better understanding of the industry and potential offerors.  Specifically we are seeking to:  1) information concerning the organizations who wish to support future FAA Next Generation TCAS efforts and the breath of experience and capabilities that they can offer; 2) comments on the Statement of Work; and 3) information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition - full and open competition; limited competition; or sole source.
The FAA will consider the information provided from this survey in developing our acquisition strategy, contract vehicle type(s), quantities, and whether the acquisition(s) should be open competition, limited competition, small business set aside, or sole source procurement.  Due to the nature of the work and the interaction among the various components of this work, the FAA anticipates a single contract award.
BACKGROUND:
The Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, TCAS II Version 7, known internationally as the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS II), was released in 1998 and incorporated significant operational and technical improvements over the previous version (6.04A).  The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandated ACAS II equipage in ANNEX 6, Part I, chapter 6.18 by January 1, 2003 for certain operators internationally.  This mandate elevated ACAS II as the worldwide collision avoidance standard.
It has recently been recognized that the current TCAS design may not be sufficiently flexible to adapt to the evolving National Airspace System (NAS), as reflected in the Joint Planning Development Office's (JPDO's) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) Concept of Operations, and the Operational Evolution Partnership's (OEP's) NextGen Solution Sets, as well as recent modifications that have been made to the TCAS logic.  Many elements of the current TCAS design date from the 1970s and 1980s, and reflect older methods of airspace use (i.e. air traffic control provided separation based on radar data, rigid route structures, airborne surveillance of Mode C and Mode S transponders providing range and altitude but not a target's identity or intent, no performance-based flight profiles, and no situational awareness or separation tools in the cockpit).  As a result, the current TCAS model may not be compatible with future NextGen envisioned procedures (i.e. continuous descent approaches (CDA), curved Required Navigation Performance (RNP) approaches, closely spaced parallel runways approaches, aircraft-based merging and spacing, closer parallel en route operations, lateral passing maneuvers in non-radar airspace) and additional collision avoidance functionality may need to be implemented as a means for addressing these envisioned shortfalls.
As new procedures are developed to support NextGen, collision avoidance will need to evolve to work in concert with these procedures.  In the near term, minor changes to TCAS may be sufficient to support smaller mid-term operational changes.  However, it is likely that collision avoidance will evolve and become an integral part of an air-to-air systems capability; thus, the distinction between "collision avoidance" and "separation assurance" may become blurred as these systems evolve.
The Draft Statement of work (SOW)  shown below states the technical areas in which the contractor will support the Federal Aviation Administration.  A Screening Information Request (SIR) is anticipating being released in 2011.  We are considering use of a Cost Reimbursement, "Cost Plus Fixed Fee" type contract(s).  The government estimate for this procurement is approximately $17 Million over a 5 year period.  
SCOPE OF WORK AND CAPABILITIES:
Section A.  Technical Capabilities.  The FAA anticipates a need for contractor support in the following areas:  
1.  In accordance with a specific TCAS Change Proposal, the contractor will do the following:
	Develop pseudocode for the TCAS Change Proposal.	Translate the pseudocode-based changes into statechart-based changes.	Implement the pseudocode-based changes and the statechart-based changes.	Analyze the TCAS Test Suite coverage.	Develop new Test Cases as necessary.	Compare the pseudocode-based changes and the statechart-based implementations.	Validate that the proposed change to the TCAS CA logic will actually solve the problem it was intended to solve.	Verify that the proposed change to the TCAS CA logic will not create other problems.
2.  Update the TCAS Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) in accordance with the validated TCAS Change Proposal.
3.  Support NextGen TCAS development to include the identification of areas for TCAS improvements and develop the required change proposals.
Section B.  Organizational Characteristics.  The FAA requires contractor support that is independent and non-proprietary in behavior and performance, from contractor(s) that do not have a vested interest in any ultimate technology solutions to be adopted by the FAA.  NOTE:  Winning bidder(s) will NOT be eligible to participate in any equipment manufacturing, equipment deployment or fielding of final systems.
Section C.  Business Capabilities.  The respondents should have the following business capabilities:
1.	Present capability to provide the required services.  Present capability includes experienced and qualified staff members (presently on staff or under binding contract) who are able to support the scope of Work and Capabilities.  Responses should include the total number employees (prime contractor and subcontractors), the numbers of employees (employed/under contract) with capabilities to support work in each of the six support services areas defined in the scope of Work and Capabilities, and their associated labor categories.2.	Financial ability to cover payroll and other operating and administrative expenses to accommodate Government "in arrears" payments for work performed for periods up to ninety days.3.	An existing line of credit (specify the amount), or appropriate assurances that the responder would be able to obtain a line of credit (specify the amount) prior to contract award.4.	Recent experience in contracting with the Federal Government.  Experience prior to August 1, 2004 will not be considered recent.5.	Accounting system accepted by Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) or some other Government-approved auditing organization.
Note:  The FAA will consider making award to only those offerors with acceptable and adequate financial and accounting systems (preferably systems that have already been audited by DCAA) which are considered acceptable to support award of a cost reimbursable contract.  Offerors must provide the name and phone number for the DCAA Audit Office that conducted the most recent audit of the offeror's financial and accounting systems or an indication that they have not yet been through a DCAA audit.  The FAA expects to award a cost reimbursable contract as the result of a screening information request (SIR).  Therefore, the contractor must have adequate financial and accounting systems to support cost accounting required for a government cost reimbursable contract.  If an offeror has not yet been audited by DCAA, the FAA will either request audit(s) upon issuance of SIR or at time of actual contract award (in which case the contract award would be conditioned upon receiving positive audit findings from DCAA).

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br /> Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National 	Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, 	Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis with the iMedRIS Data Corporation, 625 E. Carnegie Dr., Suite 105, San Bernandino, CA 92408 for electronic protocol submission to the IRB (NCI-IRB) and the Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee Review Board Operations for the National Cancer Institute - (NCI-IACUC).
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541519 and the business size standard in $25M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:  Performance shall be for twelve months from date of award with two 12 month option periods.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire the following:<br />1)	Purchase a second module of the Integrated Research Information System (iRIS), Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC).  The ACUC module will be assimilated with the existing IRB Assistant<br />2)	Purchase software development enhancements/changes to the current CCR IRB Assistant module. <br />3)	Purchase annual license and maintenance in support of the two iMedRIS modules, the existing IRB Assistant and the ACUC modules.</p>
<p>In an effort to upgrade the NCI-IRB, the Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) purchased the Integrated Research Information System (iRIS) electronic document management system from the iMedRIS Data Corporation in the fall of 2005. The purpose of this purchase was to transition from a paper-based system to electronic system which improved the quality of clinical research protocol submissions, expedited the review and approval timeline and to increase both institutional and individual study compliance of all research activities that fall under the Protection of Human Subjects -45 CFR 46 (Office of Human Research Protections - OHRP and 21 CFR 50 and 56 (Food and Drug Administration - FDA). The system has been implemented.  Upgrades and maintenance are required on an ongoing basis as the expected level of performance and level of use has risen significantly.  At this time, the CCR has decided to expand this standard to the NCI -IACUC by purchasing and implementing the IACUC module from iMedRIS in conjunction with the existing iRIS electronic document management IRB module.</p>
<p>To incorporate a corporate electronic management system is the first step to accomplish greatly increasing the consistency of research regulatory submissions and establish increased quality control over both business and regulatory processes. The iRIS system has streamlined workflow and increased capacity and functionality while at the same time reducing redundancy. In order to support this objective, the NCI, OCD would like to purchase and implement the IACUC module and complete the upgrades and modifications of the IRB module.  The new module will be assimilated with the existing IRB Assistant and therefore must be compatible with the existing system.  The iRIS ACUC is part of the suite of software products and is a known entity that is compatible with our existing system.  iRIS is proprietary software owned and developed by iMedRis.  They are the experts for this software and they now have a complete understanding of the NCI IRB's processes and needs which makes iMedRIS uniquely qualified to provide this system and maintenance.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>NASA/SSC has a requirement for the extension of Facility Operating Services (FOS)to the Mississippi Army Ammunition Plant (MSAAP) upon completion of the transfer from theArmy.  FOS anticipated for MSAAP include:  1.) Management, labor, facilities, materials,and equipment necessary to provide facility operating services to include: engineeringservices; institutional services; facilities maintenance and operations; safety andmission assurance; environmental services; occupational health; logistics andmaintenance; and administrative services.  This includes a full range of managementduties, including project management, configuration management, planning, scheduling,work control, report preparation, safety and quality control and 2.) Resolution ofunusual and emergency situations, such as: hurricane preparation and recovery support;fire fighting support from construction activities; and recovery from tornadoes, any oneof which may occur from time to time throughout the period of performance. NASA/SSC intends to award the facility operating services on a sole source basis inaccordance with FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies orServices Will Satisfy Agency Requirements" to SSC Facility Operating Services (FOS)Contract (NNS07AB21C) with Jacobs Technology Inc. (JTI), for the provision of facilityoperations services to the former Mississippi Army Ammunition Plant (MSAAP) from July 1,2011 to August 27, 2012.  In 2005, the MSAAP was placed on the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) list as a DODfacility to be closed within the 6-year window stipulated by the BRAC 2005 legislation.The NASA SSC requirement driving this procurement action is the need to providecontinuity of tenant hosting and facility operations and maintenance from the outset ofNASA ownership of the facility (through an agreement between NASA HQ and the Army signedon November 8, 2010), to begin on June 30, 2011.   In order to meet the requirements ofthe MSAAP Transfer Agreement and maintain continuity of operations, NASA SSC must have aFacility Operating Services contractor for the MSAAP in place prior to this June 30, 2011transfer date.	  Jacobs Technologies, Inc. is presently providing all required services for NASA SSC andall of its tenants under contract # NNS07AB21C; this contract was awarded from a full andopen competition in 2007.  NASA has a need to secure an interim FOS contractor for MSAAP,to provide uninterrupted services to the existing MSAAP operations, at the time ofownership transfer to NASA.  It has been determined to be in the best interest of thegovernment to modify NASA SSC's existing FOS contract with Jacobs Technologies, Inc. forthese services to the MSAAP for fourteen months (July 1, 2011 to August 27, 2012) whichcorresponds to the remaining earned period of performance on the current contract.  NASAviews this award as a bridge term to allow sufficient time for NASA to fully understandthe requirements of the Army Ammunition Plant and develop an appropriate solutionconsistent with the SSC Master Plan.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform thiseffort in writing to NASA-John C. Stennis Space Center, Office of Procurement Attn:Adrianne Peyton, Stennis Space Center, MS 39529-6000 not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon February 22, 2011.  Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely forthe purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitivebasis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a fulland open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within thediscretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.The anticipated release date of this Request For Proposal is on or about February 28,2011 with responses due NLT 4:30 pm on March 28, 2011. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.   The installation Ombudsman is KenHuman, ken.r.human@nasa.gov, 228-688-1128.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Walla Walla District has a requirement for a Performance Oriented Construction Activities (POCA) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple-Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) with capability to award design build construction projects.<BR>  <BR>The purpose of the MATOC is to provide a variety of design and construction services including but not limited to the following:  repair and maintenance of real property, environmental work, incidental services, force protection work, property repair and maintenance, habitat restoration (environmental work), new construction, and renovation.  <BR><BR>Use of the MATOC provides a construction product delivery method that utilizes industry innovation, can accommodate quick and straight-forward projects, as well as some small but complex projects, can help minimize design effort and related overhead expenditures, as well as handle compressed schedules while reducing acquisition-related lead time.  Projects may range from those where the government provides full design (Design-Bid-Build) to those with limited design and functional specifications requiring the contractor to complete the design and construct the project. <BR> <BR>This procurement is an SBA certified HUBZone Small-Business set-aside.  This requirement will be awarded using a Best Value, two-phase design-build process in accordance with FAR 15.101-1 and FAR Subpart 36.3.  <BR><BR>Two solicitations will be issued in sequence consisting of a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) during Phase One and a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Phase Two.  <BR><BR>In Phase One an RFQ will be issued requesting qualification proposals from interested HUBZone firms based on the overall MATOC scope of work.  Not more than the seven (7) most qualified firms will be selected to submit Phase Two proposals based on the following Phase One evaluation criteria:  design-build experience, past performance, and management approach. <BR><BR>No pre-proposal conference/site visit will be conducted during Phase One. <BR> <BR>The Phase One Request for Qualifications will be issued on or about February 22, 2011-not less than 15 days from the date this notice is posted.  <BR><BR>In Phase Two, an RFP will be issued to up to the seven (7) most qualified offeror's selected in Phase One.  The RFP will include the scope of work for the first Task Order, Task Order 0001, to be awarded under this contract(s). <BR>    <BR>Phase One evaluations of qualification proposals will not be utilized in the Phase Two trade-off evaluations and Best Value determinations.  All contract requirements will be detailed in the RFP using the USACE Contract Format consisting of the following sections:  00010- Solicitation/Contract Form, 00100-Schedule/Instruction to Offerors/Evaluation Factors for Award, 00600C-Representations and Certifications, 00700-Contract Clauses, 00800-Special Contract Requirements, 01000-Division 1/General Requirements, and 16999-Division 2-16/Technical Provisions.<BR> <BR>A pre-proposal conference/site visit may be conducted during Phase Two.<BR><BR>Phase Two offerors will have not less than 30 days to provide their proposals.  Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of a technical and price proposal based on the aforementioned Task Order 0001 project. <BR> <BR>Proposals received in response to the Phase Two RFP will be evaluated in accordance with source selection procedures outlined in FAR 15.305.  Up to four (4) MATOC contract awards will be made to the offerors whose total evaluated price and technical proposal provide the best value to the Government.  Only one firm will be awarded the first Task Order (Task Order 0001) as a result of this RFP.<BR>     <BR>It is the Government's intent to award up to four (4) IDIQ contracts to the offeror(s) whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value.  Task Orders will be awarded on a firm-fixed price basis.  The value of each Task Order is expected to primarily be below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT), $150,000, but the Government reserves the right to issue Task Orders valued up to $500,000.  <BR><BR>MATOC Scope of Work <BR>A.	Performance Period:  One year base period and three twelve-month option periods.<BR>B.	Maximum Contract Value:  The total dollar capacity shared between firms will not exceed $6 million dollars.  The annual aggregate amount is estimated at $1,500,000.  Any unused capacity in one period may be carried over into the subsequent contract period.  <BR>C.	Minimum Guarantee:  The minimum guarantee amount for the entire life of the contract for each IDIQ awardee is $10,000.<BR>D.	Task Order Limitations:  The minimum Task Order value is $2,000 and the maximum Task Order value is limited to $500,000.<BR><BR>General:  Task Orders will primarily address general public works construction and renovation including but not limited to the following:  dams, roads and pavement construction and repair, general environmental work, incidental minor construction, excavation, plumbing, demolition, electrical, structural, mechanical, concrete work, environmental remedial work and other presently unforeseeable requirements that may arise.  Projects will generally be design-build, requiring some element of design for various construction types, but may include projects in which the Government provides a full design.  The awarded IDIQ's will not be utilized for AE design only requirements that do not involve constructing the completed design.  Task Orders may be issued for construction work in which no design is required.  Task Order projects may be non-complex performance oriented tasks requiring minimal design, or they may be complex construction Task Orders requiring design development for design-build construction, or a combination thereof.  Task Order Proposal Requests (TOPR) may or may not include traditional plans and specifications or may include sketches and other informational submittals. <BR><BR>"Design-Build" is defined for solicitation purposes as a project in which the contractor is provided less than a full design and is required to complete the design.  This includes participating in design review and total construction of the designed project. <BR><BR>Placement of Task Orders:  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by a USACE Contracting Officer who will issue written Task Orders to the IDIQ awardees.  Prices will be requested and evaluated for each Task Order in accordance with FAR 16.505.  Each individual TOPR will state the evaluation criteria for Task Order award.  Individual Task Order awards may be evaluated on price only or price and other non-cost evaluation factors as outlined in the TOPR.  Whenever possible, award will be made without discussions. <BR><BR>Area of Responsibility:  The MATOC work will primarily be geographically located throughout the Walla Walla District area of operations, principally Washington, and work concentrated at Mc Nary (Washington and Oregon), Ice Harbor, Little Goose, Lower Monumental, Lower Granite, Dworshak (Orofino, Idaho) and Lucky Peak (Boise, Idaho) Dams.  The Walla Walla District's civil works boundaries generally follow the Snake River drainage and include approximately 107,000 square miles in six states: Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, and small parts of Nevada and Utah.  Work may include additional project locations within the Pacific Northwest covered by USACE Seattle and Portland Districts.  The Government reserves the right to issue additional solicitations and award additional contracts for the same or similar work within the area covered by this MATOC.  This is not a solicitation for a Requirements Contract.  <BR><BR>Task Order 0001:  The Government intends to award Task Order 0001 for the design completion and electrification of the storage building at Ice Harbor Lock and Dam concurrently with the MATOC awards.  The project includes minor construction consisting of electrical design completion and interior electrical construction.  In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of this first Task Order is between $25,000.00 and $100,000.00.  This Task Order will be awarded on the basis of price and technical criteria.  The primary NAICS Code for Task Order 0001 is 238210, Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors; with a small business size standard of $14 million.<BR><BR>Award of the first IDIQ and Task Order 0001 will be made to the Offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the best overall value to the Government based on the evaluated ratings from the Phase Two proposals. The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer or to reject all offers. The Government will not award a contract to an Offeror whose proposal contains a deficiency, as defined in FAR 15.001. <BR><BR>The Contracting Officer will award the subsequent IDIQ contracts to the Offerors whose proposals are considered to represent the remaining best value to the Government based on the evaluated ratings from Phase Two. <BR><BR>Joint Ventures (JV)<BR>A joint venture is defined as follows:  a legal business entity formed between two or more companies (parties) to undertake the performance activities of a contract together.  This does not include other arrangements such as "teaming agreements" or "strategic alliance", which are not recognized as bona fide joint ventures for the purposes of this solicitation.  <BR><BR>A company that is part of a joint venture must submit a legally binding joint venture agreement.  The Government will not evaluate the capability of any contractors that are not included in the joint venture agreement.  Joint ventures must include a copy of the legal joint venture agreement signed by an authorized officer from each of the firms comprising the joint venture with the chief executive of each entity identified.<BR><BR>If submitting a proposal as a joint venture, the experience, past performance, and management plan of each of the joint venture partners can be submitted for the joint venture entity.  The experience for each joint venture partner will be considered the experience of the joint venture entity.  Page and project form limits apply to the joint venture as a whole.  Prospective Offerors that submit Phase One proposals may not change their firm (including LOC's and proposed sub-contractors) or their Joint Venture firms, if selected to submit Phase Two proposals.  <BR><BR>Credit for Subcontractor Experience; Letter of Commitment (LOC)<BR>If an Offeror wishes to be credited with a subcontractor or supplier, i.e. a firm that is not the prime contractor or part of the joint venture, a letter of commitment signed by the subcontractor and the prime contractor must be submitted.  The commitment letter must be submitted even if the firm is in some way related to a joint venture partner (for example, the subcontractor is subsidiary of a joint venture partner, or a subsidiary of a firm to which the joint venture partner is also a subsidiary).  In regard to Experience, if an Offeror submits projects demonstrating experience in one of the factors, and that project was completed by a subcontractor, a subsidiary, or a supplier, as opposed to the prime or one of the joint venture partners, the Offeror MUST submit a signed letter of commitment from the contractor who performed and completed the work.  If a letter of commitment is not submitted, the experience will not be considered.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) only. This Sources Sought synopsis does not constitute a formal solicitation, Request for Proposal (RFP), or a promise to issue a formal solicitation or RFP. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to ultimately award a contract. This is for planning and market research purposes only and shall not be considered as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis. No proprietary data should be submitted in response to the synopsis. Any costs associated with responding to this synopsis will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this synopsis does not preclude participation in any future potential solicitation or RFP. Any submissions will be considered to be public information. Responses will not be returned.
<p>The information provided in this synopsis is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.</p>
<p>1) Introduction<br />The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) is seeking to identify qualified sources capable of satisfying some or all of the requirements for a Multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction capability.</p>
<p>2) Capability Goals<br />The chief goals of the multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction capability are:<br />&bull; Provide a means to record multiple classification level multimedia inputs of ongoing operations at various operational nodes throughout the United States and Canada<br />&bull; Provide expedient and effective capture, storage, search, retrieval and analysis of multimedia inputs<br />&bull; Support and enhance event reconstruction processes<br />&bull; As requested, support DoD Forensic Enterprise (DFE) initiatives</p>
<p>3) Key Functions<br />The key functions within the multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction capability include data conversion (as necessary), authoritative timing system, data management and analysis, and data storage.</p>
<p>This capability is needed to ensure the multimedia data surrounding an operational, training, test, or exercise event is captured. This data can be used to re-create, examine, and analyze the event to determine event sequences and actions that took place. The multimedia event reconstruction capabilities can provide valuable analysis tools, leading to significant improvements in operational performance.</p>
<p>Multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction analysis provides the capability to conduct end-to-end reconstruction and visualization of operational, training, exercise, and test events. Potential multimedia inputs include:</p>
<p>Data Audio Video<br />Multiple command and control Common Operational Picture (COP) sources; Chat logs (e.g., Jabber, mIRC), Email activity, SharePoint, Event Logs, Audio/Video Controller logs. Multiple voice sources: Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN), Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), secure telephone, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phones, approved cellular phones (e.g. blackberry), Integrated Intercom. Multiple information system sources: Common Operational Picture (COP) displays, Decision Support Systems, and event tracking applications available at operator consoles and knowledge wall screens. <br />Video Teleconference (including desktop systems)</p>
<p>The capability should ideally provide audio, video, and data collection and distribution capabilities. This includes accepting inputs from a variety of audio, video and data devices, performing the necessary media and format conversions, and providing the distribution and delivery means. Data distribution can be via a dedicated or private IP based network or via dedicated switching technologies. In order to analyze and manipulate stored data, all inputs must be referenced to a common timing source. In addition, the file structure and storage mechanisms must support metadata tagging, advanced queries and search functions. Finally, analytic tools to allow integrated reconstruction and visualization of events must be provided.</p>
<p>4) Design Requirements<br />a) Standardized Approach - Since there are many distributed nodes, a standard approach to implementing multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction is needed. For example, deciding to store inputs in digital formats instead of analog provides a much richer set of commercial products to develop and deliver the desired capabilities. Avoid implementing a site specific solution at each node without having established common standards and formats. <br />b) Interoperable - The degree to which data needs to be exchanged and readable between nodes is an important question. Use of proprietary data formats may be acceptable if there is sufficient support for industry standard formats as well. Each may play an important and separate role within the system or at a particular node. For example, proprietary formats allow efficient storage of large numbers of video streams. However, it is highly desirable to export and share data using any web-browser or multi-media player.<br />c) Information Assurance - The operational requirement has been established to operate the multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction capability as a dedicated network at the TS/SCI classification level. This means that adherence to the DOD DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTIVE 6/3 - PROTECTING SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION WITHIN INFORMATION SYSTEMS (also known as DCIDS 6.3) is required. <br />d) Scalability - Since the delivery of multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction capabilities will be phased in over a period of time, the system must be scalable in terms of the number of operational nodes, input feeds, multimedia types and formats, data storage capacity, and processing.<br />e) Time-synchronized - A key capability is that all data feeds must be time stamped to a single time source. The granularity of how often data is stamped and the size of the data to be stamped is a design detail, but time stamping is essential to allow automated reconstruction and facilitate search and query capabilities.</p>
<p>5) Requested Information:<br />Prospective sources, possessing the qualifications, capability, and experience to respond to this RFI, in part or in whole, are invited to submit documentation in response to items listed under section 1 thru 4 above and outlining the following items:</p>
<p>a) Company information, which includes point of contact, address, type of company, size and level of facility clearance;</p>
<p>b) Description of experience in the field of multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction;</p>
<p>c) Description of potential technical approaches, and solutions that will satisfy the goals, objectives, and design requirements of a multimedia recording, storage, and event reconstruction capability;</p>
<p>d) Description of any teaming considerations/arrangements/strategies to address support of RFI requirements;</p>
<p>6) Submission Instructions:</p>
<p>a) Interested parties are requested to respond to this synopsis inclusive of answers to the requested information listed above.</p>
<p>c) Responses shall be in Microsoft Word compatible format and are due on or before 3:00 PM (local Eastern Time), Tuesday February 22, 2011.</p>
<p>d) Responses to this RFI may be evaluated by Non-Government technical experts. All non-government support personnel have signed and bound by the appropriate non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The Government may also use these selected support contractor personnel as technical advisors in the evaluation of responses.</p>
<p>e) No proprietary information should be provided in the response. Be advised that no submissions will be returned. All submissions will be disposed of in accordance with NORAD and USNORTHCOM organizational discretion.</p>

 Deployment of Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Systems into Green Communities

I.  BACKGROUND

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) are supporting the use of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies as part of a communitys overall energy efficiency, conservation and renewable energy portfolio.  This support includes assisting communities that have existing energy efficiency plans, greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction plans, sustainable energy plans and the like in place to incorporate hydrogen and fuel cell technologies as another option to achieve energy savings and GHG reduction goals.  This support also includes identifying opportunities for education and outreach to increase the publics awareness of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies.

Green communities can be thought of as residential, mixed-use, light commercial, municipal, or state sites, as examples, that have made a documented commitment to mitigating their environmental impact (reducing their carbon footprint, increasing their energy efficiency, decreasing their resource consumption rate, and installing renewable energy).  This effort will help communities accomplish innovative projects that integrate hydrogen and fuel cell technologies with other complimentary energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy investments.  Communities and industrial partners within community project teams that have already established energy efficiency plans, GHG reduction plans, sustainable energy plans, and the like are especially encouraged to respond to this Sources Sought notice.

DOEs Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) Program included $3.2 billion in 2009 Recovery Act federal funds to deploy the cheapest, cleanest, and most reliable energy technologies we haveenergy efficiency and conservationacross the country.  The goals of this Program were to reduce fossil fuel emissions; reduce the total energy use of the eligible entities; improve energy efficiency in the transportation, building and other appropriate sectors; and to create and retain jobs.  This Sources Sought notice seeks to leverage the energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy investments already made in communities by identifying potential projects for integrating hydrogen and fuel cell technologies into a communitys existing energy efficiency and conservation plan to increase the communitys energy savings and environmental benefits.

II.  OBJECTIVE

This Sources Sought notice seeks to identify communities and industrial partners within community project teams that already have energy efficiency and conservation plans, and that are capable of leveraging their previous work for deployment of hydrogen and fuel cell systems.  This program will *NOT result in a grant or financial assistance agreement*. Rather, based on the responses received to this Sources Sought Notice, NREL anticipates issuing a formal Request for Proposals, which will require both cost and technical proposals from selected responders.  The proposals received in response to the formal Request for Proposals (RFP) will be evaluated according to the terms of the RFP only, and negotiations may be conducted toward award of a subcontract with one or more successful offerors.  Subcontract reimbursement will be based solely upon the successful completion of tasks and accepted deliverables that will be specifically defined in the Statement of Work.  As potential Subcontractor(s) to NREL, successful offeror(s) shall be required to accept and comply with all of NRELs established Subcontract Terms and Conditions.  

III.  POTENTIAL PROJECT AREAS

Examples of projects that could be considered for subcontracting opportunities generally include the following:  (These examples are provided solely to guide responders, and are not intended to limit or restrict responses to this Sources Sought Notice.)  

Example 1:  An off grid community has just completed an extensive energy efficiency, time of use, and conservation study followed by an implementation program that has resulted in a 40% reduction in energy consumption by the community.  Now the community has adopted a plan to generate 80% of their remaining energy needs from clean energy sources.  The analysis conducted to baseline the communitys reduced energy usage profile has also identified opportunities for leveraging clean energy sources available in the community.  The analysis indicates that biogas from an anaerobic digester located in the community could be used to used to operate a fuel cell system to generate electrical power and high quality heat needed by the community.  The low quality heat and exhaust gas (rich in carbon dioxide and moisture) from the fuel cell system could also be integrated with a community greenhouse used to produce fresh vegetables for this off grid community throughout the year.  The value of this potential project to the community is measured in terms of contributing to the communitys clean energy plan, reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and increased local food production with a decreased carbon footprint.  

Example 2:  A technology campus has an environmental mandate to improve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions by 50%.  Retrofitting the existing buildings with energy-saving measures has resulted in a 30% reduction in energy consumption; however, more improvements are still required to satisfy the mandate.  Additionally, this environmental mandate must be balanced with the business mission of the community which requires continuous, reliable, high quality power.  A proposed fuel cell system could provide continuous backup power to critical business operations and protect this community from power grid failures that would result in economic losses.  Additionally, analysis shows that the fuel cell system would contribute to satisfying the communitys base electrical load requirements during normal power grid operation with improved energy efficiency and decreased GHG emissions relative to the grid-supplied power.  The value of this potential project to the community is measured in terms of increased power security for the communitys business mission, and contributes to the communitys mandate for improved energy efficiency and reduced GHG emissions. 

Example 3:  A group of mixed-use buildings in an urban setting has banded together to form a community and implemented a district heating and cooling network based on an advanced hydronic loop system.  This community has reduced its overall thermal energy requirements by 30% and reduced GHG emissions by 20% relative to its previous levels by implementing this technology.  However, the community still has thermal and electrical energy needs that are not being met by onsite generators, and the communitys sustainable energy plan calls for installing on-site generators that operate with greater energy efficiency and lower GHG emissions than power delivered via the grid from a coal-fired power plant.  Further analysis indicates that a fuel cell co-generation plant could provide sufficient electric power and heat to meet the communitys requirements.  The value of this potential project to the community is measured in terms of achieving energy efficiency and GHG emission goals adopted in the communitys sustainable energy plan.

Example 4:  A municipality has defined a plan for becoming a zero net energy community.  The municipality has already leveraged federal funds and private foundation grants to greatly reduce community needs for vehicles, thermal, and electrical energy.  Renewable energy investments in the municipality are not capable of reliably meeting all of the communitys energy requirements during peak consumption periods, even with the reduced demands resulting from the existing energy efficiency and conservation investments.  The municipality has analyzed its energy consumption profile and identified a system capable of integrating with the existing renewable energy generators to produce hydrogen from renewable sources for use as an energy storage media.  The communitys plan for achieving net zero energy status includes the acquisition of a fleet of fuel cell powered buses in the near future.  In order to accommodate this future hydrogen demand, the system will be sized to produce sufficient hydrogen to fuel these buses.  The value of this potential project to the community is measured in terms of achieving its goal of becoming a zero net energy community and reducing GHG/air emissions.

Example 5:  A community with excess renewable energy production is forced to curtail production when the grid is saturated.  Installation of an electrolyzer would allow the community to store and sell excess renewable energy production in the form of renewably produced hydrogen.  The electrolyzer would generate a new revenue stream for the community by selling the excess hydrogen as fuel to a distribution warehouse located in the community with a fleet of fuel cell powered material handling equipment.  The value proposition for the community is justified by more fully utilizing existing renewable energy investments to shorten the financial payback period on these investments, and increased revenue for the community.  The use of renewable hydrogen by a local employer increases public awareness of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, and also provides a unique and valuable identity for a business located within the community.

IV.  QUALIFICATIONS

Communities, organizations, and industrial partners responding to this Sources Sought Notice must describe specific capabilities, attributes, and skills directly related to the following areas:

1.  Community adoption of plans and strategies for GHG reduction, energy efficiency, conservation, clean 
     energy and renewable energy.
2.  Ability to articulate a hydrogen or fuel cell project that leverages and integrates with the existing energy 
     efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy investments in the identified community.
3.  Description of the value and benefit of the proposed project to the community.
4.  Described knowledge of and means of providing the proposed hydrogen and fuel cell technology.
5.  Ability to conduct high profile public outreach and education activities that increase the publics 
     awareness of the hydrogen and fuel cell technologies.

V.  RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS

<DESC>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business or HUBZone small businesses capable of removing the currently existing 3000 gal LN2 high pressure tank. The vendor will replace that tank with a 6000 gal high pressure LN2 tank. The tank will be painted cream to match the window trim on the Building. The tank will be bolted to the concrete pad according to the NIH supplied instructions. The tank will be connected to the LN2 evaporation system adjacent to the high pressure LN2 tank that evaporates LN2 thereby converting it to gaseous nitrogen which is connected to and supplies the gaseous nitrogen plumbing system in the Building. The 6000 gallon tank will be connected to the "telemetry unit" that measures the level of LN2 in the high pressure tank and triggers automatic refill orders as the level gets low. The 6000 gallon tank will be connected to the dual tank filling system which permits the delivery of LN2 to the high and low pressure tanks directly from the street where the delivery truck can park. We will require that the new 6000 gal high pressure tank have the necessary metering and gauges so personnel in the Building&nbsp;can read the level and gas pressure in the tank at any time. This request is for interested firms with the capability of providing the required equipment listed above are requested to submit a capability statement to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the programs described above. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 423450 with a size standard of 100. All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business. Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (a) capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not to exceed 15 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements above. Your capability statement, not to exceed 15 pages, should include references. Capability statement must be received at the address identified in this synopsis by no later than 10 days prior to close of business (12:00 P.M. local time at designated location) on February 16, 2011.

<DESC>Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. <br />
<p><br />Background<br />The Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) is a division of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. It was formed in 1986 as a part of the effort to address the national research needs created by the advent and spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Specifically, the Division's mission is to increase basic knowledge of the pathogenesis, natural history, and transmission of HIV disease and to support research that promotes progress in its detection, treatment, and prevention.</p>
<p>DAIDS continues to place priority on developing new biomedical approaches for preventing HIV infection. Approaches currently under investigation include vaccines, microbicides that can be delivered topically at the site of sexual transmission, pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs administered to HIV uninfected people at high risk for infection, and strategies to decrease viral exposure within a community by identifying and treating more HIV-infected people in that community (e.g. "test and treat").</p>
<p>To assess safety and efficacy of these approaches, HIV-uninfected volunteers are needed to participate in clinical studies. It is essential that study participants reflect the demographics of the epidemic in HIV prevention studies, particularly efficacy studies of biomedical prevention interventions. Experience has shown that achieving this representation can be a particular challenge in the United States, partly due to mistrust of clinical research and lack of accurate information among highly HIV-affected communities. While progress has been made in recent years, it has become clear that long-term effort is needed to achieve representation proportional to the epidemic and to sustain ongoing engagement of these communities.</p>
<p>NIAID has worked since 2000 to educate U.S. populations about HIV vaccine research, first through the HIV Vaccine Communication Campaign, and beginning in 2006 through the NIAID HIV Vaccine Research Education Initiative (NHVREI). In 2011, NIAID intends to award the successor to NHVREI and expand the scope to include education about all types of biomedical HIV prevention clinical research rather than focusing solely on HIV vaccine research. The goal of NHVREI's successor, the Biomedical Prevention of HIV Research Education Initiative (B-PHRE, pronounced "be free"), is to create an enabling environment for biomedical HIV clinical prevention research, including vaccine research, particularly among those U.S. populations most affected by HIV/AIDS. B-PHRE will conduct a national program to raise biomedical HIV prevention research literacy among highly HIV-affected U.S. populations and to foster ongoing interactions between thought leaders of these populations and HIV biomedical prevention researchers. For the B-PHRE Funding Opportunity Announcement, please see Appendix 1.</p>
<p>The NHVREI project also had a companion evaluation contract, a NIAID GSA contract #HHSN266200600024T awarded to NOVA Research Company. Its objectives were to design a program evaluation plan for NHVREI, and conduct the evaluation to inform the implementation of NHVREI and other related NIAID-sponsored research education activities. The contractor designed the evaluation plan, developed data collection instruments, and prepared packages to request clearance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to conduct surveys and focus groups. The key impact evaluation tool is a survey of key influencers of the NHVREI target populations to assess their awareness of HIV vaccine research and their level of support for HIV vaccine trial participation. In addition, the contractor designed a household survey to assess awareness, understanding, and level of support for HIV vaccine and other biomedical prevention research. The household survey is designed around a nationally representative sample, plus oversampling of African Americans, Hispanics, and gay men, currently the three most highly HIV-affected populations in the United States. The results of the household survey can not only inform the evaluation of the NHVREI project, but may also provide baseline data on which to evaluate the follow-on B-PHRE project. Neither the key influencer survey nor the household surveys has been completed at the time of this announcement, but the evaluation plan and the complete OMB packages are provided in Appendix 2 and 3.</p>
<p>NIAID anticipates, depending on the overall plan and approach selected for implementation of B-PHRE, that it will be feasible and desirable to adapt and apply the NHVREI Evaluation plan, indicators, and data collection instruments to the B-PHRE evaluation.</p>
<p>Scope<br />The Contractor shall be responsible for designing and implementing a process/outcome evaluation to assess the implementation process and impact of the B-PHRE on knowledge, understanding, and supportive attitudes towards participation in HIV prevention clinical research among the U.S. populations most heavily affected by HIV/AIDS. The U.S. populations most affected by HIV/AIDS are indicated by surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (see http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/index.htm for more information). The Contractor shall be required to collaborate with the B-PHRE awardee and an Evaluation Stakeholder Committee assembled with the assistance of the DAIDS Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). This contract includes a base period for the conduct of a feasibility study and design of a program evaluation plan, and options to be exercised at the Government's discretion to 1) conduct a program evaluation and 2) conduct a population-based survey.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />In collaboration with the implementer of B-PHRE (to be named) and DAIDS/NIAID, the Contractor shall develop measurable program objectives, design and implement an evaluation plan, conduct data analysis and report findings on an ongoing basis during the five and one-half year contract period.</p>
<p>The contract will include a base and two options which may be exercised at the discretion of the Government. The tasks to be performed during the base period and options are described below:</p>
<p>Base Period: The Contractor shall provide professional and technical support to DAIDS and the implementer of B-PHRE related to program evaluation. Specifically, the Contractor shall perform a feasibility study and develop an Evaluation Plan for the B-PHRE that clearly identifies evaluation questions related to program goals, measures to be used, data collection and analysis requirements, and reporting activities. The Evaluation Plan shall identify appropriate process and outcome measures to assess the effectiveness of the B-PHRE activities and approaches over the five-year grant period. The Contractor shall receive input on the Evaluation Plan from the implementer of B-PHRE and designated stakeholders, including but not limited to the DAIDS Clinical Trial Networks conducting biomedical HIV prevention research.</p>
<p>Option 1: The Contractor shall be responsible for implementing the Evaluation Plan, including conducting process and outcome evaluations of B-PHRE activities throughout the option period. The Contractor shall collect program data from the implementer of B-PHRE and analyze such data as required. The Contractor may also be requested or required to collect qualitative and/or quantitative data related to B-PHRE program activities without the assistance of the implementer of B-PHRE. This may require utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods. The Contractor shall comply with all survey (OMB), human subjects (IRB), and Privacy Act guidelines. Information collection from human subjects (e.g. interviews, surveys, focus groups) cannot commence until clearance is granted by the Contracting Officer and COTR, if necessary; this may affect timeline and price. Some evaluation activities may require Spanish translation.</p>
<p>Option 2: Conduct a representative population-based survey of knowledge about, understanding of, and attitudes towards biomedical HIV prevention research. The survey questions and sampling frames should largely overlap with those employed in the household survey conducted by DAIDS in 2010, so that changes in survey responses over time can be assessed. It is permissible to eliminate questions deemed uninformative and to add questions as deemed appropriate according to information needs and survey feasibility. Any changes to the survey questions should be developed in close consultation with the COTR.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance<br />The NIAID anticipates awarding a cost reimbursement, completion contract on August 1, 2011 to one organization that meets the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements of the solicitation. The contract will include a base period for the conduct of a feasibility study and design of a program evaluation plan, and options to be exercised at the Government's discretion to conduct 1) a program evaluation and 2) a population-based survey. The maximum period of performance, if all options are exercised will be 5.5 years.</p>

The WWR provides and facilitates assistance to wounded, ill, and injured Marines, Sailors attached or in support of Marines units, and their family members, throughout the phases of recovery in order to assist in rehabilitation and transition.  Currently, mission requirements within the WWR are expanding and reliance on industry to provide the technical skills needed to meet the unique challenges associated with accomplishing our mission is required.
  Legislative/policy and mental health, knowledge are critical disciplines required in virtually every aspect of wounded warrior care and support.  This RFI allows potential contractors to submit a non-binding statement of interest and documentation demonstrating their corporate capabilities and suggestions that will allow the Government to refine its potential course of action. The RFI effort is intended to assess industry service capabilities and solicit feedback for acquisition planning purposes.  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990.  

BACKGROUND: The WWR requires program management and analytical services covering a broad knowledge of current health care business practices and an extensive understanding of the Marine Corps and Navys health services programs, war fighting operating environment and Joint health services operations.

2. Legislative/Policy Analytical Support: This support entails effective and direct communication with the CO of the WWR and his staff and agencies that directly and indirectly affect legislative matters as they relate to the wounded, ill, and injured.  The Legislative/Policy Analytical support will be expected to research, provide advice, plan, organize, and coordinate with agencies on issues involving legislative policies and issues.  The analyst will work closely with the CO and his staff to establish legislative priorities.
  
3. Program Analysis Support: This support entails frequent and direct contact and communication with the Commanding Officer (CO) of the WWR and his staff.  This support will be expected to provide advice, plan, conduct analysis/assessments, and organize material and information that pertains to events that affect the treatment and care for the wounded, ill, and injured.
  These positions will require review of existing policy, regulations, and procedures, in addition to recommending revisions/modification to existing policy and procedures as they relate to combat and non-combat casualties and their family members.  Program Analysts shall coordinate performance with the appointed Contracting Officers Representative (COR).

No other known capabilities or sources were identified that could meet the requirement of the proposed effort, as the MEMS and Nanotechnology Exchange is the only functioning entity of its kind.</p>

  Also provide any supporting information such as commercial literature, catalogues, manuals, etc.  The response should also include all relevant business information including ROM costs.  

The Government may choose to visit, or host a visit from, any potential sources following the initial response.  This Request for Information (RFI) in no way implies either implicitly or explicitly that respondents will be compensated in any way by the Government for information or materials provided.  

At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.  This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract in connection with this announcement.
 The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.

The contractor shall provide an ABS classed, operational diver lock-in/lock-out dry submersible test platform, capable of demonstrating cited attributes under controlled operating conditions: (1) capable of locking out at least six divers in a single lock-in/lock-out cycle; (2) capable of a sustained, two- hour submerged speed of five knots or greater; (3) capable of transiting at least 10 nautical miles at five knots on a single battery charge; (4) capable of conducting three short duration tests, three or more hours per test per week, and one long duration test, six or more hours per test per week; (5) capable of integration with a surface host to conduct surface ship launches and recoveries; and (6) small enough to integrate with, insert into, and withdraw from a modified Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) simulator. The contractor shall design, install, integrate, support, test, and maintain temporary SOF Modifications and Risk Mitigation Modifications utilizing GFE to permit the government to more accurately evaluate the impact of GFE on capabilities of submersibles of this size. Upon completion of the study, the contractor shall be responsible for all associated demilitarization to return the DCS UOES test platform to its original state to include delivery to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The period of the study shall be one 12-month base year plus two 12-month optional periods, not to exceed 36 months. Based on market survey results, Submergence Group's S301 is the only known and available submersible meeting the Government's test profiles for diver lock-in/lock-out sustained submerged speeds, transiting distance, DDS integration pursuant to ABS classification. These requirements are paramount and cannot be waived. Submergence Group is the original manufacturer of the S301 and has working knowledge of sustaining ABS classification. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal no later than five days of the posting that shall be considered by the agency. The Government intends to award a combination Firm-Fixed Price, and Cost-Plus-Type contract for performance to begin on or about 18 March 2011.

I. Background Information for the Event:

The changing dynamic for Veterans in the 21st century mandates that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) accomplish its myriad of missions more effectively and efficiently.  Delivering the right services at the right time to this growing and ever changing population of Veterans will require: cutting-edge information technology, innovative and improved acquisition processes, a far-reaching transformation of the VA workforce, and end-to-end innovations in management.

VA recognizes that our supplier community is a critical component to our success in meeting the challenges of supporting Veterans in the 21st century.  The VA has embarked on a transformation of the end-to-end acquisition process that will capitalize on this industry expertise as an effort to improve our acquisition process as a whole. 

During the last year, VA collected feedback from the supplier community and from internal VA Program Offices about what is and what is not working with VA's acquisition and procurement processes.  During this Webinar, VA will report summary findings from our feedback collection efforts and address what we have done, are doing and will continue to do in the future to address this feedback.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database;

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Electro Scientific Industries (ESI) to purchase a high speed laser with laser pulse frequencies up to 20 KHz that will be used to upgrade the existing Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system in the FHWA's Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC) Hydraulics Laboratory. The current PIV system includes a laser and 2 cameras and has a pulse frequency of only 15 KHz. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The high pulse repetition rate of 20 KHz is needed to study and measure the macro vortex structures around bridge piers and to measure the high frequency pressure fluctuations which are responsible for the sediment pick-up. The market search focused on acquiring a PIV laser system that is compatible with old system and will not require new control logic software that has to be programmed. An extensive laser to camera software logic was programmed to operate the current PIV system. The software development took several years and was optimized for the existing laser in the laboratory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The old laser was purchased from New Wave Research in 2002, which was the starting point for our market search; however, the vendor was sold to ESI. ESI has continued to produce lasers that are compatible with the current system. It will be very difficult and expensive for the government to reprogram the laser to camera control logic software if a non compatible laser has to be purchased. Therefore ESI is the only source who can provide the high pulse frequency laser.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is February 23, 2011.</span></p>

<p><br />Introduction <br />Section 508 of the amended Rehabilitation Act ("Section 508") was enacted to eliminate barriers that might interfere with the ability of individuals with disabilities to fully access Web-delivered information and fully utilize Web-based tools and services. Section 508 requirements apply to Web sites, including all forms of information and posted content, as well as any associated applications including Web or media. <br />This interim acquisition policy provides language applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use - to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. The project officer (also known as the contracting officer's technical representative) must ensure that communications products produced or delivered by contractors or consultants meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards and are suitable for posting to an HHS Web site. <br />Discussion and Analysis <br />This policy applies to: <br />1. HHS Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions (OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs) and to their contractors and consultants that produce new reports, brochures, and other text or graphical communications products, or produce new multimedia products, such as videotapes and Webcasts, or provide computer based training materials or products. <br />2. HHS OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs and to their contractors and consultants that provide new Web-based product support documentation to end-users.</p>
<p>This interim acquisition guidance does not apply to those systems covered by the specific Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) guidance (dated January 16, 2008) for the acquisition of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) (including Web-based applications, software packages deployed through the Web and script-based interactive sites). <br />This interim acquisition guidance is effective upon issuance for all new acquisitions. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 2</p>
<p>Responsibilities <br />The Assistant Secretary for Resources and Technology (ASRT) shall: <br />Provide policy and procedural support with respect to establishing, implementing, operating and maintaining Web sites or producing communication products and services. <br />The Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA) shall: <br />Propose Section 508-compliant performance standards, provide guidance for their implementation, and ensure that HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web sites are in compliance with Section 508. Guidance and training is available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/policies/index.html#508. <br />Develop training and technical assistance materials to support OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs in the use of this guidance. <br />Appoint a representative to the HHS Section 508 Program Team to ensure alignment with ongoing Departmental Section 508 activities. <br />The Director of the Office on Disabilities (OD) shall: <br />Approve and interpret Section 508-compliant performance standards. <br />Disseminate updated guidance and policy interpretations through http://508.hhs.gov/. <br />Provide technical support to OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs in determining the application of Section 508. <br />Share best practices through the Section 508 Program Team. <br />Review lessons learned and coordinate with ASPA necessary updates to Section 508 guidance. <br />The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Management and Policy (DASAMP) shall: <br />Ensure the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) is modified to incorporate the interim Section 508 guidance provided in this document and ensure that it enhances and supports existing Section 508 guidance. <br />OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs shall: <br />Ensure that HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web sites are in compliance with Section 508. <br />Ensure that the staff receives training and technical assistance regarding Section 508.US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 3 <br />Interim Acquisition Guidance <br />For new actions, while developing or amending a SOW or PWS in accordance with HHSAR 307.7106 (renumbered HHSAR 307.7108) and FAR 37.602, project officers must address communications products and services in the HHS Acquisition Plan. In addition to the acquisition planning requirements under HHSAR Part 307, project officers must address Section 508 compliance requirements for documents generated for and by HHS that require a contractor or consultant to produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. <br />For those acquisitions of communications products and services not requiring an Acquisition Plan, the Project Officer must include all documentation pursuant to HHSAR 307.7101(c). The assigned project officer (contracting officer's technical representative) will ensure communication products are provided to the end-users in a Section 508- compliant format. <br />The project officer must list the applicable provisions of the Access Board Final (36 CFR Part 1194) in the SOW/PWS - e.g., "36 CFR 1194(a)-(j)". Most Web-based text and communication will need to meet 36 CFR Part 1194.22, "Web-Based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications". Additionally, 36 CFR Part 1194.41, "Information, Documentation and Support," and 36 CFR Part 1194.24 "Video and Multimedia Products" are of particular importance with regard to all written, graphical or broadcast, video materials or products produced for HHS (to include training). 36 CFR Part 1194.41 outlines the requirements supporting services for products accommodating the communication needs of end-users with disabilities. Contact your OPDIV/STAFFDIV Section 508 Coordinator for additional assistance in determining the applicable provisions. <br />The Project Officer (the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative), in consultation with ASPA/Web Communications Division, will make a Section 508-compliance determination prior to posting to a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. <br />The project officer shall include the attached "Section C.A. Section 508" language in Statements of Work (SOWs) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for communication products and services that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 4 <br />C.A. Section 508 <br />This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. <br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. <br />There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board's Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board's standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). <br />Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material. <br />1 Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 5 <br />The following Section 508 provisions apply to the content or communications material identified in this SOW or PWS: <br />[Project Officer must list the applicable provisions of the Access Board Final Rule (36 CFR Part 1194) - e.g., "36 CFR 1194.21(a)-(j)"] <br />References: <br />HHS Policy for Section 508 Electronic and Information Technology (E&amp;IT) (January 2005): http://www.hhs.gov/od/Final_Section_508_Policy.html <br />HHS Section 508 Web site: http://508.hhs.gov/ <br />HHS ASPA Web Communications Division Web site: <br />http://www.hhs.gov/web/policies/index.html <br />US General Services Administration (GSA) Section 508 Web site: http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm</p>

The Contractor shall follow the applicable verification requirements at (b)(1) or (b)(2) respectively, except that any requirement for verification of new employees applies only to new employees assigned to the contract. <br />(4) Option to verify employment eligibility of all employees. The Contractor may elect to verify all existing employees hired after November 6, 1986, rather than just those employees assigned to the contract. The Contractor shall initiate verification for each existing employee working in the United States who was hired after November 6, 1986, within 180 calendar days of- <br />(i) Enrollment in the E-Verify program; or <br />(ii) Notification to E-Verify Operations of the Contractor's decision to exercise this option, using the contact information provided in the E-Verify program Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). <br />(5) The Contractor shall comply, for the period of performance of this contract, with the requirements of the E-Verify program MOU. <br />(i) The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or the Social Security Administration (SSA) may terminate the Contractor's MOU and deny access to the E-Verify system in accordance with the terms of the MOU.

<p>Introduction <br />Section 508 of the amended Rehabilitation Act ("Section 508") was enacted to eliminate barriers that might interfere with the ability of individuals with disabilities to fully access Web-delivered information and fully utilize Web-based tools and services. Section 508 requirements apply to Web sites, including all forms of information and posted content, as well as any associated applications including Web or media. <br />This interim acquisition policy provides language applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use - to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. The project officer (also known as the contracting officer's technical representative) must ensure that communications products produced or delivered by contractors or consultants meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards and are suitable for posting to an HHS Web site. <br />Discussion and Analysis <br />This policy applies to: <br />1. HHS Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions (OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs) and to their contractors and consultants that produce new reports, brochures, and other text or graphical communications products, or produce new multimedia products, such as videotapes and Webcasts, or provide computer based training materials or products. <br />2. HHS OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs and to their contractors and consultants that provide new Web-based product support documentation to end-users.</p>
<p>This interim acquisition guidance does not apply to those systems covered by the specific Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) guidance (dated January 16, 2008) for the acquisition of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) (including Web-based applications, software packages deployed through the Web and script-based interactive sites). <br />This interim acquisition guidance is effective upon issuance for all new acquisitions. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 2 <br />Responsibilities <br />The Assistant Secretary for Resources and Technology (ASRT) shall: <br />Provide policy and procedural support with respect to establishing, implementing, operating and maintaining Web sites or producing communication products and services. <br />The Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA) shall: <br />Propose Section 508-compliant performance standards, provide guidance for their implementation, and ensure that HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web sites are in compliance with Section 508. Guidance and training is available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/policies/index.html#508. <br />Develop training and technical assistance materials to support OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs in the use of this guidance. <br />Appoint a representative to the HHS Section 508 Program Team to ensure alignment with ongoing Departmental Section 508 activities. <br />The Director of the Office on Disabilities (OD) shall: <br />Approve and interpret Section 508-compliant performance standards. <br />Disseminate updated guidance and policy interpretations through http://508.hhs.gov/. <br />Provide technical support to OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs in determining the application of Section 508. <br />Share best practices through the Section 508 Program Team. <br />Review lessons learned and coordinate with ASPA necessary updates to Section 508 guidance. <br />The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Management and Policy (DASAMP) shall: <br />Ensure the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR) is modified to incorporate the interim Section 508 guidance provided in this document and ensure that it enhances and supports existing Section 508 guidance. <br />OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs shall: <br />Ensure that HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web sites are in compliance with Section 508. <br />Ensure that the staff receives training and technical assistance regarding Section 508.US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 3 <br />Interim Acquisition Guidance <br />For new actions, while developing or amending a SOW or PWS in accordance with HHSAR 307.7106 (renumbered HHSAR 307.7108) and FAR 37.602, project officers must address communications products and services in the HHS Acquisition Plan. In addition to the acquisition planning requirements under HHSAR Part 307, project officers must address Section 508 compliance requirements for documents generated for and by HHS that require a contractor or consultant to produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. <br />For those acquisitions of communications products and services not requiring an Acquisition Plan, the Project Officer must include all documentation pursuant to HHSAR 307.7101(c). The assigned project officer (contracting officer's technical representative) will ensure communication products are provided to the end-users in a Section 508- compliant format. <br />The project officer must list the applicable provisions of the Access Board Final (36 CFR Part 1194) in the SOW/PWS - e.g., "36 CFR 1194(a)-(j)". Most Web-based text and communication will need to meet 36 CFR Part 1194.22, "Web-Based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications". Additionally, 36 CFR Part 1194.41, "Information, Documentation and Support," and 36 CFR Part 1194.24 "Video and Multimedia Products" are of particular importance with regard to all written, graphical or broadcast, video materials or products produced for HHS (to include training). 36 CFR Part 1194.41 outlines the requirements supporting services for products accommodating the communication needs of end-users with disabilities. Contact your OPDIV/STAFFDIV Section 508 Coordinator for additional assistance in determining the applicable provisions. <br />The Project Officer (the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative), in consultation with ASPA/Web Communications Division, will make a Section 508-compliance determination prior to posting to a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. <br />The project officer shall include the attached "Section C.A. Section 508" language in Statements of Work (SOWs) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for communication products and services that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 4 <br />C.A. Section 508 <br />This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. <br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. <br />There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board's Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board's standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). <br />Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material. <br />1 Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract. US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Acquisition of Communications Products Interim Acquisition Guidance 5 <br />The following Section 508 provisions apply to the content or communications material identified in this SOW or PWS: <br />[Project Officer must list the applicable provisions of the Access Board Final Rule (36 CFR Part 1194) - e.g., "36 CFR 1194.21(a)-(j)"] <br />References: <br />HHS Policy for Section 508 Electronic and Information Technology (E&amp;IT) (January 2005): http://www.hhs.gov/od/Final_Section_508_Policy.html <br />HHS Section 508 Web site: http://508.hhs.gov/ <br />HHS ASPA Web Communications Division Web site: <br />http://www.hhs.gov/web/policies/index.html <br />US General Services Administration (GSA) Section 508 Web site: http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm</p>

The AKTAFPLC is proposed as a sole source purchase on the basis that NIAID laboratories already own 6 similar FPLC machines, which are shared with post-docs whose users have knowledge on how to use equipment and the software package that is included with the system. The systems are in use 100% of the time imposing constraints with experiments being delayed because of not enough systems to handle all experiments. This is to ensure the compatibility of experimental data. The lab must have the ability to purify biomolecules from complex starting materials derived from cell lysates, tissue homogenates, recombinant protein expression systems and other sources. This system is required to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity. Delivery is to be made no more than 45 days after receipt of order to Bethesda, Maryland, 20892. Award will be based on meeting the following: 1) salient characteristics, 2) price, 3) warranty, and 4) delivery. The FOB point shall be Destination. This will be a firm-fixed price contract.

<p>SUMMARY: The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, Texas, is seeking a Contractor to furnish all labor, equipment, materials, and incidentals required for tree planting of approximately 366.5 acres consisting of five (5) sites for the NRCS Texas Wetland Reserve Program (WRP). All work shall be done in accordance with the tree/shrub establishment Statement of Work, the Tree Planting Plan and Tree Planting Specifications.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Restoration projects on these five (5) sites include the planting of hardwood seedlings. <br /><br />SCOPE OF WORK: <br />1. Pre-Planting Conference: A pre-planting conference will be held between the contractor, owner (or his agent) and the NRCS to discuss planting operation. Planting will not begin before this the Pre-Planting Conference.</p>
<p>2. Tree Planting: Hardwood seedlings will be hand planted or machine planted on a 10' X 10' spacing (436 trees per acre) on approximately 366.5 acres.

In addition, a separate mix will be used for the strips planted around water impoundments. In these strips at least two species from the list in the Tree Planting Specification will be used. <br /><br />4. Species Substitution: If a substitution is necessary due to the unavailability of a species from the nursery, low counts in the bags, modifications of the planting plan due to unforeseen conditions, etc., a species will be selected that has an equal or greater tolerance to wetness than the originally selected one. Contractor must acquire approval from the NRCS for any species substitution.</p>
<p>5. Spacing and Planting Rate: Hardwood will be planted on a 10' X 10' spacing (436 trees per acre). The number of satisfactory planted seedlings must fall within 15% of this planting rate or 370 seedlings per acre. Areas along the shores of impoundments and natural slough and wet depressions will be planted with the proper species and to the extend that the water depth will allow. In these areas, spacing will be increase to 15' X 15'. <br /><br />6. Species Mixes: Mixes will be achieved through "bag-mixes" and/or matching the species to the site. <br />Unless otherwise specified in the Tree Planting Plan, row or block plantings of single mixes will be avoided.

Prune by pulling the laterals down along the tap root or cut to its (the tap's root's) length. Pruning will done only with shears or a sharp knife. All care must be taken to prevent tearing of roots. <br />b. Tops: Tops may be pruned to a minimum height of 16".</p>
<p>10. Planting Methods: Seedlings will be hand planted or machine planted. Seedlings will be planted with the root collar slightly below the soil surface. Roots will be not be balled, twisted or planted in a "J" or "U" shaped manner. Steps needed to ensure the compacting of the soil around the seedling, leaving no air pockets in the planting slit, will be taken. When optimum site and soil moisture and/or temperature conditions are not available, consult with the NRCS before planting.</p>
<p>11. Quality Control: The Control will be ultimately responsible for quality assurance. Quality control will be explained during the Pre-Planting Conference. In addition, NRCS representatives will be available during the first day of planting and will occasionally visit the site during planting. They will also be available for consultation, but they will not serve as daily inspectors. It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide daty-to-day oversight of the planting crews.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ is looking to procure the following items for temperature transducers and related hardware. Also being procured are a variety of different thermocouple transducers, the cabling, and attachment devices for the thermocouples. This equipment will be used to measure a multitude of temperatures, and is part of the signal flow for the temperature measurement. Specifically, this equipment will be used to support the F-35 (JSF) compatibility with the current Jet Blast Deflector (JBD).

What does the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) mean when it      refers to a &ldquo;socialist market economy,&rdquo; or to &ldquo;capitalism with Chinese      characteristics?&rdquo; What are the prospects for China&rsquo;s emergence as a      &ldquo;market economy&rdquo; as commonly understood in relation to WTO accession? And,      how is the PRC&rsquo;s practice of state capitalism likely to impact the United      States in the future?</span></li>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br /><br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).<br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.50 per hour or $140.00 per week or $606.67 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, inthose instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at <a href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/">http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/</a> or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>
<p>Equiv. Rates for Federal Hires<br />This Statement is for Information Only:<br /><br />It is not a Wage Determination<br /><br />Employee Class Monetary Wage -- Fringe Benefits<br />Window Cleaner WG-05/1 ea $16.16/hr<br />Laborer WG-03/1 ea $14.28/hr</p>
<p>2. The SF schedule states 455,776 SF of window glass. Cleaning both sides would then make the total SF quantity of window glass to clean be 911,552 SF. Is this correct that there is 455,776 SF of window and that 911,552 SF of glass surface will be cleaned? <br /><br />Answer: No, the 455,776 SF includes both the interior and exterior of the windows.<br /><br />3. Is it acceptable to electronically submit our proposal, and acceptable to submit on our Company letterhead, since there is no form, such as a SF1449 provided?<br /><br />Answer: Yes, it is acceptable to electronically submit your proposal and it is acceptable to submit your proposal on Company letterhead.<br /><br />4. The original notice states a (10) month period of performance and amendments state a (7) month period, our Firm will plan on and schedule manpower to complete in the (7) month time period.<br /><br />Answer: Yes, the Ktr will have seven months to complete the requirement. <br /><br />5. Our firm has AT Level 1 training. Will all employees be required to have at minimum the AT Level 1? Additionally, will there be a requirement for Secret or Top Secret for any employees?<br /><br />Answer: No, employees will not be required to have AT Level 1 training.<br />No, there will not be a requirement for Secret or Top Secret for any of the Ktr's employees.<br /><br />6. I do not understand the lift estimate. The two day per bldg guess is a reach, I believe. How are we supposed to calculate this or is the Government going to allot a certain amount for this? For example, some companies may only use it for the 3rd floor, while others will <br /><br />Answer: It is the Ktr's responsibility to determine what equipment they will need and how long they will need it for. This will be a firm-fixed price contract; adjustments will not be made if a Ktr does not include everything necessary to accomplish the work in their price.<br /><br />7. What about liability issues?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.50 per hour or $140.00 per week or $606.67 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<DESC>This amends the previously issued announcement for Solicitation No. N889510061 (Combined Synopsis/Solicitation).
The following changes are made to the requirement:
1.  Changes to the cameras specified in the previous amendment.  In the previous amendment (Amendment #2), the 2 fixed cameras were changed to mini HD PTZ.  However, the corresponding changes to the Contract Price Schedule were inadvertently overlooked.  As such, the Contract Price Schedule has been revised.  The revised CPS entitled, "Rev Contract Price Schedule" can be obtained by contacting the Contracting Officer, Joelle Mascarenas at Joelle_Mascarenas@nps.gov if you are not already on the bidder's list.
2.  Questions and Answers to Questions Received Thru 2/4/2011.
Q4:  Please confirm work hours and any restrictions such as parking, special passes, etc.A4:  The park is open from 7:00 am-5:00 pm daily.  Maintenance personnel arrive at 5:30 am and can open any doors that contractors may need access to.  The contractor's general work hours should primarily be between 8:00 am-5:00 pm, Monday-Friday.  There is a delivery road where equipment can be dropped off, but contractor parking will be in the main parking lots.  If a delivery/service vehicle is needed to complete work, law enforcement personnel will direct them to a location in which to park in proximity to the job site.  All workers must park in the general parking lot where visitors park and wak in to the job site.  The delivery access road has a security checkpoint where the driver will be identified and logged in upon entry.  Workers walking in will go through a pedestrian security checkpoint.  If they are carrying bags, tools, or equipment, these items will be searched, tagged and logged in.
Q5:  Could you please provide as-builts for the telecommunications/signal and/or security conduit layout?  If the drawings are too large to be sent out, is it possible to schedule a time to review them?A5:  As-built drawings are not available at this time.  Instead, Construction Drawings (14 pages total) are provided as attachments to this amended annoucement in response to this question.  The drawings can be obtained by contacting the Contracting Officer, Joelle Mascarenas at Joelle_Mascarenas@nps.gov if you are not already on the bidder's list.
Q6:  Do you want the Project Management cost to be distributed within the equipment or included in the labor category?A6:  Project Mangement costs should be spread across the project in whatever way the contractor feels is appropriate to the work,  but should not be billed as an upfront cost.
Q7:  Is the price proposal to be submitted separately from the technical proposal?A7:  Yes, and the prices proposed must be shown on the Contract Price Schedule, as well as the SF-1449 form.
Q8:  Please confirm the number of copies is one plus the original.A8:  Yes, please submit an original and one copy.
Q9:  Would it be possible to schedule another walk through of the site?A9:  There are no more formal site visits scheduled.  However, you may visit the site on your own as a visitor during normal business hours.  It is sugested that you notify Dave Stransky at 422-3321 of the date/time of your visit in case you get approached by security.
Q10:   Please clarify "existing security panel" from the above statement [reference the section beginning... Integration of keyless entry system on 13 existing strike doors (Bldgs. D & F).

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). This solicitation document and all incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-49.  This is a total small business set-aside and only offers from small businesses shall be considered.  The relevant NAICS code is 339116 with small business size standard of 500 employees.  Proposals are due on February 10, 2011 at 5 p.m. Eastern Time.  Proposals, as well as any questions or requests for clarifications, should be submitted to Eric Sullivan, Contracting Officer at the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center, by email (eric.sullivan2@va.gov) or facsimile (561-422-6507).

Base period:  		March 1, 2011 - February 29, 2012 
Option period 1: 		March 1, 2012 - February 28, 2013 
Option period 2:		March 1, 2013 - February 28, 2014 
Option period 3:		March 1, 2014 - February 28, 2015

INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) at Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is responsible for providing comprehensive logistic support to approximately 100 foreign partners. Eligible countries own and operate over 11,000 aging aircraft of various configurations and associated support equipment of U.S. origin. This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 15.403). Contractor will be responsible for meeting requirements in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) (DOD 5105.38-M), and Air Force Manual 23-110, International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The PROS contract is a Tri-Se! rvice program designed to acquire procurement services to meet the needs of our FMS Air Force, Navy and Army partners. North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services. The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners. Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts. The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC. This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots. Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc) The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support. These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options. The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars. This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government. Capabilities Package: All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services. Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009. The PROS Program team will hold an industry day at the Hilton, Garden Inn, 3250 Pentagon Park Boulevard, Beavercreek OH 45431 on Thursday 17 Dec 2009 from 09:00 till 15:00. We will present a brief overview of the PROS III program followed by open questions. Points of Contact: The Contracting Officer for the PROS program is William T. Smith at William.smith4@wpafb.af.mil. All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted in writing to the PCO for distribution to the acquisition team. Do not provide proprietary information in your questions to the contracting officer since all questions and answers will be shared amongst all interested parties.

<DESC>The U.S. Army PEO-EIS Technology Applications Office is requesting information from responsible sources and commercial agencies to address possible near-term development and acquisition initiatives that will deliver communications capabilities for airborne, ground, and maritime platforms using an X-Band SATCOM Communications on the Move (XCOTM) system.<BR><BR>The XCOTM will provide the necessary connectivity from airborne, ground, and maritime internal communications systems to ground-based DoD/Government/Commercial communications systems. XCOTM will support voice, data, and video services that enable military forces to collaborate and oversee the full range of military operations. <BR><BR>The XCOTM is expected to operate on commercial X-Band satellite constellations (e.g. XTAR, Paradigm, etc.) as well as the Government's Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) constellation.  As a result, XCOTM terminal must be designed to meet commercial and WGS terminal certification requirements.<BR><BR>Based on the Government's initial analysis, the target antenna size for the XCOTM is approximately 13" in diameter.  A center-fed, circular, parabolic antenna is anticipated, but alternative solutions will be considered.  Since off-axis spectral density is a key consideration, antenna patterns will be needed for analysis.  <BR><BR>A minimum Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) of 42dBW is required.  A minimum receive G/T is not specified, but the Government is interested in knowing the expected G/T of the XCOTM system, especially when under the anticipated radome.<BR><BR>A potential XCOTM acquisition is expected to include all communications equipment needed on board the aircraft, ground vehicle, or maritime vessel, including terminal, waveguide, cabling, amplifiers and other RF equipment, radomes, antenna control systems, software, and installation and integration (I&I) hardware.  While slight variations are expected in the three variants, the majority of the antenna, RF, and mechanical components are expected to be common.  <BR><BR>At a minimum, vendor is expected to show that XCOTM system will comply with the following size and weight constraints: <BR> 	Mounting base plate: width: 9.55" and length: 14.21"  <BR> 	At the fore end of the base plate, available width is 9.6" and height is 10.44"<BR> 	At the mid-point of the base plate, available width is 13.16" and height is 13.13" <BR> 	At the aft end of the base plate, the available width is 11.66" and height is 13.7"<BR> 	Maximum weight is 50 lbs.<BR> 	Additional information is available upon request<BR><BR>The XCOTM system will interface a Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) L-Band satellite modem and necessary data networking equipment including encryption devices.  The XCOTM systems will properly upconvert, downconvert, and amplify the L-Band (950-2150 MHz) signal to/from X-Band (TX: 7900-8400 MHz, RX: 7250-7750 MHz).  The XCOTM system must be modem-agnostic (i.e. able to connect to any commercial or Government L-Band modem and not be reliant on the modem to acquire or track the satellite).  XCOTM will have the ability to transmit using either Right Hand Circular Polarization (RHCP) or Left Hand Circular Polarization (LHCP) while receiving on the opposite polarization.<BR><BR>The XCOTM system will have the ability to determine its own physical location (in three-dimensional space), heading, and speed independently from any input from the platform on which it is installed. XCOTM must be able to acquire and track a given satellite when stationary and while moving at speeds between 1 knot (1.51MPH) and 400 knots (460MPH).  If satellite acquisition/tracking is lost during operations due to blockage, power loss, or other events, XCOTM must be able to automatically reacquire the satellite without operator intervention at these same speeds within two minutes of regaining a clear view to the satellite. <BR><BR>Potential XCOTM solutions that are cost effective, mature, and available in a short timeframe (i.e., ready to test in the first half of 2011) are desired. <BR>While the initial capability is expected in X-Band, the Government is interested in seeing a roadmap to eventual operations using Ka-Band spectrum with as little change in components as possible.<BR><BR>Companies having capabilities relevant to XCOTM are requested to provide information on systems and subsystems that could potentially support the XCOTM solution. Specific information should include: (1) short description of the capability; (2) anticipated EIRP, G/T, and pointing accuracy (3) block diagram of components; (4) required Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP); (5) status of capability, i.e., in development, operational; (6) technology readiness level (TRL) using the definitions in the July 2009 DoD Technology Readiness Assessment Handbook, with rationale; (7) source of capability; (8) current military and/or commercial users; (9) availability (when deliveries are projected); (10) rough order of magnitude (ROM) remaining development costs and schedule; (11) identification of proprietary components, interfaces, and manufacturing techniques; and (12) risks to implementation.<BR><BR>The Capability package must be clear, concise, complete and shall also include (in additional to the technical aspects above), at a minimum; 1) Identify their organization's name, address, telephone number, and point of contact (also with title, phone, fax, and email) on packaging and title pages (The organization name should appear clearly on every page of your submittal and proprietary information must also be clearly marked.); 2) Organization Size/ownership of business, i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), Disabled-Veteran, Veteran, Women-owned Business, and Hub-zone; 3) Number of years in business; 4) Cage Code, DUNS# and Tax ID# (TIN#); 5) Company profile: number of employees, annual sales history, locations and if CCR registered.; 6) Identify if you are a GSA Schedule holders; 7) Affiliate contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); 8) Experience and familiarity with providing the requested equipment; and 9) Contract references in the past five (5) years relevant to the requirement to include: contract number, agency supported, whether or not you were the prime or subcontractor, period of performance, original contract value, final or current contract value, technical monitor and phone/fax number, POC with current phone/fax number, and a brief description of the effort.  In addition, all responses should be unclassified and marked appropriately to ensure consideration of operational sensitivities (e.g., STINFO). <BR><BR>The information received WILL NOT obligate the Government in any manner nor will the Government reimburse companies for any costs associated with submittal of this RFI. This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or a Request for Proposals, nor should it be considered as a commitment on the part of the Government. Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Government on a non-attribution basis for XCOTM program planning and acquisition strategy development.

Yes<BR>b)Does GPS need to use SASM or is commercial GPS acceptable? Commercial is acceptable.<BR>5)Testing - Answer: Testing is not in the scope of the RFI<BR>a)What type and duration of testing would be expected to occur in 2011?<BR>b)What TRL level should the test prototype be at?<BR>c)Will WGS or Commercial Sat's be used for the initial test target?<BR>d)What level of GFE support can be expected during testing?<BR>6)ROM Assumptions - Answer: The RFI defines the information Government expects to see in the response.  <BR>a)What is the expected period of performance, (calendar and total weeks/months/years) for the test program? <BR>b)What TRL will be the target at completion of development testing?<BR>c)Are there target delivery quantities and production rates to be used for manufacturing and risk calculations?<BR>7)Operations <BR>a)What are the maximum roll and pitch angles the platform will see?  Spec not yet defined<BR>b)What is the highest and lowest latitude that the system will be deployed at? +/- 65 degrees<BR>c)What is the minimum look angle that the antenna should perform at? Spec not yet defined<BR>d)Is there a specification or requirement detailing the platform movement/slew rates and accelerations?  Spec not yet defined but current capability would be interesting to learn.<BR>e)Are there any line of sight transmission obstructions? Spec not yet defined<BR>8)Question: Is the targeted aeronautical product for a tail pod or hatch mount configuration?<BR>Answer:  Could be both Hatch and Pod<BR>9)Question: What is the anticipated field of view and is there a minimum elevation requirement and if so what is the minimum Tx Gain and G/T? <BR>ANSWER: NO MINIMUM ELEVATION REQUIREMENT... WE ANTICIPATE A PARABOLIC SOLUTION WHICH IS AN ADVANTAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE ELEVATION QUESTION COMPATRED TO TODAYS TECHNOLOGY IN PHASED ARRAYS..FOR MARITIME AMND AIRBORNE APPS WE MAY SEE LESS THAN 0 DEGREE LOOK ANGLE REQUIRMENTS.. irt  G ON T AND EIRP.... WE PLAN TO USE THIS ANTENNA ON COMMERCIAL X BAND AND WGS... WE DID THE CALCS TO ENSURE 13 INCHES WAS THE RIGHT APERTURE FIGURING PSD LIMITS FOR X BAND... TYPICAL XMIT/RCV DATA RATES WE WANT TO ACHIEVE ARE GREAter than 1 mbps full dux with a reasonable top end given the size on an SSPA no larger than 75 watts......<BR>10)Question: What analysis is driving the expectation of a 13" parabolic dish solution?<BR>ANSWER: ARSTRAT provided maximum off-axis EIRP Spectral Density level agreements with adjacent satellite owners.  This off-axis ESD was used to calculate the smallest dish size that would allow for a transmit data rate of 6Mbps, operate in the X-Band frequency range, and not violate the agreements.  For planning purposes, the most restrictive case for off-axis EIRP Spectral Density is -37.00 dBW/Hz at 5.8 .  <BR>11)Question: The RFI seems to indicate the same solution is desired for ground, air, maritime when in fact all three are very different environments with dramatically different requirements particularly on the positioners.  Can you further elaborate for which vehicles the customer is interested?  Paved vs Churchville B ground mobile?  What types of maritime vessels and sea state conditions under which the system needs to operate?  Which aircraft are of interest?  What might be fine for a low flying slow King Air would not be fine for a high flying jet like a C-17 e.g.  And without rotor blockage mitigation (modem, waveform and land earth station), rotorcraft are probably not an option at above L band.<BR>ANSWER:  The government is initially interested in learning about the vendor's capability to provide an antenna system to be used on a fixed-wing aircraft within an existing radome.  Vendors do not need to plan on rotor blockage.  The key factor, initially, is the ability to fit within the size constraint of the existing radome.  The Government understands that different positioners may be needed for ground vehicular and/or maritime use and that may necessitate a larger and/or heavier solution for these platforms.  The Government would prefer to re-use as many components as possible (e.g. reflector, RF components, filters, etc.).<BR>12)Question: Can you elaborate on the minimum requirement of complying with the baseplate requirement?  I am not understanding the limitations implied.  It would seem that the available height could only support closer to an 8" dish e.g.<BR>ANSWER: The system shall fit within a volume described by a hemisphere with a radius of 6.55" above a cylinder with a radius of 6.55" and height of 6.55".<BR>13)Question: Does the polarization need to be remotely switchable mid-mission, or is the polarization only needing to be pre-mission configurable?<BR>ANSWER: The polarization only needs to be selected/changed pre-mission.  Polarization will not change during mission.<BR><BR>NO MORE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

NON-DISCRIMINATION NOTICE TO U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR CONTRACTORS, SUBCONTRACTORS, AND LESSORS (DEC 1999)Based upon law, Executive Order, or internal policy, the Department of the Interior prohibits discrimination in the workplace, including sexual harassment, based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability, age, or sexual orientation. The Department urges its contractors, subcontractors and lessors to develop and enforce comprehensive anti-discrimination policies for their places of work. 
This notice states that Department's non-discrimination policy and encourages the same from its contractors, subcontractors, and lessors.

H.2	DIG 2010-04	PROHIBITION ON TEXT MESSAGING AND USING ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT SUPPLIED BY THE GOVERNMENT WHILE DRIVING	MARCH 2010
Executive Order 131513, Federal Leadership on Reducing Text Messaging While Driving, was  signed by President Barack Obama on October 1, 2009 (ref.:  http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-24203.pdf).  This Executive Order introduces a Federal Government-wide prohibition on the use of text messaging while driving on official business or while using Government-supplied equipment.

H.3	ET 02-20	AUTHORIZED WORKERS NOTICE TO POTENTIAL BUREAU OF RECLAMATION CONTRACTORS	SEPTEMBER 2002
(a) Definitions.
IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986INA - Immigration and Nationality ActINS - Immigration and Naturalization Service SSA - Social Security AdministrationINS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements ProgramESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
(b) Who is Covered. INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination. These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements. Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S. The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9). Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer. Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site:  http://www.uscis.gov/i-9
(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs. The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees. Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program. If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
	(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
	(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia. The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem. To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.

	(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature. If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature. To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(e) Employee Rights. The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
(f) Compliance Assistance. More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
(g) Penalties/Sanctions. Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions. As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms. They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment. A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) to negotiate/award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Capintec, Inc. for the purchase of a Custom Dual Hot Cell, with a three (3) part horizontal sliding door configuration. 

The reference number NHLBI-PB-(EB)-2011-7-KCC.  

The Laboratory of Molecular Imaging and Nanomedicine (LMIN) is a service lab within the Intramural Research Program (IRP), which conducts research on the development of radio-labeled compounds as novel imaging agents.  The LMIN requires a customized dual, with a three part horizontal sliding door configuration.  The dual hot cells will shield boxes containing radioisotopes, which will limit the radiation exposure.  Specifically, the dual hot cells will be used to house automated radiochemistry synthesizers that require minimal human manipulation.

The sole source determination is based on the unique Capintec design, which is more amenable to the type of work performed by the LMIN staff.  The Capintec hot cells have a unique design, which can be used for automated synthesis and manual synthesis to fit the LMIN research needs for conducting a variety of radiochemical synthesis.  The horizontally design sliding doors will allow for more convenient and rapid access compared to the traditional vertical door configuration.  Additionally, the available laboratory space is limited, and the standard hot cells are too large to fit the allotted lab space.

This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size is 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(EB)-2011-7-KCC may be submitted by mail to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6148, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Kenya Crawford, by fax transmission to (301)480-3345, or by email to crawfordke@mail.nih.gov

This action is under the authority of 41.U.S.C.253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 13.106(b)(2), and HHSAR 306-302-1. Parties responding to this announcement need to do so by 8:30 am Eastern Standard Time on February 15, 2011.

Q2.	Would the Government entertain extending the closing data for this sources sought notice.

A2.	The Government needs to abide by the original closing date.  If vendors wish to supplement their submissions with extra information at a later date, the Government will not turn away any data.

Q3.	Is there a maximum price tag on the system?

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to continue procuring services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean&nbsp;Service (NOS) on a sole source basis from EXA Data &amp; Mapping, Inc. by increasing the ceiling amount of NOAA IDIQ contract AB133C-09-CQ-0025 on the basis of unusual and compelling urgency as authorized by statute.&nbsp;<br /><br />Vendor is providing services to support the maintenance, application, and further development of NOAA's environmental databases that serve as a repository for environmental sediment chemistry, tissue residue chemistry, and sediment toxicity data. These databases have three general applications: 1) to serve as an integral component of NOAA's Watershed Database and Mapping Projects, 2) to support site-specific investigations, including evaluations of risk or injury to NOAA resources, derivation of cleanup goals, and evaluations of remedial alternatives at hazardous waste sites or spills, and 3) to provide the foundation for conducting specialized analyses, such as exploring innovative approaches for the evaluation of sediment chemistry and toxicity data and developing new guidelines for screening sediments in support of risk assessments. <br /><br />This contract has also served as a vehicle for NOAA to rapidly engage the services of environmental-contaminant database experts necessary to respond to the stringent data management requirements of the Nation's largest SONS, facilitating the design and implementation, in extremely short timeframes, of core data intake system enhancements. These initial modifications to NOAA's data handling system have made it possible for NOAA to address the vast quantity of data associated with the DWH spill response. While many required modifications have been addressed, NOAA anticipates that additional development will be necessary as the Assessment and Restoration Division begins to incorporate data from additional sources in the analyses.he government intends to negotiate a revised contract schedule with a 1-year period of performance as&nbsp;limited by the statutory authority used for this justification. <br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after the publication of this notice. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining the availability of capable sources&nbsp;and to determine whether or not&nbsp;the future reprocurement of these services can be done on a competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses to this notice will not substitute for responses to future notices related to this requirement. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.<br /><br />

<DESC><br />Notice Type: Special Notice
<p>Solicitation Number: HSCG23-11-Q-ADD013<br /><br />Synopsis:</p>
<p>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to purchase, on a SOLE-SOURCE basis from Gartner, Incorporated, IAS Advisory Workgroup Services for one advisor plus six workgroup members. The USCG's use of Gartner's IAS Advisory Workgroup services is further explained below. However, any organization (other than Gartner) that believes it is capable of providing an equivalent services at the high level of quality and complexity indispensable to the USCG, shall email a Statement of Qualifications to Kristina.A.Morris@uscg.mil no later than 2:00PM EST on 22 February 2011.</p>
<p>Further Information concerning the USCG's requirement and Gartner's capabilities is provided below.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard Logistics Information Management System (CG-LIMS) Acquisition Project will require a centrally managed, integrated, enterprise-wide logistics information management system to support USCG assets and their associated systems and equipment. This system will serve as the enterprise logistical support tool for aircraft, cutters, boats, C4ISR systems, and shore facilities. The USCG objective is to acquire a logistics system that will leverage industry standards and best practices to increase efficiency, optimize effectiveness, and establish common processes for managing logistics across the enterprise. The ability to maximize operational capabilities and minimize lifecycle costs are fundamental goals. CG-LIMS must be interoperable with legacy USCG and other government agencies' systems. CG-LIMS will be a feeder system to the Coast Guard's core accounting system. CG-LIMS will interface with existing and future USCG systems as they are transformed and modernized. As such, the system will need to be Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) compliant, and be scalable and flexible in meeting existing and future requirements.</p>
<p>Currently, the USCG is reassessing the acquisition strategy behind the CG-LIMS requirement. The USCG requires advisory services at a level of complexity required for CG-LIMS for the implementation of the acquisition strategy that is currently being chartered.</p>
<p>Given the USCG's critical mission and the fundamental role of IT in the success of CG-LIMS, it is important for CG-9334 to have access to extensive technology information and IT analyst expertise to provide guidance upon which to make implementation decisions. The types of issues on which CG-9334 will focus on include advisory support services at a high level of complexity in the following areas:</p>
<p>Enterprise Asset Management and ERP systems<br />Evaluation of EAM/ERP service providers<br />Software Licensing<br />Service Level Agreements<br />Application Delivery<br />Program-Project Management and EVM<br />Methods for Delivering ERP<br />Data Management</p>
<p>Gartner provides a comprehensive set of analysts, research, and tools to meet the USCG requirements at a level of complexity essential to CG-LIMS. The tools are easy to use and have the flexibility to be tailored to the specific requirements of various users. Gartner has unique access to analysts, consultants and resources that offer the breadth of expertise, experience, and level of intricacy required during the implementation of the Coast Guard's acquisition strategy. Gartner offers access to reliable research and insight, proven best practices, and innovative thinking for strategy implementation. Gartner's unique angle and span of experience is required in the implementation phase of the subject project.</p>
<p>The United States Coast Guard is aware of no organization, other than Gartner, Incorporated, that can: (a) provide the services described above; and (b) provide the broad range of expertise which Gartner can make available on very short notice and which is covered within the cost of the package. However, any organization (other than Gartner) which believes that it is capable of providing an equivalent service at the high level of quality and complexity indispensable to CG-9334, shall e-mail a Statement of Qualifications to Kristina.A.Morris@uscg.mil not later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time February 22, 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The justification for other than full and open competition is attached.</p>
