<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice, for a planned acquisition, is to provide revegetation (grass seeding) services at the USAF Academy, CO.  This requirement will be awarded as a BPA with a five (5) year period of performance.  The National Acquisition Industrial Classification Standard Code (NAICS) proposed is 561730, Landscaping Services, and the business size standard is $6,500,000.     

This acquisition will be set-aside 100 percent for HUB Zone.
 
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES:     The requirement includes providing materials, tools, equipment, vehicles and all other items necessary to re-seed areas throughout the Air Force Academy and Farish Memorial park.  

The contractors shall use seed mixes consistent with the requirements provided.  Special seed mixes may need to be developed for unique site conditions such as wetlands and riparian areas.  Soil preparation on disturbed sites shall include tilling, harrowing, or raking.  The contractor shall remove rocks larger than six (6) inches prior to reseeding.  In the disturbed sites, the contractors shall till the soil to a minimum depth of four inches, then harrow or rake to produce firm seedbed for planting.  Sites without suitable surface soils for plant growth shall be covered with three (3) inches of weed-free topsoil that shall be incorporated by disking.  The contractors shall drill seed or broadcast seed depending on the slope of the disturbed site and the size of the area.  Drill seeding is the preferred method for seeding if site conditions are suitable for using rangeland seeding equipment.  The contractor shall use weed-free native hay or weed-free straw, crimped into the soil 3-4 inches; virgin wood fiber hydro mulch with a color dye and manufacturer recommended rate of organic tackifier; or erosion control blankets to control erosion and promote seed germination management and plant establishment.

At least 2 Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with separate contractors will be established. The BPA is a method of fulfilling anticipated repetitive services with more than one contractor where the exact time, quantity and type of service is not currently known. Over time, work will be distributed between BPAs. Offerors will submit price schedules for all possible services of which the lowest priced offers will be incorporated into BPAs. 

Contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and On-Line Representations and Certifications (ORCA). Anticipated posting is scheduled on or about 1 April 2007 utilizing the FedBizOpps.gov single government point-of-entry (GPE) for Federal government procurement opportunities at www.fbo.gov and solicitation documents will not be available by any other means.     
5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005) 

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.

In addition to providing instructional support, the contractor shall provide live fire ranges, waterborne facilities, breacher equipment and supplies, weapons and ammunition.  This training will provide Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) Riverine Force crew members, employed in littoral operations, with skills to support Maritime Interdiction Operations, and to support Marine and Army Expeditionary Forces, maintain and secure river and adjacent areas of operation, as well as, define, own and occupy the water space.  The MIO training will provide NECC personnel with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform small unit tactical movements, convoy operations, radio communications, range safety, handling and preservation of ammunition, Counter-Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) operations, water survival techniques, tactical operations, defensive tactics, interior guard functions, and detainee handling procedures.  This training allows qualified personnel to demonstrate, maintain and qualify on primary and secondary crew-served weapons, while performing basic movement while engaging targets, transitioning from primary to secondary weapon, and live-fire exercises in a controlled environment.  The two class convenings are for five (5) weeks each, with one beginning April 23, 2007 and the second beginning June 11, 2007.

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW), Technical Support Center (TSC) requires contractor support for analytical laboratory services in conjunction with implementation of the second cycle of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation (UCMR2). The EPA has the responsibility to investigate chemical, radiological and microbiological contaminant occurrence in order to characterize drinking water threats. While EPA relies on independent research efforts, it also is heavily engaged in conducting drinking water occurrence studies to obtain new data. The largest of these studies is the monitoring program mandated by the UCMR. The UCMR is a 5-year cyclic monitoring program, which allows OGWDW to evaluate contaminant occurrence in finished drinking water. The anticipated strategy is to select the key contaminants identified as occurrence priorities, which when combined with health effects data and available drinking water treatment technologies, enable EPA to establish National Primary Drinking Water Standards and maximize the protection of public health.  As a means to reduce the UCMR compliance burden on small public water systems (those serving less than 10,000 individuals), EPA selected a representative sample of 480 small systems that must comply with the UCMR monitoring requirements for List 2 contaminants.  This procurement will specifically serve as the means for conducting these sample analyses relative to EPA Laboratory Approval for the List 2 Screening Survey methods (EPA Methods 521, 525.2 and 535).  In addition, EPA separately selected a representative sample of 800 small systems that must comply with the UCMR monitoring requirements for List 1 contaminants.   This procurement will serve as a means for conducting referee analyses relative to EPA Laboratory Approval for the List 1 Assessment Monitoring methods (EPA Methods 527 and 529).  Successful offerors to PR-CI-07-10363 shall provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment, and facilities to support the tasked analytical services included in the Statement of Work.  Tasks under this solicitation will include:  1)	Conducting laboratory analyses, following all required QC using methods promulgated for UCMR2.  An interested laboratory will need to have EPA Laboratory Approval for both the List 2 Screening Survey methods (EPA Methods 521, 525.2 and 535) and the List 1 Assessment Monitoring methods (EPA Methods 527 and 529). 2)	Providing logistical support by logging, receiving, confirming appropriate preservation, and storing field samples received at their laboratory in support of this contract. 3)	Reporting results in a timely manner using an EPA specified electronic format. 4)	Preparing monthly reports identifying any problems encountered as well as the status of work completed and on-going analyses. Under an existing contract vehicle, EPA will coordinate the preparation of these kits and the collection of these samples.  To reiterate, laboratories will not be responsible for sample shipping costs, unless these shipping costs are the direct result of chronic sample recollections due to gross laboratory negligence or incompetence. To ensure sufficient laboratory capacity, it is anticipated that multiple contracts will be established under this requirement as indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contracts.   It is anticipated that two contracts may be awarded under this solicitation.  The contract will be fixed rate for each Method Analysis.  The anticipated contracts will have an ordering period of five years. Over the five year multiple award ordering period, EPA estimates a sum total (adding all methods individually and multiplying by the number of applicable Public Water Systems and anticipated sampling locations per PWS) of approximately 22,200 sample analyses will be ordered for the List 2 Screening Survey.   The approximate total for the Screening Survey is comprised of an estimated; 11,000 analyses for EPA Method 521; 5,600 analyses for Method 525.2; and, 5,600 analyses for Method 535.  In addition, an estimated 2,000 referee sample analyses may be required for List 1 Assessment Monitoring.  This approximate total for Assessment Monitoring is comprised of an estimated: 1,000 referee analyses for Method 527; and, 1,000 referee analyses for Method 529.  The vast majority of these analyses will be conducted during the three year monitoring period for UCMR2 (extending from January 2008 through December 2010). Firms interested in this requirement need to recognize that it will need to have EPA approval for both List 2 Screening Survey methods (EPA Methods 521, 525.2 and 535) and List 1 Assessment Monitoring methods (EPA Methods 527 and 529).  To attain EPA approval, UCMR2 laboratory application(s) must be complete without unresolved deficiencies and firms must have passed an EPA offered proficiency testing (PT) study for each of the respective methods.   The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and1552.209-72) require an offeror certify that it is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or disclose any potential conflict of interest which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the solicitation. The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after contract award will also be a part of the solicitation. The applicable NAICS code is: 541380 with a size standard of $11 million. The projected start date of the contract is August 1, 2007. The solicitation is expected to be posted to the internet on or about April 7, 2007, as Solicitation Number PR-CI-07-10363 and may be accessed through the EPA?s home page on the World Wide Web (www.epa.gov) or through the direct link URL: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. A draft copy of the Performance Work Statement will be posted to http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd for review. No hard copies of the solicitation shall be provided. It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the EPA website for updates or changes. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>This is a combined presolicitation/solicitation posting.

The MCA Threshold Program is implemented under a Strategic Objective Agreement with the Government of Tanzania (GOT). Its goal is to strengthen the institutional capacity of the GOT to build and promote stronger partnerships among the government, the private sector and civil society to combat corruption.

In the Threshold Program, the GOT's principal objective is to reduce corruption in half of the country's local districts and
in central government agencies. The Threshold program contains the following strategic objectives over the two-year period of the program:

1) An increase in the number of local government authorities participating in public expenditure tracking.
2) An increase in the number of investigations by the Prevention of Corruption Bureau that result in an anticorruption case being presented in court.
3) An increase in the media exposure of anti-corruption cases brought to trial.
4) The establishment and operationalization of a Financial Intelligence Unit to investigate or report and bring to the attention of proper authorities and the public, cases of suspicious or unusual financial transactions.
5) The execution of a program of audits of selected central government ministries/departments/agencies and local government authorities over the 2-year period of the Threshold Program reported by the media.

To meet these objectives, the MCA Threshold Program is commencing activities in four areas:
a) civil society and media strengthening;
b) rule-of-law initiatives including support for a Legal Aid Network and training for investigators, prosecutors and magistrates;
c) support for establishing a Financial Intelligence Unit; and
d) a public procurement reform initiative which will involve the execution of local and national government audits as well as the training of investigators on corruption in procurement.

<DESC>Description:

This ad supersedes the previous ad posted January 29, 2007 through February 13, 2007 for solicitation 5VA0086.  The purpose of this amendment is to change the lease term from a 5 year firm term to a term of 5 years with termination rights after September 15, 2011 (approximately 4 years and 7 months).

Notice of intent to use Other Than Full and Open competition: The Government currently occupies 9,729 BOMA rentable square feet of space at 1555 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA under Lease Number?s GS-11B-60323, which expired on February 13, 2007.  The tenant in this location is scheduled to move into federally owned space by no later than September 15, 2011.  The General Services Administration plans to execute a full service succeeding lease with a 5 year term with termination rights after 4 years and 7 months.  Because moving would require a double move in a short time frame for this tenant, the Government will relocate only if cost of relocation and duplication is included in the rental consideration and the property is in Rosslyn, an Arlington, VA sub-market.  If anyone has a location that they would like to have considered, please contact James Joiner, Jr. at 202.208.1101 by March 7, 2007.

The purpose of this amendment is to change the lease term from a 5 year firm term to a term of 5 years with termination rights after September 15, 2011 (approximately 4 years and 5 months).

Notice of intent to use Other Than Full and Open competition: The Government currently occupies 22,413 BOMA rentable square feet of space at 1555 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA under Lease Number GS-11B-70325, which expires on March 31, 2007.  The tenant in this location is scheduled to move into federally owned space by no later than September 15, 2011.  The General Services Administration plans to execute a full service succeeding lease with a 5 year term with termination rights after 4 years and 5 months.  Because moving would require a double move in a short time frame for this tenant, the Government will relocate only if cost of relocation and duplication is included in the rental consideration and the property is in Rosslyn, an Arlington, VA sub-market.  If anyone has a location that they would like to have considered, please contact James Joiner, Jr. at (202) 208.1101 by March 7, 2007.


Term: 
5 year term with termination rights after 4 years and 5 months.

Owners & Agents:  
To submit a location for inspection, contact this office by March 7, 2007.  Owners and exclusive agents only.  Anyone else must provide a letter of authorization from the building owner.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army, Fort Carson, Colorado intends to negotiate a sole source, brand name purchase order with Legacy Communications, Inc for a NICE Recording System.

The existing system is an older Dictaphone System that has one Trunking Channel cap ability.  The existing Dictaphone System is now licensed by Nice Systems. Fort Carson has an existing Motorola 4.13 Trunking System that was installed and is maintained by Motorola on separate contracts.  This existing radio communication trunking system is proprietary and all components of the Logging System must be approved an d certified by Motorola.  Legacy Communications, Inc is an authorized and certified representative for Motorola in Colorado and currently provides maintenance for the 4.13 system.  The new system will have the capability of  increased storage capacity and 16 channel logging capacity. The installation of the Motorola 4.13 Trunking System at Fort Carson with an original cost of more than 11.0 million dollars has locked this installation into a proprietary agreement, and to ensure continued contractor support non-proprietary systems canno t be placed on the system.  The estimated cost of this procurement is $160,000.00 and is not sufficient to justify using non-Proprietary components. The only alternative is to use non-proprietary components, but the resulting cost of support cannot be justified considering the overall cost of the existing system and support agreements with Motorola. This is a sole source brand name procurement under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.320-1) and (FAR 13.501).  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES, however; any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the date of the publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in SUFFICIENT detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requir ements listed above.  Responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.  If no responses are rece ived, the Government will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Legacy Communication, Inc.  Responses are due 7:00 PM (MST) 04 March 2007.  NAICS: 517212; Business Size Standard 750 employees. Responses shall be submitted via e-mail.  Telephone req uests or inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

Revised 26 January 2007


REQUIREMENT: 

Engineering and Technical Support for Promina Networks in Iraqi theater of operations.
 

PROPONENT:
 
1.  Organization: Deputy Chief of Staff, Communication and Information Systems & MNF-I Strategic Telecom Signal Battalion (STSB)

2.  Location: Victory Base, Baghdad, Iraq

3.  Supervisor: MAJ Karen S. Goldston (STSB XO) /MAJ James Bryant (STSB S3) 
d. Phone: DSN 318-822-2957/1046
 
BACKGROUND:

Promina nodes are essential components of the MNF-I Communications Network. All battlefield functional applications supporting MNF-I maneuver, logistics, command and control, fire support, and air defense are exchanged through Promina Nodes. In addition, Promina Nodes allow the MNF-I to connect into the Global Information Grid (GIG) to obtain strategic network services such as DSN, NIPRNET, SIPRNET, JWICS, DRSN, and commercial telephone access (US). As such, specialized technical engineering support is critical to maintain the Promina system.
 
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

1.  Technical engineering support will help maintain the current network software version, assist in troubleshooting and repair, provide expert technical advice for circuit restoration at forward locations, and provide subject matter expertise and advice to the Director C6 and Network Branch Chief. In addition, technical support will assist in node certification to meet theater installation requirements for network entry and expert liaison between DISA SWA, DISA Europe, DISA CONUS, MNC-I, and MNF-I units. 

2.  Contractor providing the support must be Certified Level VI Promina Systems Engineers, able to provide the level of technical expertise necessary to quickly and accurately identify system faults during outages related to network Promina?s.  In addition, contractor should possess the level of expertise during network planning to provide recommendations as to the installation of new nodes as well as the operability of existing nodes to include recommendations for measures that should be taken to prevent disruption of network services.  Contractor must have the ability to perform network system administration functions; specifically: initializing the node, connect to debugger (for internal software issues), and connect to VxWorks Shell (to manage the file structures and upgrade nodes).  Should also posses the ability to switch nodal domains, and remotely manage any node within the Iraq Area of Responsibility.
 
SPECIFIC TASK DESCRIPTION:
 
1.  Performance Objective / Requirement:

Duty:  The contractor shall serve as a Promina node technical advisor to MNC-I and MNF-I; and shall provide subject matter expertise to interface with DISA, Tier Zero Nodes, and STEP sites.  This will include: ensuring the current software is maintained in the network, updating software as directed by MNF-I CIS, validating requirements for Node installation to MNF-I CIS, and ensuring the new nodes are using appropriate software prior to entering the network.  

Travel:  The contractor shall visit forward locations as required to provide on-site subject matter expertise on equipment interfaces between Promina and user equipment.
 
2.  Performance Standard:

Duty:  Contractor will provide assessment and recommendations regarding engineering, installation, operation, and maintenance of Promina nodes located throughout the network.  Contractor is expected to maintain all MNF-I and MNC-I Promina nodes with the current DISA approved software versions and facilitate updating others which are owned by MNC-I and MNF -I, but not in system.  Contractor will accurately verify that nodes meet Corps and Force installation requirements for entry into the network and accurately ensure that nodes are fully operational with respect to Promina functionality.

Travel:  Given the elevated level of access to the Promina nodes in theater, provide accurate and effective troubleshooting and advice on interfacing Promina and user equipment.  Contractor personnel will never be allowed to travel alone, and will never be authorized use of a tactical or non-tactical vehicle for travel outside Victory Main without a military escort and required Force Protection measures. Travel requirements will be coordinated through and approved by the MNF-I STSB.
 
3.  Acceptance Quality:

Duty:  In the instance of a software upgrade, the contractor will have 90 days to upgrade the nodes located throughout Iraq upon receipt of the new software.  This is based on 30 nodes in country, and a standard of 3 days to upgrade each node.  This will be subject to modification by the supervisor based on the current number of nodes located in theater as well as extenuating factors which might necessitate additional time for the upgrades. 

Travel:  Contractor may be required to travel to any node to provide assistance or conduct an assessment.  Upon arrival, contractor will inform the STSB S3 how long is necessary to conduct the assessment; install the new node (to include the steps necessary in completing the install) or develop a strategy to troubleshoot the problem (to include a timeline outlining what needs to be done and the timeframe necessary to complete the tasks at hand.  All travel to visit forward locations is coordinated through and approved by the MNF-I STSB S3 or designated representative based upon the current theater network and threat assessment.

4.  Monitoring Method:

Duty:  Assist Regional Network Operations and Security Center in providing a written report for all outages due to Promina issues.  Document the current software version for each node through a spreadsheet/database readily available to the STSB S3.  Any and all issues concerning the software will also be documented in this manner.  All upgrades and issues will be reported to the supervisor. 
 
Travel:  Daily accountability of contractor personnel during site visits is provided to the MNF-I STSB S3 or designated representative.  This will include an in-depth report as to the days activities, what tasks were accomplished, any issues that remain, and estimated timeline for return to home station.

5.  Deliverables:

The contractor will provide a written report for each outage based on an issue with a Promina node, as well as a written, assessment/report of each node both at the time of installation, and bi-annually.  Daily SITREP?s, reports on all activity concerning the node, documentation of all issues and troubleshooting procedures, as well as an overall assessment of the node.

 6.  Impact on Mission if not contracted:
 
 1.  The Promina Nodes within the Iraq AOR fall in under DISA SWA's authority.  DISA regularly requires the software to be upgraded to stay within compliance of the latest JTIC approved software as directed by NETCOM.  The latest version of software will require hardware updates as well (3 Promina Processor Modules; the processors, with 32M of RAM on each for the P800s and new Flash Chips on the P400s).  Upgrading the software involves pushing code from either another node within the network, or FTPing it from a laptop onto the PSM (Promina Server Module; essentially the harddrive for the node), both of which require a Level 6 Login.  Occasionally the redundancy of the nodal domain controller will get hung and need to be switched, which also requires a level 6 login.  

2.  The main issue would be when there are problems with a node that the local contractors or O&M technicians are not trained in performing or would otherwise require a Promina Field Service Engineer to perform.  Without having a Promina Engineer in country, it would require a lengthy process to request an engineer to be cleared for deployment and actually be deployed into the Iraq AOR; which the rapid pace of our battle rhythm does not permit.

3.  The Promina Engineer also serves as a liaison between the Army and other government and civilian agencies such as DISA and CACI, which allows for smoother interactions (I can basically get things pushed through that otherwise would take more time and effort on the Army's part).  I also serve as a Subject Matter Expert for Promina Operations, assist in Engineering and Installation, and serve as a historical reference for continuity.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:

21 Mar 07 to 20 Mar 08, to include one (1) option year.  Upon exercising the option period, MNF-I will re-evaluate the need to retain a Promina subject matter expert at Victory Base. This will be based on the status of the network, as well as, the relevance and level of expertise the technician has demonstrated to CJCCC during the contract period.
 
QUALITY ASSURANCE REPRESENTATIVE (QAR):

Primary: MAJ Karen Goldston, Alt: MAJ James Bryant, STSB, Bldg 9, Victory Base Iraq, DSN 318-822-2957/1046.
 
PLACE OF DUTY/ACCOUNTABILITY:

The primary place of duty will be in the MNF-I STSB location at Victory Base Main, Baghdad, Iraq. Trips to conduct business outside of Victory Main will be of short duration and will not involve an alternative place of duty, but may require an overnight stay to complete mission requirements or to observe Force Protection requirements. Contractor personnel under this effort will be added to the sponsoring unit's JPERSTAT report, and accountability will be reported daily.
 
GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIAL (GFM) AND GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT (GFE):

The Government will provide, at the same level as provided to military staff personnel, office space, automation equipment, telephone access, electronic mail and appropriate network connectivity, software, and consumable office supplies necessary to perform contract requirements. The Government will provide transportation and communication assets necessary to complete contract mission requirements. The Government will provide all Promina equipment, cables, site prep, spares, as well as proper power/ground feed to Promina racks, and secure cabinets for Promina equipment as required
 
WORK HOURS:

Anticipated schedules for contractor personnel are based on an 84-hour work-week. Work shifts, meal times, and time off will be coordinated and approved by the QAR or by MNF-I STSB designated representative. Dynamic military missions may require flexibility of work schedule, and contractor personnel shall be on-call 24/7 during the contract period of performance. All work schedule changes to support missions will be coordinated with the MNF-I STSB representative and approved by the QAR in order to maintain the 84 hour per week anticipated schedule.


LIFE SUPPORT:

1.  IAW AR 600-700, the government will provide life support services to contractor personnel equivalent to those provided to military personnel. Specifically, those services at Victory Main shall include:
 
a. Billeting. Contractor personnel are to be provided living space in accordance with theater guidelines and local camp facilities. In the short term, that may be tents with cots and shower and toilet facilities. As base improvements continue, contractor personnel will be moved along with military personnel into living containers or hardstand buildings. In accordance with DA guidance, all contractor personnel in the deployed theater of operations will be given a Government Service (GS) equivalency grade of GS12 or GSI3, depending on skill level and responsibility. For this effort, contractor personnel will be granted a GS?12 equivalency. As such, contractors will be provided living container space equivalent to a Military 03. Living trailers may not include plumbing, but shower and toilet facilities are available in the immediate area. Living accommodations will include power, AC/Heat, beds with linen, nightstand, and wardrobe.

b. Dining Facilities and Water: Contractor personnel shall have unlimited access to the Victory Main Dining Facilities at no cost, and to other camp Dining Facilities when on approved travel. Bottled water is regularly delivered to the camp and is available at no charge to military and civilian personnel.
	
c. Laundry Service. Contractor personnel may use the same no cost laundry service provided to military personnel. Currently at Victory Main, drop off of dirty laundry can be done 7 days per week, and pick up of clean laundry 3-4 days later. There is no dry-cleaning service.
 
d. Post/Base Exchange: Contractor personnel shall have access to the PX/BX at Victory Main and at other military camps during trips by virtue of their Government issued ID card (DD Form 1172-2).
 
e. Financial Support: The government will provide a memorandum to the contractor personnel authorizing them to utilize the servicing military financial support unit at Victory Main for check cashing privileges equal to those of military personnel. The contractor will provide a memorandum for the finance office guaranteeing sufficient funds for any checks cashed by contractor personnel. There are no commercial banks at Victory Main, so banking and currency exchange services are not available.
 
f. Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Facilities: Contractors will be provided unlimited access to MWR facilities available at Victory Main and other military camps during trips, to include gymnasiums, pools, theaters, sports facilities and other recreational facilities.
 
g. Medical / Dental Care: All medical facilities in the MNF-I area of responsibility will provide contractor employees with medical care when life, limb, or eyesight is jeopardized and for emergency medical and dental care. Emergency care is defined as that care which a reasonable person believes constitutes a condition or may result in a condition that requires, or may require, immediate medical attention. An emergency is an acute or emergent condition that requires immediate medical attention. Examples of emergency include, but are no limited to: refills of prescription drugs such as insulin and other life dependent drugs, broken bones, lacerations, and broken teeth or lost fillings. Routine medical or dental care is not authorized and will not be provided by Army Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) to civilian contractor personnel.
 
h. Remains Processing: In accordance with DA guidance and AMC policy, remains of contractor personnel will be handled the same as remains of military personnel, and will be collected and transported to Kuwait. The government will notify the contractor to coordinate movement of remains back to home of record, and to ensure proper notification of the next of kin.

i. Uniforms and Weapons: By direction of the theater commander, contractor personnel are not authorized to wear any type of military uniform or carry any type of firearm. The contractor may choose to designate a company uniform or dress code, but the government does not require it and will not fund the purchase of such company uniforms.

DEPLOYMENT PROCESSING:

1.  In accordance with DA guidance, all contractor personnel deploying to the Iraqi theater of operations are required to process through the Civilian Replacement Center operated by TRADOC at Fort Bliss, Texas. Contracting Officer will provide a Letter of Verification to contractor personnel validating their contractual employment and authority to process for deployment at the CRC, as well as the appropriate GS Equivalency grade authorized. In accordance with DA guidelines, contractor personnel under this contract effort will be granted a GS-12 equivalency. The contractor shall coordinate directly with the CRC to schedule attendance. This processing will provide the following, and therefore these items will not be included as a part of government support in this contract:

a. Organizational clothing and individual equipment (OCIE).
 
 		1.  Chemical Defensive Equipment (CDE), to include protective mask, chemical suits, decontamination kits, and training on their proper use. (NOTE: Recent changes in the Iraqi theater protective posture may change the requirement for personnel to deploy with CDE, but the CRC will follow latest guidance).
 
2.  Common Access Card (CAC), which is the DOD identification card. The card will include the GS Equivalency grade for contract employees (GS-12E) for this effort, as well as the Geneva Convention category. The CAC will be coded to the time of deployment stated in the contract.
 
		3.  Medical Screening, to include dental pantograph, all required immunizations, DNA sampling, and HN screening, as well as specific medical briefings pertinent to conditions in Iraq.
 
2.  Normal procedure is for the contract personnel processing through the CRC to deploy directly from the CRC site to the Iraqi theater through one of several available APODs on military chartered aircraft. Contractor may choose to seek a waiver to this requirement and allow the contract personnel to travel via commercial air to meet urgent schedule and support requirements. If the government provides a waiver to military charter flights, cost of commercial transportation is allowable under the contract. If the contractor chooses to send employees commercially without a government waiver, the government will not reimburse costs for this travel.

3.  If contractor personnel have already been properly processed for deployment, re-processing through the CRC is not required. However, the contractor shall certify that all deployment processing has been completed properly and in accordance with DA guidelines.
 
4.  Upon arrival in theater, contractor personnel shall register with the AMC civilian support cell located at the arriving APOD. This allows AMC to initiate accountability of the contract personnel in theater, and to coordinate with the sponsor unit for transportation and escort of contractor personnel to the place of duty.
 
5.  Contractor personnel shall have a valid passport and a Kuwaiti Visa. It is the responsibility of the contractor to obtain these documents prior to processing through the CRC. The letter of verification provided by the Contracting Officer will also serve as justification for the Kuwaiti Visa.
 
SECURITY CLEARANCES:  

Contractor personnel shall have at least a Secret level clearance to be able to perform the requirements outlined in this SOW.
 
LEAVE: 

Contractor is authorized 10 days of leave per every 90 days in Iraq.  Personnel serving in Iraq are eligible to participate in the Army R&R program, but will be given last priority behind military and DoD Civilian personnel. Therefore, the contractor may include costs to provide commercial travel to and from Iraq to the U.S. for one leave period of no more than 14 continuous days. Additionally, leave may be taken outside the guidelines of the Army R&R program at cost to contractor, as long as the contractor?s leave does not exceed 14 continuous days per instance of leave.  Cost of air travel will be IAW the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR).  Schedule for leave must be coordinated and approved by the MNF-I STSB S3 or designated representative before travel arrangements are made.  The contractor is not required to provide a replacement worker during this approved leave period. Emergency Leave will be granted following the same procedures used by the military. The government will grant immediate emergency leave to contractor personnel following official notification and validation by the Red Cross. Emergency leave taken by contractor personnel will be substituted for allowable regular leave. If emergency leave exceeds the allowed 14 day regular leave period, or if regular leave has already been taken, the government will not pay hourly salaries for the additional leave time. If emergency leave is expected to exceed 15 days, the contractor shall provide replacement personnel to fulfill the requirements of the contract.
 
REPLACEMENT PERSONNEL:

If at any time during the period of performance, contractor personnel are not able to continue work through no fault or direction of the government, the contractor shall replace them within 15 days at no additional cost to the government.
 
CELL PHONES/PERSONAL COMPUTERS:

The government will provide adequate computer support and telephone access to meet the stated requirements. The government will not pay for rent, lease, purchase or sustainment of personal cell phones or computers for contractor personnel.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, Restoration Center in partnership with the New Bedford Harbor Trustee Council and Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, is in need of a contractor to complete fish passage improvements, including demolition and restoration activities, along the Acushnet River at the Sawmill and Hamlin Street dams in order to maximize access to riverine and lacustrine spawning habitats for anadromous fish for the Acushnet River Fish Passage Restoration Project in Acushnet, Massachusetts.  The project consists of constructing nature-like fishways at the Sawmill Dam and Hamlin Street Dam.  

The contractor shall construct a flow constrictor/step pool structure below the Sawmill Dam spillway which will extend from the top of the Sawmill Dam spillway for a distance of approximately 200 ft downstream.  In order to ensure that all river flows will be directed to the restored channel, the existing sluiceway shall be permanently closed, thereby directing all flow through the restored channel alignment, both permanently daylighting this reach of the river and eliminating dry, no-flow periods in the restored reach of the river channel.  The flow constrictor/ step pool shall be constructed from carefully placed, large rock boulders.  Imbricated riprap walls shall also be used to stabilize slopes adjacent to the step pool system.  The contractor shall use vegetative plantings to stabilize slopes above flood elevations, along the upper slopes and the tops of banks. The contractor shall also notch the Sawmill Dam spillway and remove a building that straddles the river channel.

At the Hamlin Street Dam site, the contractor shall construct a flow constrictor/ step weir system from carefully placed, large rock boulders that shall be set essentially perpendicular to flow across the streambed at strategic locations.  Imbricated riprap walls shall also be used to stabilize slopes adjacent to the step weir system.  The contractor shall use vegetative plantings to stabilize slopes above flood elevations, along the upper slopes and the tops of banks.

The resultant procurement will be a firm-fixed price contract.  This will be a 100% small business set-aside.  The North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 237990.  The size standard for Small Business is $31 million.   The estimated price range of this project is $500,000 to $1,000,000.  Completion time for this project is one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed.

<DESC>The US Agency for International Development (USAID/Washington) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on behalf of its Mission in the Republic of Haiti in anticipation of a cost-reimbursement, level of effort contract to provide technical assistance to the new democratically-elected Government of Haiti.  To enhance Haitis capacity to undertake an ambitious development plan, the Government of Haiti (GOH) has requested US technical assistance in implementing significant reforms and modernizing state functions based on best practice models.  To assist the GOH in its effort, USAID intends to provide for the services of technical advisors to GOH Ministries and Offices (Ministries of Planning and External Cooperation, Commerce, Education, Agriculture, Justice, Public Works, Womens Affairs, Environment, Finance, the Investment Facilitation Center, the Prime Ministers Office, et al) under an Advisory and Assistance Services contract that will expand US support over the next three years (2007 / 2010), helping to strengthen GOH institutions and to ensure that the USG and other donor investments continue to achieve their full potential while instilling best practices in the institutions supported.  The successful contractor will work with the GOH Ministry of Plan and External Cooperation and USAID/Haiti to determine the placement of advisors based on a needs assessment or in response to a request for technical assistance.  This is a three-year activity, including one base year and two option years.
This requirement will be subject to full and open competition and the procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 shall apply.  The authorized geographic code for this activity is 000 (U.S.) and the cooperating country.  Total estimated level of effort is anticipated to be 1,272 person months over a 3 year period (one base year and two option years).  USAID strongly encourages the participation of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small businesses in this activity as prime contractor or as subcontractor in accordance with FAR Part 19.

USAID anticipates the award of a single contract with a three year period of performance (including options).  In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium.  Requests for other copies of the RFP will be disregarded without notice to the requestor.  No phone requests will be accepted, no RFP will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed.           

Please do not contact USAID/Haiti directly.  All communication must be directed through USAID Washington.  The release of this notice in no way obligates USAID or the US Government to release an RFP or make an award of any type.

<DESC>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --   Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) Background:  The C-17 Training Systems Integrated Product Team at  Wright-Patterson AFB OH is responsible for the development, fielding and  sustainment of aircrew and maintenance training devices, concurrency of  those devices, and aircrew instruction.  The breadth of this effort  expands across eight USAF bases in CONUS, two in PACAF, and an Australian  FMS base.  The C-17 Aircrew Training System (ATS) is comprised of seven  different training devices of which, to date, 163 out of 179 devices have  been fielded.  The C-17 Maintenance Training System (MTS), on the other  hand, is comprised of ten different devices with 28 of 37 devices fielded.  Whereas ATS devices can be found at every C-17 base, only seven USAF bases  will eventually house the MTS devices. (d) The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with the  formulation of the acquisition strategy and to ascertain your interest in  bidding on a 10-year C-17 ATS/MTS Sustainment Re-Compete program.  This  program is comprised of three components; 1) ATS and MTS Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS), 2) ATS Instruction, and 3) ATS and MTS  Concurrency Management.  The offerors will be asked to bid on a combined  program encapsulating all of the components list above.  They will also be  given the opportunity to bid on an ATS-only piece  (CLS/Instruction/Concurrency) and/or an MTS-only piece (CLS/Concurrency). 1.  Describe your past experience for performing contractor logistics  support, instruction, and/or concurrency management to include: 	Program name 	Government or contractor POC 	Description of the effort; i.e., number of locations supported, number  of personnel assigned, etc. 	Date & period of performance 	Cost of effort 	Description of support strategy, i.e., guaranteed student, on-call,  modified on-call, etc. 2.	In an effort to instill contractual flexibility to react quickly to  budget fluctuations, were looking for ways to implement a throttle  mechanism.  By this we want the capability to surge as well a scale back  on the CLS effort.  What ideas might you have to accomplish this and have  you implemented it on a previous program? 3.  What innovative ways have you used in the past, or could possibly  envision to keep CLS costs down to include integrating the two systems  together? 4.  In carrying out this effort, what would be your reliance on government  personnel and what would be required of them? 5.  What data will you require of the government to assemble a proposal  for this effort? 6.  What risks do you foresee in performing this effort?  What steps would  you likely take to mitigate the risks? Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically  disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business  concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native  American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is  foreign-owned.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a  source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  Interested sources  must respond with a complete Request for Information package of no more  than 10 pages though, providing everything requested above.

<DESC>The U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) is managed by the National Science Foundation, an independent agency of the U.S. Government, pursuant to NSC Memorandum 71 (1971) as reaffirmed in Presidential Memorandum 6646 (1982).  PM6646 states: Every effort shall be made to manage the program in a manner that maximizes the cost effectiveness and return on investment.
    
In meeting its responsibilities, NSF arranges for all USAP logistics support activities, including resupply of the year-round U.S. research station at McMurdo.  

In January 2006, NSF sought information regarding the long-term availability of icebreaking services capable of enabling the resupply of the USAP?s McMurdo Station. That RFI can be viewed at: 

http://www.fbo.gov/spg/NSF/DCCA/CPO/DCCA%2D060024/listing.html

NSF now sees merit in seeking information concerning a complete resupply package (for example, mated icebreakers and cargo/fuel supply vessels that can work in close tow configuration.)  

Background 

NSF is interested in contracting for resupply services to McMurdo Station, Antarctica.  These services would involve annually transporting cargo as specified below to the pier at McMurdo Station, located at 77 deg 51' S, 166 deg 40' E. NSF intends for this to be a long-term arrangement of at least ten years. It is expected that a contract would include annual mobilization and de-mobilization periods (length of time to be determined based on location of home port) and an operating period in the Southern Ocean south of 60 deg S of approximately 6 to 8 weeks, but the operating period may differ with the type of resupply package that is proposed. After that period the vessels would be off-contract and free to engage in other work.

The service would deliver fuel, containers and break bulk to McMurdo Station, Antarctica, as well as retrograde of materials from McMurdo Station to the U.S or to an acceptable transfer point.  The nominal current annual requirements are identified below and in the attached spreadsheets. 

Fuel (gallons)
o	AN-8 3.5 million
o	JP-5 3.0 million
o	Gasoline 250 thousand

Cargo Delivered
o	Containers (TEU): 600
o	Break Bulk (Pounds): 1.5 million

Cargo Retrograded
o	500 TEU
o	500,000 lbs break bulk

At present, fuel storage (ullage) in McMurdo is such that delivery of the above fuel quantities must be made each year.  However, the USAP plans to increase the ullage such that skipping one year without re-fueling will be possible.  

The container and break-bulk cargo listed in the attached chart includes a considerable amount of cargo dedicated to the re-building of South Pole Station.  It is expected that the volume of delivery will decrease somewhat in coming years.  NSF would consider a proposal for a smaller ship if it could be demonstrated that a double shuttle from a port in the Southern Ocean could be timely and cost-effective.

Traditionally, the USAP has relied on the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to open a channel in the sea ice and then to escort cargo and fuel supply vessels using its POLAR class ships. The cargo and fuel delivery vessels have been ice strengthened vessels chartered by the Military Sealift Command (MSC).  The USCG vessels are 30 years old and are reaching the end of their design life. The MSC vessels are not configured for close coupling with icebreaking vessels configured with a towing notch.  

It is envisioned under this RFI that the icebreaking capability and the resupply ship(s) are all to be offered as one complete, integrated package under direct contract to NSF. 

Partnering arrangements will be welcomed.  For example, it may be that one partner would supply an icebreaker and another would provide the supply ships.

NSF is not seeking binding offers to contract at this time; however, based upon the information received the Foundation may initiate discussions, seek offers, and award a contract with an owner or operator per the authority at 42 U.S.C. 1870(c). 

The United States Antarctic Program 

Scientific research, and operational support of that research, is the principal activity supported in Antarctica by the United States Government. The goals are to expand fundamental knowledge of the region, to foster research on global and regional problems of current scientific importance, and to utilize the region as a platform from which to support research. For projects involving fieldwork, the USAP supports research that can only or can best be done in Antarctica. 

The Program has been in continuous operation since the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year and continuation into the foreseeable future is anticipated. U.S. activities in Antarctica support the Nation's adherence to the Antarctic Treaty, which reserves the region for peaceful purposes and encourages international cooperation in scientific research. At present, 45 nations adhere to the treaty, and 29 of them are involved in Antarctic field activities. The United States cooperates scientifically and operationally with many of the Antarctic Treaty nations. 

The major logistics hub for the support of this science is McMurdo Station. McMurdo is located on Ross Island in the Southern edge of the Ross Sea. It is the furthest south exposed land to which a ship can sail. 

Refer to http://nsf.gov/od/opp/prss/ for a more complete description of the USAP research support facilities including McMurdo Station. 

Present Schedule and Operations 

The current plan of operation and schedule is provided for information purposes.  Responses to this RFI are not bound to keep within the current mode of operation; in fact respondents are encouraged to review the current operating plans and schedules and to provide innovative suggestions for changes.  

Respondents are encouraged to review the ?Report of the Office of Polar Programs, Office Advisory Committee, subcommittee on U.S. Antarctic Program resupply? for a review of ship resupply and other innovative resupply issues.  This report may be viewed at:
 
 
The report is at: 
 
http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=104354&org=ANT&from=news
 

Under the current operations, the USCG icebreaker typically arrives at 60 deg S on or about December 25. Anticipated departure from McMurdo is mid-February of the following year (6-8 weeks after arrival). The basic tasks are to open a channel to the McMurdo Station pier, and escort a tanker and a freighter through the sea ice and channel to the pier and back to the open ocean as required .

The freighter used during the 2005/2006 season was the AMERICAN TERN (17,350 tons, 158.8m/23.16m). The tanker used was the LAWRENCE GIANELLA, one of five sister ships of the T-5 class (33,093 tons, 187.5m/21.2m). Additional information on these vessels may be found at: 
http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp'ship=americantern&type
=ContainerShip 
and 
http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp'ship=paulbuck&type=GovernmentownedTanker. 

The U.S. Navy, Military Sealift Command provides these vessels for the USAP. The tanker loads at differing ports each year and arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about January 16. It departs on or about January 20 each year. The freighter loads at Port Hueneme, California, and Lyttleton, New Zealand, and arrives at the McMurdo ice edge on or about February 1 each year.  It departs on or about February 11. 

Sea Ice 
The fast ice in McMurdo Sound has typically been between 7 to 10 feet maximum thickness for a distance of 10 to 20 miles from McMurdo. It is often first or second year ice and had rarely been third year ice until very recently.  For the past five years there have been extraordinary ice conditions due at least in part to the presence of large icebergs that were partially blocking McMurdo Sound. Ice thicknesses were as great as 12 feet. The icebergs have moved out of the area since last year.  It is possible that the coming season's ice could start to return to a more normal status in the short term, but clearly conditions can change rapidly and persist for extended periods. 
A more extensive review of the sea ice conditions may be read at the RFI issued in January 2006 and referenced in the opening paragraph above.  

Evaluation Information 
Interested parties are free to provide any information that they believe may assist NSF in its evaluation of the availability and reliability of the proposed resupply package; however, the Foundation will not pay for any information submitted. 

Except as identified herein, no specific format is required. 
Among the evaluation factors that NSF would consider in determining suitability of an icebreaking/resupply package would be: 

o  System economics
o  Performance
o  Reliability
o  Flexibility
o  Marketability (when not on USAP charter). 

It is highly desirable that the vessels proposed have sufficient fuel storage to complete the entire Antarctic operation without any refueling from McMurdo. Please specifically indicate whether the intended vessel has the fuel storage capacity to enable this. 

To read more about the fuel available at McMurdo, please read the January 2006 RFI. 

Thank you in advance for your interest in the acquisition programs of the National Science Foundation. Though NSF will consider any information interested parties choose to submit at any time, the privilege of your submission on or prior to January 31, 2007, is requested. 

Inquiries of a technical nature may be addressed to Dr. Michael Van Woert, Executive Officer, National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs, Room 755, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230; by telephone to +1 (703) 292-8030; or by e-mail to mvanwoer@nsf.gov.

SELECTION CRITERIA:  The selection criteria for this project are listed below in descending order of importance. Proposals will be evaluated on each of the criteria factors listed below.  Each factor will be assigned a rating from outstanding to unsatisfactory based on the risk to the government that the offeror will successfully pe rform the factor being evaluated.  An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission.  Award will be made to the firm(s) determined to be most highly qualified.  Factors listed below will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: Signif icantly More Important - means that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor.  More Important - means that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater.  Equal - means that the factor is of  the same value or nearly the same as another factor.  For this solicitation, Factor 1  Specialized Experience and Technical Competence and Factor 2  Key Personnel are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Factor 3  Past P erformance and Factor 4  Work Management and significantly more important than Factor 5  Small Business Participation and Factor 6  Volume of DoD Contract Awards.  Past Performance and Work Management are weighted equally and each factor individually is  more important than Small Business Participation and Volume of DoD Contract Awards.

<DESC>1.	Project Description

National Security Technologies (NSTec) is the management and operations contractor for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) at the Nevada Test Site (NTS).  The NNSA has tasked NSTec with treating Mixed (radioactive and hazardous) Waste in preparation for disposal.

The NTS has generated waste streams that consist of radioactive and hazardous wastes that cannot be disposed of without required treatment. The waste consists of one population of sludge (9 drums) and one population of debris (20 drums).

Treatment is required for the following reason:

a.	Rendering the waste Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) compliant with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements.

<DESC>Web Based E-Learning for Saudi Arabia This is a combined Sources Sought and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM)  Synopsis. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor  does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This  synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any  purpose.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This  Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United  States Air Force to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling a  Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirement for the upgrade of the Royal  Saudi Air Force (RSAF) School of Command, Control and Communications  (School of C3) at Prince Sultan Air Base, located in Al Kharj, Saudi  Arabia.  In addition, we are also asking that each interested source  provide this office with an estimate (Rough Order of Magnitude) of their  perceived overall cost of this requirement. Specifically, the contractor will provide all engineering services to  fabricate/procure, install and deliver to the RSAF a turnkey system  totally modernizing a minimum of eleven (11) up to a maximum of twenty  three (23) classrooms at the School of C3.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to purchase 10 each of the following item from Systems With Reliability Inc (SWR); Antenna, National Weather Radar (NWR) Transmitter, 8 Bay, w/Power Divider, Phasing Harness, Mounting Brackets, SWR P/N WRX/8 (Uses EIA Flange Connector, For Use w/Heliax Cable) NSN:  5985-01-450-4482. SWR is the sole manufacturer of the SWR 8 Bay NWR antenna system that the NWS uses with the SRS NWR (NOAA Weather Radio) transmitters. Each antenna system consists of an 8-bay element with power divider, phasing harness, mounting brackets, and an EIA 7/8? flange connector, for use with Heliax cable.  The antenna (over 200 in use) is used for the NWR transmitters for proper signal propagation.  The Government has purchased these units from SWR, Inc. for the past twelve years with excellent performance and reliability. This procurement will provide replacement units for old damaged antennas already in use.  If a different antenna manufacturer is used the cost of logistic support to the Government will by far exceed the value of open competition. Futhermore, a change in source cannot guarantee the existing pattern coverage. This item is proprietary to Systems With Reliability Inc. (SWR) who is the only source of supply. Because the Government does not have the manufacturer?s drawings for this part, it would not be economical to attempt to re-procure this part as a ?build-to-print?. Therefore, it is recommended to purchase the item by part number.  This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO.  The intended procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  However, all proposals received within 10 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to Systems With Reliability, Inc., whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this product.  Interested firms should submit its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified antenna or a antenna that provides the same fit, form and function as that specified.

Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other Government agency to which it has previously provided the item. Offerors may send their proposal to email address karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 816-274-6952 ATTN: Karen Christian. The NAICS code for this requirement is 334413.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency.

<SUBJECT>B -- Scientific Technical and Policy Guidance
<DESC>This is a special notice as the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to procure scientific, technical and policy guidance from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), Washington DC.  These services will be procured on a non-competitive basis in accordance with FAR Part 13, through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-15. The purpose of the resulting PO is to review a Climate Change Science Program draft Synthesis and Assessment Product Number 3.2, entitled "Climate Projections Based on Emissions Scenarious for Long-lives Radiatively Active Trace Gases".  The NAS will provide detailed peer review of the draft document.  This review will be performed by a committee of approximately 10 members that is composed of a range of disciplines. The NAS is a single source with unique capabilities.  Created in 1863 by the U.S. Congress and dedicated to the furtherance of science, the NAS draws upon 2,000 scientists and engineers elected to lifetime memberships based on their contributions to science and technology.  The independent members serve without compensation and offer advice and counsel, largely free of bias, in the areas of their expertise.  No other source is known to possess the NAS capability.  This action is taken under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Any source possessing the capability may respond and will be considered.  A justification for other than full and open competition is on file.  The reference number is NRMT0000-7-07191.

The Aeronautical Systems Center F-22 System Program Office (ASC/YFK) will release a Request for Proposal  (RFP) on or about February 27, 2007, to the Lockheed Martin Aeronautics  (LMA) Company for a long-term Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  sustainment contract for the F-22 air vehicle.  ASC/YFK anticipates  awarding a long term PBL contract for sustainment of the present/future  F-22 fielded fleet on or about December 1, 2007.  The period of  performance for the contract associated with this synopsis is Calendar  Year (CY) 08-CY17.  This acquisition is a follow-on to the sole source  sustainment effort currently being performed by Lockheed Martin  Aeronautics (LMA), under the F-22 production contract FA8611-05-C-2850.  The purpose of this notification is to announce release of the request for  Proposal (RFP) for potential subcontracting purposes. Program Background The Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) Demonstration/Validation phase  involved two competing aircraft teams, led by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics  (with General Dynamics and Boeing as team members) and Northrop (teamed  with McDonnell-Douglas), and two competing engine contractors, General  Electric (GE) and Pratt &Whitney (P&W).     On 23 Apr 91, the Secretary of  the Air Force selected Lockheed Martin Aeronautics for the air vehicle and  overall weapon system integration and P&W for the engine.  The ATF was  re-designated as the F-22, and Milestone II approval was confirmed by an  Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), 1 Aug 91, authorizing F-22  Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and long lead procurement  for four Pre-Production Verification (PPV) air vehicles.  EMD contracts  were awarded in Aug 91.  The air vehicle Preliminary Design Review (PDR)  was completed on 30 Apr 93 and the Critical Design Review (CDR) was  conducted on 20-24 Feb 95.  Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation  (FOT&E) began 29 Aug 05 and completed on 23 Nov 05.  The Joint  Interoperability Test Command (JITC) awarded the F-22 Joint Systems  Interoperability Test Certification on 14 Dec 05, finding the F-22 met all  its critical interoperability requirements and certifying it interoperable  for joint use.  Initial Operating capability (IOC) for the F-22 was  declared on 15 Dec 05.  IOC declaration verifies the aircraft as a fully  capable, multi-mission platform ready for combat. Full and open competition was used in the Demonstration/Validation  (Dem/Val) phase of this program.  The program was down-selected to two  teams for both the air vehicle and engine EMD competition.  As a result of  the competition, Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems (LMAS), currently  Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (LMA) and Pratt & Whitney (P&W) Large  Military Engines received EMD contract awards. LMA currently provides F-22  sustainment support within the production contract and Pratt & Whitney  provides F-119 engine support under a separate contract.  The air vehicle  sustainment program is presently known as Performance-based Agile  Logistics Support (PALS).  The future sustainment effort will establish a  Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract arrangement with partnering of  Air Logistics Centers for depot level repair.  The effort will continue  field sustainment via Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) and  public/private partnering for the entire F-22 fleet. PALS is a two-phased support strategy for the F-22 air vehicle.  Phase I  support (Initial Operational Capability) is provided by the prime air  vehicle contractor and progresses through Phase II (follow-on support),  which includes public-private partnering for depot maintenance as a  fundamental approach.  The PALS concept of operations for the F-22 air  vehicle builds on, and is consistent with, the overall weapon system  support concept, and focuses on system user priorities of availability,  cost, and accountability. The PALS program currently supports United States Air Force (USAF)  operators of the F-22 aircraft.  Full intermediate level (back shop) and  depot heavy maintenance are currently performed and managed by Lockheed  Martin Aeronautics.  Organizational level maintenance of the F-22 fleet  will continue to be performed by USAF maintenance personnel. This F-22 PSI sustainment concept of operations addresses the following  elements of support products and services:  fleet management, material  management, support equipment, technical order data (TOD), maintenance  management and customer technical services.  This effort also includes  follow-on flight test, support of air vehicle modernization, and  modification programs.  The support program elements are implemented with  a shared responsibility between the sustainment prime contractor and the  USAF.

<DESC>tThis is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is solicitation number is HSCG23-07-R-PBF008 and is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This solicitation document will incorporate provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-15.  There is no set aside.  The NAICS code is 488190 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million.  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to award a single Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract for training of maintenance of the U.S. Coast Guard?s Falcon HU-25 aircraft.  The period of performance shall be from on or about April 1, 2007 through March 31, 2008 with four one-year option periods.  Services will be ordered through delivery orders containing Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) line items.  Technical proposal must be submitted separate from the Price Proposal.  Questions regarding this solicitation should be submitted to Wilbert.Mann@uscg.mil by 2:00 pm, March 7, 2007.  Answers will be posted by amendment to this combined synopsis/solicitation.  

The U.S. Coast Guard , Chief of Aeronautical Engineering (CG-41 manages a network of aircraft mechanics across the country that provides safe and operable aircraft ready to perform the various Coast Guard missions on a moments notice.  In order to ensure the safety of our aircrews and the continued excellent stewardship of the American tax-payers resources, the Coast Guard will need to provide its aircraft maintenance personnel with the best ATF-3 aircraft engine maintenance training possible to meet these challenges.  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has a requirement to acquire the services of a commercial vendor to conduct short term instructional courses no longer than two weeks designed to train Coast Guard personnel in shop maintenance procedures for the ATF-3 engine utilized on the HU-25 series aircraft.  This training is to be conducted on-site at one of the four units in the Coast Guard operating the HU-25 aircraft.  This training is to be scheduled on an ?as needed? basis with the likelihood of no more than five sessions in FY 2007.  Topics addressed include but are not limited to the following:  Familiarization with the description and operation of the ATF-3 engine system; Familiarization of removal and installation procedures of engine exterior components; Familiarization of disassembly and reassembly procedures of engine internal components; Familiarization with the inspection procedures of ATF-3 engine systems and components; Familiarization with the proper usage of all related specials tools and equipment; Familiarization with the proper maintenance instruction and documentation.  

The course shall be delivered in a maximum of a two week session.  The training will take place in both a classroom setting and ship/lab environment.  Eighty percent of instruction time should be ?hands on?.  Normal class size will not exceed four students per session.  Course support expected under this contract requirement will be provided under the direction of the United States Coast Guard.  The course shall be held at any of the following Coast Guard units operating the HU-25 aircraft as follows:  Coast Guard Airstation Cape Cod, MA, Coast Guard Airstation Miami, FL, Coast Guard ATC Mobile, AL, and Coast Guard Airstation Corpus Christi, TX.  The workday is defined as an 8 hour workday from 0800-1600/ 8am to 4pm.  The contractor shall provide all necessary materials to perform all tasks except for any Government furnished property.  This includes course material (I.e. handouts, books, etc.) to be used during the training and other required information.  The government will screen and provide all attendees for each course convening date.  Ideally, initial contact between the contractor and the U.S. Coast Guard shall be at least two months prior to the physical start of each convening date.  Contact can be achieved by phone conversation, electronic mail, and physical meeting at Coast Guard Headquarters, Washington, DC, or at the contractor?s facility.  The opportunity for engine availability is normally based on scheduled major inspections coming due, but unscheduled damage and the need to repair is sometimes hard to predict thus it is not uncommon for only a two week prior notification.  Course dates and quotas shall be managed by mutual agreement between the contractor and the U.S. Coast Guard?s representative, the AMT Rating Force Master Chief.  The Contractor shall furnish all facilities materials, equipment and services necessary to fulfill the requirements of this solicitation, except for the Government furnished Information.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for Goddard Education Series (GLES) Program. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Greystone Consulting Inc., in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304 (c) (1)- Only One Responsible Source. Center Management has been looking at all of Goddards Leadership and Management Programs.  All Leadership and Management Programs will be redesigned and will begin in 2008.	Due to the favorable feedback from past participants, Center Management has decided to move forward with the next 2 GLES classes in 2007.  Each session of GLES has been overwhelmingly successful and universally received high accolades.  Since this will be the last 2 times GLES will be offered as a stand-alone Leadership Program which begins March 28, 2007, and registrations already taking place for the upcoming class, competition was not a reasonable use of time. The vendor of choice has already tailored their course to meet NASA requirements and standards for the program that the class is being taught for at this time.	 In the fall of 2004, Greystone personnel delivered the 12-day, pilot program to 44 Goddard managers. The design was highly rated by all attendees. Greystone took the end-of-course feedback and made minor, but substantive changes, and provided a final course design to Goddard. Also included was a color, photo-ready, 315-page participant manual and an extensive reading library of 75 reference books for in-depth reading on any of the course core concepts. Given the success of the pilot program, the Center sponsored three more courses during calendar year 2005. Senior Greystone personnel delivered 17 of the eighteen training modules. Each of these courses have been overwhelmingly successful and universally received high accolades for both content and the professionalism and skills of the Greystone facilitation staff. This course is now viewed as an essential and core program for preparing and developing Goddards managers as leaders for Goddards future success. The GLES program that Greystone designed and delivered is totally unique in the public, private, and academic sectors.	It focuses totally on leadership not on management and is integrated from beginning to end. Three critical areas bound the program - managing self as a leader, leading change and leading collaboratively. Eighteen modules have been designed to span 5 leadership focus areas: self-awareness and progressing through interpersonal competence, group leadership, organizational dynamics and environmental impacts. Each module has been constructed to integrate proprietary learning modalities into a whole that specifically addresses the unique nature of Goddards culture. It is a rigorous program that fully embodies the needs of the adult learner. Teaching modalities span a wide spectrum including action learning, assessment instruments, films, small group inquiry, reading and reflection, simulations, role-playing, group and individual exercises, journaling and personal coaching. Also unique are the extensive use of core learning teams throughout the course. Participants experience an intensive learning event that is profound enough to be transformative and pragmatic enough to immediately apply in their actual work environment. The course learning standard is one of trust and respect for all differences.  All subsequent learning occurs in the context of the participants leadership vision.   Each participant receives individualized learning and support in the form of coaching and program facilitation in recognition that successful leadership development involves both personal and organizational transformation. The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. expends considerable effort to remain current on developments in the Federal Government, NASA, and Goddard environments.  This enables Greystone to modify the program to reflect current areas of emphasis and concern while tailoring the content to the individual and collective needs of the participants. A key feature of the GLES design is class created projects that reflect the current issues and solutions that the participants feel are relevant to their daily work. Some 25 such projects have been created and presented by class participants to Goddards Executive Council. Given its lead role in integrating all leadership programs and in designing and implementing all of the first four new GLES programs, The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. possesses unique knowledge and expertise resulting in a minimal learning curve, thus requiring the expenditure of fewer hours and dollars.  Greystones integral involvement since the need for this program was first identified in 2003 provides The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. with a unique and comprehensive understanding of the program and the workshops to date.	This understanding is essential to ensuring that future workshops align with what has been taught and do not unnecessarily repeat content.  It cannot be underestimated how critically important this thread of learning is to participants of NASA and to their contribution as current and future leaders of the Center. GSFC is beginning the process of evaluating and possibly redesigning all of its leadership training programs. Any redesigns may result in a new requirement which may be competed.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organization may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on March 8, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely with the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit capability statements which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The proposed contractual action is for other than full and open competition based on 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description.  Request approval to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract to resellers of Thales equipment.  A firm-fixed price commercial item type contract is planned and will be issued pursuant to FAR 13.5.

5. Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications:

This equipment purchase is part of an ongoing MAJCOM-wide TCF Modernization Program and will be an extension of over one million dollars of  previously purchased and installed Thales encryption equipment.  Thales equipment is currently installed at Ramstein AB and projects are underway to install 6 units at Aviano AB and another two units at Spangdahlem AB.  Thales is required to ensure consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use, and interoperability.  This equipment is being installed into an existing SONET network.  Each brand of link encryption device has its own monitoring suite.  If another brand was used there would be the additional fifty seven thousand dollars for the USAFE Installations covered under this purchase for the cost of monitoring software and hardware, not including any installation costs.  Thales has its own monitoring suite at no additional cost.  It allows the USAFE Network Operations and Security Center and installation Tech Control facilities to use a single vendor provided application to manage all USAFE SONET Encryption equipment.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources

The synopsis will be combined with the solicitation in accordance with FAR part 12.
All responsive offerors will be considered.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price
	
The Contracting Officer will compete the requirement with resellers of Thales equipment to ensure prices are fair and reasonable.

8.  Description of Market Research 

The research that produced the overarching solution for the USAFE TCF Modernization Program included the evaluation of FIPS 140-2 technologies and equipment manufacturers.  This included Thales and SafeNet which are the only two FIPS 140-2 certified vendors.  The evaluation consisted of personal experiences of USAFE personnel, review of product documentation obtained from the web, vendor provided demonstrations and product documentation, review of currently fielded equipment, and GSA schedule and retail pricing lists.  Based on the evaluations, an equipment suite was chosen based on capabilities, integration, and price.  This solution included the selection of the Thales Datacryptor product line as the link encryption devices.

9.  Supporting Facts:

This brand name of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program and economy of resources across the USAFE Theater. 

10.  Listing of Interested sources: 

IPIntegration Inc, GS-35F-0740P, PO Box 28617, Santa Ana, Ca 92799, 714-557-5200, Small Business
Technica Corporation, NAS5-02149, 45245 Business Court, Suite 300, Dulles, VA 20166, 703-662-2000, Small Business

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition: 

USAFE CSS/SCML must remain with the Thales product line to ensure continuity, compatibility and consistency of existing equipment.  The Government would incur costs in training of personnel and reengineering of non-Thales equipment for integration with existing equipment as detailed above.  Competition is limited to multiple resellers of Thales equipment.    

12.  Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule

The Government anticipates a 30-day delivery period after contractor?s receipt of order

13.  Reference to Approved Acquisition Plan (AP)

<DESC>Solicitation Number S-WHARC-07-Q-0015
Questions and Answers, Round 2

Question #5: Are the trucks required to be manufactured in the U.S.?
Answer #5: No. The vehicles are not required to be manufactured in the U.S.

Question #6: Is the Ocean Vessel to La Paz, Bolivia required to be made on a U.S. flag vessel?
Answer #6: See FAR clause 52.247-64, Preference for Privately Owned U.S.-Flag Commercial Vessels, which is included in the solicitation.  The FAR can be accessed on the Internet at http://acquisition.gov/far/index.html.

Question #7: "Having zero miles" - The units we are offering will be from factory so they will be "new," but we may have to move the vehicles to our supplier to get the winches mounted - max approx. 15/20 miles total - would this low mileage be an issue?
Answer #7: A very few miles would not be an issue, provided that it can be clearly shown that the miles are directly related to preparing the vehicles for delivery under the contract.  The main point is that it must be clear that the vehicles are new from the factory, and that they were not used as demonstration vehicles or in any other capacity that is inconsistent with being classified as new vehicles.

Question #8: 4.2.19. lists door locks - do they want manual or power locks?
Answer #8: Manual locks are sufficient.

Question #9: Is this a small business set aside?
Answer #9: No. This is not a small business set-aside.

Question #10: Is there a specific manufacturer that is being considered because they already have vehicles in use by the Govt of Bolivia?
Answer #10: We are not mandating a specific manufacturer.  Any vehicle that meets the specifications included in the FedBizOpps notice may be quoted.
