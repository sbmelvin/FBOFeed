<CONTACT>Contracting Officer - Sheila Smith, Contract Specialist, Ph:(315) 425-4693, Fx:(315) 425-4843
<DESC>The VA Healthcare Network Upstate New York at Syracuse intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Medrad of Indianola, PA for the purchase and installation of one (1) Stellant D Dual Syringe CT Injection System.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302 – only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  NAICS Code 334510 applies and the size standard is 500 employees.  Medrad is classified as other than small business.  To the best of our knowledge, Medrad is the only company that offers a Saline Flush System when performing CT procedures while allowing for simultaneous injections of saline and contrasts.  This equipment also has a Pressure Monitor Graph feature which measures real time pressure at the syringe tip and an injector that can test inject while in the same protocol.  This injector is identical to the one provided as a component of the recently purchased Philips Brilliance 64 Channel CT Scanner and will provide an added benefit of standardization on one product for ease of use for technician training as well as for procuring disposables from a single vendor.  No solicitation document is available; however, any firm that believes it has a product that can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within ten (10) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance.   Information may be sent electronically to Sheila.Smith3@va.gov , by fax to (315) 425-4843, or by mail to:  Contracting Officer (2-90NCA), VA Medical Center, 800 Irving Avenue, Syracuse, NY 13210.   Any responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government as to whether to complete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses must be received by the due date specified in this notice to be considered.

<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS:  The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of system and subsystem level technologies that when integrated into the tactical environment provide revolutionary improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the military. The DARPA/TTO program will consider a broad range of technologies but focuses on the development and demonstration of complete systems or subsystems rather than basic sciences. Proposed systems and subsystems need not be composed entirely of newly developed components, but may integrate new technology into existing systems and/or subsystems.  AREAS OF INTEREST:  DARPA is the central research and development organization for the Department of Defense (DoD). It manages and directs selected basic and applied research and development projects for DoD, and pursues research and technology where risk and payoff are both very high and where success may provide dramatic advances for traditional military roles and missions.  DARPA/TTO focuses on technologies in the context of platforms and develops technologies that enable new system and platform functionality, such as autonomous and semiautonomous operations, controls, sensors, weapons, power, and propulsion. For specific examples of systems currently under development by TTO, see "Programs" at www.darpa.mil/tto/. Concepts for C3I, microfabrication, materials, or basic science may be of greater interest to one or more of the other DARPA Offices listed at www.darpa.mil. This BAA seeks new ideas, not necessarily extensions of the current programs.  TTO priorities fall within four primary focus areas: 1) Space, including: a) small, low-cost, high-performance satellites, b) rapid, flexible, low-cost launch, and c) operations in space, including space control and situational awareness; 2) Unmanned Vehicles, including: a) low-altitude operation - mobility and speed among natural and manmade obstacles, b) deployment and operation by lower echelons, c) reduced logistical and human burden,  d) weapons integration and release e) increased autonomy for enhanced manned/unmanned teaming, and  f) infantry support robots; 3) Tactical Multipliers, including: a) new vehicle and weapon concepts for ground, air, and sea , b) force protection (defensive and counterfire) against conventional weapons and WMD, c) technologies enabling higher-performance platforms and weapons; d) non-lethal anti-personnel weapons; e) ultra-precise, near-instantaneous power projection; f) situational awareness; and 4) Urban Warfare and Low Intensity Operations, including: a) decisive conflict and stable peacekeeping with minimal US casualties, b) rapid neutralization of combatants with minimal effect on non-combatants, and c) flexibility to rapidly adjust and compensate for new tactics and responses to US force structure; d) boundless urban access with minimal disruption; e) rapid control, stabilization, and pacification during military operations. Other novel ideas that enhance military effectiveness and particularly that tilt the balance of asymmetric warfare in favor of the US will also be considered.  PROGRAM SCOPE:  The Government plans to make $8.0M of FY 2005 funds available to fund projects under this BAA, though more may be made available. Multiple awards are anticipated from FY 2005 funds. For Government programmatic flexibility, offerors should segment their cost proposals into an initial 12-month (or shorter) phase which explores and validates the technical feasibility of the concept, and one or more phases proposed as optional efforts leading toward technology development. The total effort including options should not exceed five years. TTO typically provides $200K to $1000K for the initial phase. Successful initial phases will have a greater likelihood of receiving funding for subsequent optional phases.  This BAA solicits both white papers and proposals on proposed research. TTO will treat a white paper as an inquiry and will respond with a recommendation based on the likelihood of selection of a proposal. TTO will treat a proposal as an offer and will respond either by not selecting it for funding or selecting it for funding and negotiation by a Contracting Officer. White papers should be brief summaries; proposal should be more detailed and complete.  The submission of a white paper is optional, but recommended. It introduces the idea, solicits interaction with TTO, and avoids the expense of generating proposals that have little likelihood of selection within this BAA. The white paper should clearly articulate the innovative concept or technology development being proposed. Regardless of the TTO recommendation based on its review of the white paper, an offeror may submit a proposal and that proposal will be reviewed and evaluated. Favorable response to a white paper is not an assurance that a full proposal on the white paper's topic will ultimately be selected for contract award.  OFFERORS:  Teaming is encouraged. An offeror may submit more than one proposal. Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside because of the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in innovative tactical technology. Proposals from US government entities, FFRDCs, and other offerors who are proposing additional work under existing task order contracts will not be considered part of this BAA but may be evaluated by TTO separately from the BAA proposals.  SCHEDULE:  TTO will conduct an initial round of proposal receipt, evaluation, selection, and award. For the initial round of source selection, white papers should be submitted to TTO no later than 03-30-05. In order to be considered for an award during this first round, proposals must be received by TTO no later than 6-22-05.  White papers received after 1600 local time 12/8/05 will not be evaluated under this BAA. The BAA will remain open for proposals through 1600 local time on the closing date, 2/16/06. Proposals received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated.  TTO will endeavor to respond to each white paper within forty-five (45) days after its receipt. As soon as the evaluation of a proposal is completed, the offeror will be notified that 1) the proposal has been selected for funding pending contract negotiations, or 2) the proposal has not been selected. One copy of each non-selected proposal will be retained for the files. Any additional copies of non-selected proposals will be destroyed upon non-selection.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a review using the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1) Overall scientific and technical merit including degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational issues, and experimental approach. 2) Potential contribution to TTO mission, including the likelihood of transition to the military if technically successful. 3) Offeror's capabilities and related experience, including qualifications and achievements of all team members and their key personnel, their capability to carry out further development and production, and the adequacy of facilities and equipment to be used for the proposed effort. 4) Project plan. 5) Cost realism.  HUMAN USE IN RESEARCH:  Proposals selected for funding are required to comply with provisions of the Common Rule (32 CFR 219) on the protection of human subjects in research (www.dtic.mil/biosys/downloads/32cfr219.pdf) and the Department of Defense Directive 3216.2 (www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html2/d32162x.htm). All proposals that involve the use of human subjects are required to include documentation of their ability to follow Federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects.  This includes, but is not limited to, protocol approval mechanisms, approved Institutional Review Boards, and Federal Wide Assurances. These requirements are based on expected human use issues sometime during  the entire length of the proposed effort.  For proposals involving "greater than minimal risk" to human subjects within the first year of the project, performers must provide evidence of protocol submission to a federally approved IRB at the time of proposal submission to DARPA. For proposals that are forecasted to involve "greater than minimal risk" after the first year, a discussion on how and when the proposer will comply with submission to a federally approved IRB needs to be provided in the submission. More information on applicable federal regulations can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services - Office of Human Research Protections website (www.dhhs.gov/ohrp/).

THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center (COAC) for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) www.niams.nih.gov, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 37) http://www.acqnet.gov/far, on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Bioinformatics Services, 12114 Gatewater Drive, Rockville, MD, to serve as a expert Kinetic Analysis, for experimental data obtained using the confocal microscopy and video imaging. Duties: The contractor shall 1) provide a comprehensive kinetic analysis of confocal microscopy data, generated by clinical investigators. The analysis requires the use of proprietary software generated by the company and consists of testing mechanistic theories formulated as models, based on standard principles of chemical kinetics. 2) the company will conduct weekly with the investigators on the biological details of the data and the outcome, and will consult weekly with investigators on the biological details of the data and the outcome of the modeling. 3) provide a model that accounts for the observations made by the investigators. This model will be empirically tested by the investigators, and if discrepancies were to be found, the process is reinitiated until a final model that accounts for all observations are finally generated. NIAMS wishes to retain the professional consulting services of Dr. Robert Phair, senior consultant with Bioinformatics Services. Bioinformatics Services offers a unique combination of experimental and computation experience unavailable elsewhere. Dr. Phair is well known to the NIH research community. He has worked with Dr. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) for more than 6 years and has another long term working relationship with Dr. Tom Mistell, National Cancer Institute (NCI). In addition, Dr. Phair has worked for shorter periods with many other labs at NIH and he is a regular participant in two NIH interest groups. Dr. Phair knows the NIH community well, having worked at the campus from 1970 to 1973, and has taught a popular course on integrated bioinfomatics in the NIH Foundation for Advancement Education in Sciences (FAES) graduate program. He is a former professor of Biomedical Engineering at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and is internationally known in the fields of cell biological modeling and systems biology software development. Dr. Phair’s work with Drs. Misteli and Dr. Lippincott-Schwartz, has resulted in a number of high-profile publications,  including papers on nature, science, and cell biology. There is also a seminal review of kinetic approaches to invivo imaging that he co-authored with Dr. Misteli, which appeared in Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology. Dr. Phair is clearly at the cutting edge of computational cell biology, as demonstrated by his being supported by an NIH Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant, to develop (with business partners), a software product called ProcessDB, that aim is to put modeling tools on the desktops of working cell biologists. Bioinformatics Services offers kinetic modeling and scientific consulting services at the very highest level of both biological and computational expertise, making this combination of skills hard to duplicate.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Fogarty International Center (FIC), has a requirement to procure, on a sole source basis, the services from Flacso, Ayacucho 551 (1026) Ciudad DE, Buenos Aires, Argentina, which will provide to FIC Phase 2 of a continuing project.  Phase 2 will develop “Virtual Program for Career Development and Capacity Building for Latin American and Caribbean Junior Women Scientists”.  The project will be based upon a series of interrelated training, mentoring and networking and capacity building activities delivered on a virtual platform co-directed by FOGARTY Program Director for Latin America and the Caribbean and the UNESCO Regional Chair Director and with the participation of experts in science and gender related programs.

Its main purpose is to create a high quality, flexible and interactive virtual learning and exchange environment that may offer LAC junior women involved in scientific projects:

•	Mentoring relations with senior specialists in this field in order to enhance their skills and capacities for career development, networking and leadership in their disciplines and institutions.

•	Educational resources to encourage the integration of gender concepts and analysis in scientific research.

•	Exchange, information and support for the creation of national, regional or international communities of practice working in science projects.

•	Information and communication resources for different sectors involved in science projects in Latin America (researchers, institutions, NGOs, etc.). 

The design of this program will take advantage of the academic and technical expertise in using ICTs for educational and networking activities of both FOGARTY and UNESCO Chair. In particular, it will explore the potential of “E-lluminate”, a Web conferencing and e-learning software currently used by FOGARTY, and the technological and pedagogical expertise of UNESCO Chair in producing and conducting e-learning programs on gender and science issues. 

It will integrate three virtual activities simultaneously or successive performed: training, mentoring and networking and institutional capacity building.

TRAINING 

A1) Workshop on Career Development

The contents and pedagogical strategies will be elaborated by a team of US and Latin American experts on this field based on the evaluation results of:


“Leadership and Career Development Workshop for Women Scientists in the Developing World” with women Fogarty GRIP grantees (May 30 to June 1, 2005)
A Consultation of a Draft Curriculum

Using creative and highly interactive tools, this workshop will include several activities in order to develop skills for:
•	strategic planning, 
•	communication, 
•	leadership, 
•	problem solving and negotiation, 
•	networking,
•	collaborative projects.

     
A2) Series of video/audio lectures on cutting-edge research topics in selected areas of scientific research (3 to 5 lectures throughout a 7-month period).

Those areas will be selected among priorities previously identified with GRIP researchers and consultations with LAC institutions.

Prestigious international scholars and researchers from different countries and disciplines will be invited to give a lecture, followed by a discussion with participants. 

A3) Virtual forums (4 to 8 forums throughout a 7-month period) moderated by specialized tutors will be implemented for different purposes:

•	Preparation of participants for active participation in the discussions following the lectures.

•	Evaluation of the results of the lectures and their impact on their professional disciplines.

•	Discussion of previously identified controversial issues.

•	Sharing knowledge and information, etc.

•	Networking

Forums will be developed at scheduled dates and times (each of them will entail synchronic and asynchronic activities). The forum dynamics will be based on guidelines and proven methodologies. 
 
A4) Seminar “Gender Perspectives in Biomedical Research”
 
It will cover information about the latest developments in theory, methodology and impact on policy-making regarding international science projects based on gender concepts and gender analysis. It will encourage participants to ponder on the new knowledge that is being built on the basis of this perspective and its significance for their own field of work. Case studies, simulations and other challenging and interactive resources will be prepared to stimulate participants to explore the integration of gender issues and perspectives in their own projects.


MENTORING 

A group of women and men senior scientists will be identified and trained to be mentors of junior women scientists from LAC.

This activity will be planned according to the following definitions and objectives:

“Mentoring implies assisting, supporting, encouraging, guiding, modeling, challenging, and coaching. It is an intense, trust-building, supportive, positive and networking activity geared to make mistakes, gain feedback, accept challenges, and learn from each other (Sweeny, 2002). A central quality of mentoring is that it is intentional, nurturing, insightful, and supportive”.

While the concept of mentoring has a long history, the virtual mentoring phenomenon started around 1995. The International Telementor Program (ITP) began in 1995 to facilitate electronic mentoring relationships worldwide between professional adults and students. Since 1995, with the ever-growing use of the Internet and electronic mail, virtual mentoring programs have developed into a variety of areas including education and business. Information technology enables mentoring relationships to occur and flourish where geography, time or financial constraints would otherwise prevent them. 

Our aim is to prepare a mentoring program whereby mentors and small groups of mentorees would meet at scheduled times, to achieve specific goals related to career
development, aspirations and contributions to scientific research and programs in LAC within set timeframes.  

It will also include informal meetings between mentors and mentorees, either on a person-to-person basis or in small groups to deal with shared needs or goals.

Mentoring relationships will pay special attention to:

•	The specific problems and hindrances women face in their scientific career development to balance family, personal and professional needs, reach leadership positions and deal with gender bias in institutional cultures.

•	Discussion of personal and collective strategies to overcome such hindrances.

•	Envisioning and experimenting innovations aimed at creating gender-sensitive work environments.

•	Providing access to a wide range of information and contacts associated with the mentorees’ field of work.

•	Supporting critical stages in women’s professional career such as return to their home countries, pregnancy and early child rearing, etc. 

•	Designing creative pedagogical tools to increase motivation, fluent and confident exchange, planning and evaluation of goals.


NETWORKING AND INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING

The creation of networks and regional or international communities of practice composed of junior and senior women in science projects in LAC will be encouraged along all the stages of the program. Some of the activities to be developed include the presentation of the program at USA and LAC Scientific Institutions, and at scientific events such as conferences, congresses and workshops.

The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The purpose of this contract is for software development services to support the maturation and transition of the AMRFC core infrastructural software to the MFEW Advanced Demonstration Model (ADM) currently being developed to be delivered to the Navy in 2007.  Through market research, NRL has concluded that Coherent Systems International Corporation is the only company that can provide this service which is not expected to be recovered through competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's needs. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Metal Technology Inc.,  173 Queen Ave. S.E., Albany OR  for the purchase of vanadium sample cans to be used in neutron scattering powder diffraction experiments. 

The NIST Center for Neutron Research performs a large number of neutron scattering experiments. One of the most frequent types of experiment performed is a powder diffraction experiment. These power diffraction experiments frequently utilize vanadium sample cans. 

Sole source determination is based on the need for the deep drawn character of the tubes ability to decrease unwanted background scattering.  This is critical because neutron scattering samples are typically small but expensive and/or time-intensive to produce. The sample can will contain a potentially radioactive powder. The supplier of these sample cans must have the ability to produce the deep drawn vanadium tubes, electro-welded to titanium flanges, with a proven degree of reliability.  Metal Technology is the only known vendor capable of providing the required vanadium can assembly.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 331491, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider responses received by April 24, 2006.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposal acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This modification provides answers to additional questions asked regarding the NYAIC Modernization effort.

1)The specifications state that the subbase fuel tank shall have the same dimensions as the base of the generator. This is a problem because of the running time requested (96 hours). UL listed subbase tanks have maximum height limitations that will be contradictory the gallonage required.
Response:
Provide  a subbase tank for 1200 gallons not exceeding the following dimensions 165 inches X 76 inches X 36 inches

2)I saw the clarification giving the size of the loadbank but there was no detailed specification(i.e. Is the loadbank to be freestanding NEMA 3R or duct mounted within the generator enclosure.)
Response:
Provide radiator mounted load bank.

3)The drawings indicate the standard automatic transfer switches while the specifications indicate that they are bypass isolation type. Please clarify.
Response:
Provide standard automatic transfer switch.

4)The specifications call for a hospital grade silencer as well as a weather enclosure. A hospital grade silencer is typically specified when noise is  a concern. In this case providing a hospital grade silencer will not provide any benefit as the engine noise will be louder than that of a critical silencer.
Response:
Provide critcal grade silencer with 1.5 inches sound attentuation
insulation on the weatherproof enclosure.

5.  Are there liquidated damages for this contract?
Response:  There are no liquidated damages.

3.     Changes to the solicitation.  See Amendment 0002 for the changes.

SYNOPSIS FOR SOLICITATION DG1350-06-RP-0029


The Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Office of Travel and Tourism requires contractor services for the development and support of a process to administer a monthly In-Flight Survey of International Travelers. Competed in accordance with FAR Part 15. This survey will provide statistical market data about the international air passenger travel market.  This is a pre-solicitation notice.

The data collected by this survey reflects the characteristics of the international travel population, with the collections proportionately coming from markets for inbound travel as well as destinations visited by U.S. travelers abroad.  This survey is the sole source for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates for travel and passenger fare exports and imports, as well as multiple other Federal and private sector industry clients.  Quarterly estimates are produced from the survey based on reporting of monthly samples. By distributing the sample throughout each month of the quarter, the seasonal variances in travel patterns are reflected in the survey.  Due to the seasonal travel patterns of international travelers, the third quarter tends to be the largest survey period.  

This acquisition is set aside exclusively for small business concerns under authority of Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.203.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541910 and the related size standard is $6.0 million.  A solicitation will be posted to this Government wide point of entry on or about Tuesday, 21 February, 2006.  The Government estimates a fixed price contract to be awarded based on competition for one twelve month period and four twelve month option periods.  The estimated level of effort based on historical experience is 70,000-95,000 respondents per year.  There is considerable demand for a much larger sample, and potential contractors will be encouraged to develop strategies and methods to increase the sample of the program given financial constraints due to funding available.  

The Government foresees holding a pre-proposal conference for this acquisition approximately mid-March, during which potential contractors may obtain better understanding of the work required.  Further details relating to date, time, and location will be included in the solicitation.  Further information on the In-Flight Survey program can be found at the OTTI website: http://tinet.ita.doc.gov/research/programs/ifs/index.html

<CONTACT>Scott Starkman, Contracting Officer, Phone (212) 264-2759, Fax (212) 264-4808, Email scott.starkman@gsa.gov
<DESC>IF YOU RESPONDED TO A PREVIOUS NOTICE FOR THIS PROJECT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Provide all labor, material, supervision, equipment, and tools necessary to perform general repairs and alterations (mostly interior) in Federally-owned buildings and Federally-leased space within the five (5) boroughs of New York City, and in the New York State counties of Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester.  This is a multiple-award, Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts solicitation, and the offeror shall have the ability to perform construction projects (on an as-needed basis) ranging in dollar value from $2,000.00 to $2,410,000.00 (GSA Prospectus Level).  Several projects may be performed concurrently and multiple subcontracting may be involved.  The offeror may also be required to furnish design (architect & engineer) services on selected projects.  The offeror will be required to serve as the General Contractor and will therefore be responsible for the work of all trades involved on the projects performed under this contract.  The estimated cost of construction under these contracts is approximately $10 million to $12 million per year (for all contractors); up to $6 million may be awarded per year to each contractor.  There will be a guaranteed minimum quantity of work the Government agrees to order per year from each contractor.  This procurement will be a total small business set aside.  To be considered a small business, the concern’s average annual receipts for the preceding three (3) fiscal years may not exceed $31 million (under NAICS 236220).  There will, in addition, be partial set asides to 8(a) concerns, HUBZone small business concerns, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business concerns.  The Government may make multiple awards and intends to award seven (7) contracts under this solicitation -- one reserved for 8(a), one reserved for HUBZone small business, and one reserved for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business, under each of their respective partial set-asides.  The remaining four (4) contracts may be awarded to any small business concern.  Therefore, all small business concerns will be eligible to bid on this solicitation.  This will be a negotiated procurement, using the lowest-price, technically acceptable method.    Individual task orders exceeding $2,000.00 will be competed amongst the contract awardees unless the Government deems otherwise on an individual task order basis.  Non-price evaluation factors (e.g., past performance) may be considered in addition to price in determining the placement of orders.  These contracts will be for a one-year base period with four (4) one-year option periods to be exercised at the Government’s discretion.  It is anticipated that the contracts will commence on or about September 1, 2006.  A bid guarantee will be required (except from eligible 8(a) concerns). The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220.  Firms interested in receiving a solicitation package, please send a written request, no later than the close of business on Friday, April 28, 2006, to the attention of: Mr. Jonathan Phillips, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Federal Center Service Center (2PMC-F), 26 Federal Plaza, Room 16-124, New York, NY 10278 or by facsimile to (212) 264-4808.  Please no phone or e-mail requests.  The solicitation will be available on or about May 1, 2006 with a closing date expected on or about June 1, 2006.  There will be no public opening of offers.  ATTENTION PROSPECTIVE SUBCONTRACTORS:  If you are interested in serving as a potential subcontractor to the General Contractors bidding on this solicitation and you wish to have your company information included in the solicitation, for marketing purposes, please submit your company name, address, phone number, contact person, e-mail address, and area(s) of specialization (e.g., electrical, carpentry, plumbing) by electronic mail to scott.starkman@gsa.gov (type “Subcontractor Info” as the Subject) by the close of business on Friday, April 28, 2006.  Questions regarding this announcement may be directed to Jonathan Phillips, Contracting Officer, at (212) 264-2818, or to Scott Starkman, Contracting Team Leader, at (212) 264-2759.  If you responded to a previous notice for this project, you do not need to respond to this announcement.

<DESC>NOTE: THIS CHANGE IS FOR THE NAICS CODE.  ONLY ONE NAICS CODE WILL APPLY TO THE SOLICITATION.  NAICS CODE 236220 APPLIES.  SYNOPSIS IS MODIFIED AS SHOWN BELOW:

This procurement is for one solicitation, structured as a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) for General Construction resulting in the award of three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts for a base year and three Option years.  Each contract shall be awarded with a minimum guarantee of $50,000 applicable to the base year of the contract only .  The total not-to-exceed value for all four years (Base, plus three Options) of each of the three contracts is $11,250,000.00.  The total 4 year (base year and three option years) estimated construction costs for all three IDIQ contracts is not-to-exceed $45,000,000.

After award of the initial contracts, the three successful offerors will compete for task orders based on using one of these three processes:  Best Value to the Government using trade off processes, or Low Price, or  Low Price Technically Acceptable. The Government will provide full plans and specifications for each task order or detailed shop drawings and a statement of work. The estimated dollar range of task orders to be issued is $25,000 - $3,000,000. The work will consist of General Construction projects falling under NAICS Code 236220.  The size standard is $31,000,000.00.  The Government reserves the right to award one of the contracts to a qualified 8(a) firm, 
provided an acceptable proposal is submitted, price and technical factors considered. The remaining two contracts will be made to the firms considered to be the Best Value and will be competed UNRESTRICTED.  If sufficient qualified 8(a) firms apply and are considered “Best Value”, it is possible that more than one contract will be awarded to 8(a) firms.  We will utilize two-step, Source Selection Procedures for this procurement. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and the use of a trade-off process when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror(s) or other than the highest technically rated offeror(s).  Phase 1 of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to select approximately five – seven offerors based on factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Scheduling, and Small Business Subcontracting Effort.  Phase I factors relate to the base year and each of the three option year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including administrative, training, family housing, dormitory, and community support type facilities, not just the seed project identified in Section 00202 of the RFP.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit additional information on Factor B (Technical) pertinent to the seed project and price proposals for that project.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE FULL SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED IN APPROXIMATELY 30-45 DAYS AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD AT THE NAVFAC WEBSITE, URL ADDRESS:  WWW.ESOL.NAVFAC.NAVY.MIL

<DESC>NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED BY TELEPHONE. ALL QUESTIONS AND RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MUST BE SUBMITTED TO budgetfe@gsa.gov.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. NO PURCHASE WILL RESULT FROM THIS ACTION. 
This is a summary of the Request for Information – Budgeting, Formulation and Execution Initiative. The complete document, containing Background, Instructions and the Questionnaire is attached to this page, and also available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/egov/c-6-7-bfe.html. 
The General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy, in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), seeks information related to Federal-wide Budgeting, Formulation, and Execution (BF&E) capabilities. The objective is to identify opportunities for common solutions, automated tools, and other approaches, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal agency and central budget processes. The establishment of the BF&E Line of Business (LoB) will result in a more coordinated approach to producing the Federal Budget, improving the integration and standardized exchange of budgeting data,  improving capabilities for analyzing budgeting data, and enhancing budget and performance integration.  The LoB will also ensure sustainable participation from Federal partners to establish a collaborative model for BF&E-related activities and investments that promotes optimization, and enhances the effectiveness of the Federal budgeting workforce. 
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information for Solicitation and Planning Purposes (October 1997), this notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). The BF&E LoB Task Force intends to assess the responses to inform its decision-making. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to contract for services. The government will not pay for any information provided as a result of this notice and will not recognize or reimburse any cost associated with RFI submission. Responses to this RFI will not affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any RFP that might follow. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such and the government will ensure this information is not released externally. The overarching objective of this RFI is information gathering and not development of possible government acquisition of products or services. 
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. NO PURCHASE WILL RESULT FROM THIS ACTION.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR INFORMATION ONLY FROM ALL TYPES OF SMALL BUSINESSES (SB, SDB, SDVOSB, Woman-Owned SB, etc.).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710.  RESPONSES ARE DUE, Close of Business, May 8, 2006. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS INFORMATION REQUEST.   NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST, OR ANY SUBSEQUENT FOLLOW-UP REQUESTS.   NO TELEPHONE CALLS REQUESTING A SOLICITATION WILL BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.   RESPONSES SHALL NOT EXCEED 20 PAGES AND STANDARD COMPANY BROCHURES ARE NOT DESIRED. INFORMATION SHALL FOCUS ON THE CAPABILITY TO PROVIDE LABORATORY SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL SERVICES AS DEFINED BELOW.   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a market survey to identify small businesses that have technical capabilities that can support the National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) in the Office of Research and Development (ORD).  Specifically, the EPA is conducting a market survey to determine the potential for small businesses to perform the services defined in this synopsis and in the draft Statements of Work, which have been posted at the following EPA website: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adm_placement/prhq0614395/prhq0614395.htm.   THIS SYNOPSIS represents the research laboratory services requirement previously published under SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS PR-NC-06-10151, entitled "HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING (HTS) AND TOXICOGENOMIC SERVICES."  BACKGROUND: EPA/ORD established the NCCT in 2005 to research the utility of computational chemistry, high-throughput screening (HTS) and various toxicogenomic technologies for Agency use in chemical prioritization, quantitative risk assessment and biological modeling.  As part of this, the NCCT is developing computational tools for interpreting data from these technologies to classify chemicals, predict toxicity, and prioritize limited testing resources towards chemicals and endpoints that present the greatest risk to human health and the environment.  Thus a chemical prioritization research program, entitled ToxCast, is being initiated with the purpose of developing the ability to predict, or forecast toxicity.  The proof-of-concept phase of ToxCast will focus upon chemicals with a rich toxicological database (e.g., registered pesticide actives), in order to provide an interpretive context.   Following this proof-of-concept, the ToxCast program will move on to other environmental chemicals domains relevant to EPA.  The ToxCast program will evaluate chemical properties and effects across a broad spectrum of information domains: physical-chemical properties, predicted biological activities based on existing structure-activity models, biochemical properties based on HTS assays, cell based phenotypic assays, and genomic and metabolomic analyses of cells.   SCOPE: Much of the data in these various domains will be generated through a series of eight integrated Performance Work Statements (PWS).  The contracts awarded relative to these PWS will be essential components of the ToxCast program over the next five years, providing data populating the various domains that can be interpretively linked to known or predicted toxicological properties of environmental chemicals.  Thus the structured strategy developed within ToxCast to classify chemicals, identify or predict potential toxicities and pathways, and to prioritize chemicals for subsequent testing will be dependent on the data and resources available through these contracts.   Small businesses with the capability of providing these services are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information within the page limitation (20 pages) which demonstrates their ability to perform this type of work. Responses, including the vendor?s business status (e.g.:  small, small disadvantaged, minority-owned, 8(a), SDVOSB, etc.) should be sent electronically to the Contracting Officer, John J. Nanartowicz III, at the following e-mail address? nanartowicz.john@epa.gov.   If vendors so desire, hardcopy information supplementing the electronic submission can be sent to the following address: U.S. EPA; ATTN.: Sue Davis (Mail Drop D-305-01), Research Triangle Park, N.C., 27711.  COURIER/OVERNIGHT CARRIER ADDRESS: U.S. EPA; ATTN.: Sue Davis (Mail Drop D-305-01); 4930 Old Page Road Durham, NC   27703.  Capability statements shall be submitted no later than May 8, 2006.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV requires laboratory and field evaluation of a physiologically based sampling pump for assessing a worker’s exposure to chemicals at the work place.  

NIOSH is interested in a new paradigm for exposure assessment.  Exposures are traditionally measured by drawing air through a filter medium at a constant rate over a work-day.  However, workers do not breathe at the same rate all day.  If maxima in the beathing rate correlate with maxima in the exposure profile, exposures may be seriously underestimated.  A physoilogic sampling pump (PSP) is under development at NIOSH, which will alter its flow-rate according to physiolgoical inputs.  

Phase I was announced and advertised.  It consisted of the following objectives
A.	Evaluation of LifeShirt hardware / software capabilities 
B.	Initial laboratory evaluation of LifeShirt performance 
1.	PSU and NIOSH IRB approval to be obtained
2.	LifeShirt system output parameters and ventilation rates recorded for different subjects, activities
C.	Development of protocol/algorithms for estimating ventilation rate 
1.	Ventilation rates to be recorded for 4-6 subjects simulating construction work activities representing a realistic range of work-rates
2.	Modeling of ventilation rate as function of HR, physical characteristics, LifeShirt output
a.	Examination of traditional statistical based regression techniques Vs. neural networks for modeling ventilation rates
3.	Examination of individual versus group calibration methods
D.	Preparation for comparison of LifeShirt system-based estimation of ventilation rates to existing models in FY 07, to include actual ventilation rates measured for range of work activities and compared to predicted rates from LifeShirt- and HR-based models
Phase II: Laboratory Evaluation of PSP system
Approximately 20-30 subjects representing the demographics of the construction industries will be involved. These subjects will be selected so as to have similar ventilation rates to those subjects already characterized in Phase I, task C. Subjects will be asked to wear the PSP system, traditional sampling pump (TSP) system and a photoionization detector (PID).  Each subject will be exposed to ethyl benzene concentration in a chamber (1.5m x 1.5m x 2.3m) built in a laboratory and asked to perform exercise or rest according to the designated work-rest regimen.  A typical regimen would consist of six, ten-minute periods over which a subject alternates between stepping at rates of 10, 15, or 20 steps/min, and resting.  Also, each subject will be asked to hold a paint brush or roller and raise his/her arm each time the subject performs stepping exercise.  At the end of experiment, charcoal tubes connected to the upstream of PSP and TSP will be removed and sent to the NIOSH contract laboratory for analysis. Expected data will be ethyl benzene concentrations from PSP and TSP systems, personal exposures from a PID, chamber concentrations from a PID, and descriptive data (minimum, maximum, and average volume of sampled air) from physiologic pump. Each subject will repeat the same experiment at least twice. The data will be correlated with ventilation and heart-rate model developed in Phase I, task D.

Phase III: Field Evaluation of PSP System
This field study will consist of recruitment of approximately 10 subjects, from the pool considered in Phase II, to undergo monitoring during actual painting and sealing tasks.  In addition to obtaining ethyl benzene exposure, toluene and xylene will be measured because these are major constituents of solvent-based paints.  As well as subjects in Phase II, subjects in this phase will be asked to wear PSP, TSP, and PID monitor and to perform regular work for a full-day work shift.  At the end of the workday, sampled charcoal tubes will be sent to the NIOSH contract laboratory for analysis.  Expected data in this test will be time-weighted average concentrations of ethyl benzene, toluene and xylene, personal exposures from a PID, and descriptive data (minimum, maximum, and average volume of sampled air) from physiologic pump.  Each subject will be involved at least twice in the field evaluation. 

The Government intents to negotiate Phases II & III,  on a sole-source basis with Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania.    Changing laboratories at this time could lead to compromise of the data due to inter-laboratory variations.  

This notice is issued for informational purposes only.  Any interested party may identify themselves to the contracting officer no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Submit information to Rebecca Mullenax, Reference: 000HCC34-2006-30783, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH/ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any sources exist, therefore, no solicitation will be issued.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received within 15 days, award will be made to Pennsylvania State University.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>Architect-Engineering Services (A&E Services) are required for the production of specific Bio and Agro Defense Planning Services/Feasibility Study and the resultant design of the National Bio and Agro Defense Facility (NBAF) at a location yet to be determined. The proposed NBAF is an integrated human, foreign animal, and zoonotic disease research, development and testing facility that will allow for research to enhance agricultural and public health. The proposed NBAF would replace the existing Plum Island (PIDAC) facility and enhance capabilities to meet the mandated national and bio and agro-defense mission requirements of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA.) The estimated total cost for the project is approximately $451,000,000, including design and construction. This is a Request for Qualifications of A&E firms interested in contracting for this work. A&E firm, as used in this synopsis, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project concept and design documents. The scope of the A&E services required under this proposed contract includes, but is not limited to, the following: Prepare a planning document/feasibility study to include the basic requirements and information needed to procure, plan, design and construct the NBAF; Prepare design documents for the NBAF facility through concepts, design development and construction documentation. The design A&E may also provide inspection services and shop drawing review during the construction of the project. The DHS has identified the need to establish an integrated research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) infrastructure for combating bio and agro terrorism threats. The NBAF will enable DHS to fulfill its mission of detecting, preventing, protecting against and responding to bioterrorist attacks within the United States. The basic requirements and information needed to procure, plan, design and construct the NBAF shall be identified and documented in the planning document/feasibility study. The Planning document shall contain, at a minimum, the following information: Develop and document a summary of information on the program, and functions of the NBAF, including a statement of how NBAF requirements were developed; develop and document background and historical information, including information on the mission and functions of the Programs to be located in the NBAF; develop and document a summary describing the functional and space requirements of the NBAF for laboratory, office and support functions; develop and document functional and space requirements for animal, insectory, incineration and other functions. Program requirements shall include typical space definitions and criteria. The criteria for each type of function shall be specified, including architectural features such as floors, walls, ceilings, illumination, electrical power and mechanical requirements. Space requirements shall include a chart indicating by function or other definitive nomenclature the net area, the occupying organizational unit and staff, and specific architectural, environmental, and utility needs. Include the net area for each major function that will occupy the NBAF and develop estimates of the gross area needed to support the required net area. Develop and document a phasing, move and backfill strategy for all of the Programs and facility components. The NBAF project will integrate those aspects of public and animal health research that have been determined to be central to national security; meet the related and synergistic homeland defense RDT&E responsibilities by: providing essential animal model test and evaluation capacity to support licensure of vaccine countermeasures; providing a unique biosafety level (BSL3/Ag and BSL4) livestock capable laboratory for developing countermeasures for foreign animal diseases; and providing advanced test and evaluation capability for threat detection, vulnerability and countermeasure assessment for animal and zoonotic diseases. The proposed 520,000 square foot building must provide modern, safe and secure biocontainment laboratories of sufficient capacity to provide animal testing capability needed for the licensure of the human disease vaccines; defend against high-consequence human and foreign animal diseases in livestock; and provide the essential DHS infrastructure requirements for threat characterization, forensics, and detection. The co-location of human and agricultural Biodefense efforts will create an integrated and comprehensive system to rapidly recognize and characterize biological agents in human and animal populations, food, water, agriculture, and the environment. Since the U. S. is lacking in such critical national capability, acquiring an operational facility as soon as possible is of high priority. This procurement is unrestricted. The purpose of this procurement is to select a highly qualified A&E Services firm with demonstrated experience planning facilities and the design of level 2, 3, 3Ag & 4 laboratories and vivarium and associated support spaces, or similar facilities. This contract will be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6. The A&E Services firm will be selected in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in this synopsis, the evaluation criteria in FAR Section 36.602-1, through review of Standard Form (SF) 330’s and subsequent interviews. The top ranked A&E Services firm will be sent a Request for Proposal based on demonstrated competence and the unique qualifications for the required work. After receipt of the firm’s proposal, negotiations will proceed. A single firm-fixed price contract will be negotiated with separate line items for the Planning Services/Feasibility Study and Design. Only the Feasibility Study will be awarded initially; the Design of the new facility will be awarded by modification after completion of the Feasibility Study and Environmental Impact Study (EIS). The EIS will be performed under a separate contract. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The Small Business Subcontracting Goal for Fiscal Year 2006 is 40%, which includes the following: Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) – 8%; Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB) – 7%; HUBZone Small Business – 3%; Small Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) – 3%. The plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations. The Government intends to utilize a Construction Manager at Risk or Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Contract procedure for this requirement. Two contracts will ultimately be awarded: one to the A&E Services firm selected as a result of this notice; the other to a construction firm. Under this concept, the CMc functions as a collaborative member of the project team. The CMc will be responsible for all construction under a single contract and also provides expertise during the design process for the Government by checking estimates and performing constructability reviews. It is anticipated that award of the CMc contract will follow closely behind the award of the A&E Services design contract so that the CMc can provide preconstruction services during the design phase. At a pre-determined point in the design phase (likely at 70% design), the CMc offers a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) and construction of the project will begin, before design completion. Actual construction is estimated to commence about 15 months after design begins and be completed within approximately 42 months, including commissioning. SELECTION CRITERIA: In addition to the evaluation criteria in FAR Section 36.602-1, the following criteria will be used in the selection of the A-E firm: (1) Firms will be evaluated in terms of their relevant experience, including relevant experience of staff members, specifically for planning services, outlining the basic requirements and information needed to procure, plan, design and construct the NBAF. (2) Firms will be evaluated in terms of their relevant experience, including relevant experience of staff members, specifically on design work required by this procurement. Responsive firms will list all projects completed in the last ten years, which are of similar nature and scope as described herein, particularly the firm’s ability/past experience in working with CMc’s and the Guaranteed Maximum Price process. The list shall include project name, project location, project scope and current contract information. (3) Responsive firms will provide a list of key personnel, including subcontractors, proposed to work on this contract, and will indicate the percentage of total work the prime contractor expects to complete with its own work force. (4) Firms shall document each person’s role in preparing construction documents. (5) Demonstrate knowledge of codes, laws, permits and construction materials and practices. (6) Provide information on past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules and current Federal directives for sustainable design. (7) Demonstrate knowledge of environmental conditions/issues to include wetlands, water tables, flood planes, weather/climate conditions, coastal conditions, ecological concerns, and historical/archeological issues. (8) provide information on the firm’s quality control program which the firm uses to ensure (a) technical accuracy, (b) discipline coordination, including cross-discipline design checks, (c) ability to monitor time, (d) costs are kept within assigned limits, (e) quality of design, and (f) coordination and oversight of subcontractors/consultants. No solicitation package is available. Interested firms having the capabilities for this work are invited to submit original and six (6) copies of SF 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, to the Contracting Office listed above, Attn: Danny T. Hager, Contracting Officer. The SF 330 may be expanded, if necessary, to address the selection criteria fully. A completed SF 330 shall be submitted for each proposed key consultant. All submittals are due no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time May 31, 2006. Interested firms are invited to attend a pre-submittal conference at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Bldg 90, Brunswick (Glynco), Georgia, on April 27, 2006, at 9:00 AM.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.   Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.   Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.   In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.   The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).   Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held? 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.     
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.     
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR ELECTRONIC CYLINDER LIFTING SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions asked before the due date. 1. Question: Will Parker brand electric cylinders and motors be accepted if load and performance criteria is met?  Answer: Yes 2. Question: We will use cylinder type proximity switches for travel limits and home position.  Is this acceptable?	We typically use 24 VDC with NPN transistor output switches.  Is that acceptable?  Answer: As for determination of the applicablility of the proposed cylinder type proximity switches for travel limits and home position and the use of a certain voltage and output switch type, the system has been specified to meet prescribed  performance criteria. It is not part of the specifications to dictate exactly how those criteria are met. Objective evidence of compliance of the performance criteria is what is required. 3. Question:  Part of the specification calls for the system to re-adjust, realign and resynchronize the four matched sets of servo motors and electric cylinders if the chamber dome level attitude is ever violated.  We can provide a "synchronize" button on the operator panel to perform that function provided power to the encoders is maintained.  We typically provide a "background" 24 VDC supply to the encoders on the servo motors in order to preserve the position as long as the power supply to the main cabinet is not turned off.  In the event of a power down condition, if "normal" encoders are used, the system will require re-homing before use.  If absolute encoders are used, absolute position will be maintained through a complete power down.  Will absolute encoders be required for this application?  Answer: The intent of the performance criteria is to re-adjust, re-align, re-synchronize the system when a fault has caused the horizonatally level attitude of the chamber dome to have been violated. It is not intended that any power down condition should cause the need to exercise the automatic process of re-adjustment, re-alignment, re-synchronization. 4. Question: The specification is somewhat ambiguous as to the number of brakes.  Will a brake be required on the motor or both the motor AND the cylinder?  Answer: The specified performance criteria state the types of motion that must be eliminated by the application of braking within the system. Again, it is not part of the specifications to dictate exactly how those criteria are met. Objective evidence of compliance of the performance criteria is what is required. Each matched set of servo motor and electric cyclinder must have independent brakes. 5. Question: Will variable speed be required with the jog joystick controller?	If not, the jog speed can be programmed through the operator terminal and the motors will accelerate and jog at that fixed speed using discrete control.  Answer: The jog control joystick will initiate motion in the direction commanded at whatever speed is set prior to issuance of the command. Variable speed is required, but is not required to be set or changed by the jog control joystick. 6. Question: Installation and training is not specified on the solicitation.  Note 4 on sheet 1 of 4 calls for transfer of holes and mounting a plate to the existing frame.  What is the specific scope of installation, set up and training?   Answer: This is instructions for drilling holes in the existing frame located at MSFC.  No special training required. 7. Question: My intent is to set up and tune the servos at MSFC.  Would this be acceptable?   Answer: Yes 8. Question: Will the 10,000 lb proof loading take place at MSFC?  Will the 10,000 lb load be supplied there? Answer: Yes, Yes The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the informatiuments reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
