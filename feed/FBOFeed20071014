Water, in the form of a salt laden mist, enters the mechanical room through these louvers and contributes to accelerated corrosion of equipment in the room, particularly a boiler located adjacent to the louvers. 

Work Scope: Replace the louvers designed specifically to resist wind, rain, sand, birds and insects while permitting a flow of outside air into the mechanical room with a minimum of pressure drop. Provide an approximately 14 ft wide by 9 ft, 6 in. tall louver with rain baffles. Recess the louvers within the existing wall opening. Provide the minimum net free area required by the fuel burning appliances located in the mechanical room.

Statement of Work for Commercial Lease of Administrative Vehicles
U. S. Department of State
(A/OPR/GSM/FMO)

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Continuous long term (e.g., twelve consecutive months or longer) lease of administrative vehicles.

VEHICLE SUMMARY
The general types of vehicles required shall be as follows:
	Automobiles/Sedans: sub-compact, compact, mid-size, large executive, premium executive
	Passenger Vans: seven to fifteen passenger, front-wheel or all-wheel drive when available
	Cargo Vans: compact and full-size
	Pick Up Trucks: compact, mid- and full-sizes, 2- and 4-door, standard and extended cab, 4x2 and 4x4
	Sport Utility Vehicles: compact, mid- and full-sizes, 2- and 4-door, 4x2 and 4x4

The DOS will specify vehicle type and desired options on each call; Lessor may provide any manufacturer model vehicle that meets both DOS requirements and Buy American Act regulations.  Vehicles may be any color (black, dark blue, or white preferred), with the exception that large executive and premium executive sedans must be black or dark blue.  

Vehicles will be provided with flexible fuel gas/ethanol (E85) capability when available from manufacturers in the type and class of vehicle ordered.  Hybrid electric vehicles and vehicles operating on alternative fuels, such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or propane, are acceptable when available from manufacturers in the type and class of vehicle ordered, but must be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). It is the DOS's intent to burn biodiesel fuel in any diesel-powered vehicle provided by the Lessor, unless specifically prohibited by the vehicle manufacturer; it is the Lessor's responsibility to notify the COR of any such prohibitions prior to accepting the call for the vehicle.  The Lessor will not provide 4x4 vehicles unless specifically ordered or approved in advance by the COR.

LEASE TERMS
Basic Agreement Period: The BPA shall be valid for one base year with two one-year options. 

General: In response to this request for proposal (RFP), the Lessor will provide a price schedule for all vehicle types the Lessor will make available under this BPA; the Lessor's price proposal will become a formal part of the BPA upon award. While the Lessor is not required to provide a price schedule for every vehicle type listed above, the Lessor must include a price proposal for large executive and premium executive four-door sedans as a minimum. 

The DOS will initially lease individual vehicles for twelve (12) consecutive months; each individual lease may be extended in one-month or multiple-month intervals thereafter, not to exceed 36 months in total.  Prior to expiration of any given lease period as specified in the call, the Contracting Officer (CO) will issue a formal modification to extend the lease if needed; the modification will specify the number of additional months and the corresponding price per month as specified in the Lessor's price schedule. 

There is no guaranteed minimum quantity that the DOS will order.

Ordering: As requirements arise, the COR will notify the Lessor of desired vehicle types, quantities, specifications and lease duration by fax or email, based on vehicle types offered in the Lessor's proposal. Within two business days of receipt of a request from the COR, the Lessor will notify the COR (by return fax or email) of vehicle availability and delivery lead-time for each vehicle requested.  The Lessor may offer and the COR may accept substitution of specific vehicle types/options other than those initially requested by the COR when agreed to by the COR in advance and at no additional cost to the government.  Upon determination by the COR that the Lessor's response is satisfactory to meet requirements, the Contracting Officer (CO) will issue a formal call against the BPA for the agreed upon vehicle(s) at the price specified in the Lessor's price schedule. The Lessor will then provide vehicles to the COR within 15 days of issuance of the call by the CO, unless otherwise agreed in advance by the Lessor and the COR, in which case a not later than delivery date will be specified in the call. The Lessor will not provide vehicles to the COR until directed to do so by the CO via formal BPA call.

Extensions: Individual vehicle leases may be extended on a month-to-month or multiple-month basis by modification to the initial call prior to expiration of the call.  Existing calls may be extended and new calls may be issued up until the last day of the BPA base year or option year.  In those cases where the end of the period of performance specified in a call falls after the end of the BPA base/option year, the vehicle lease will terminate at the end of the period of performance specified in the individual call.  

Pricing:  For each vehicle type offered, the Lessor will provide a price schedule that includes standard per-month rates for months 1-12, months 13-24 and months 25-36. The DOS will issue calls for vehicle leases for any period of time ranging from twelve to 36 months, and will reimburse the Lessor the applicable rate for each month of the lease as specified in the Lessor's price schedule. (As a practical example, if the DOS issues a call for a vehicle lease for a 16 month period, the first twelve months will be invoiced/reimbursed at the monthly rate specified for months 1-12, and the next four months will be reimbursed at the rates specified for months 13-24.  Likewise, a 26 month lease will be invoiced/reimbursed at the rate specified for months 1-12 during the first twelve months, at the rates specified for months 13-24 for the next twelve months, and at the rates specified for months 25-36 for the last two months.) This rate structure will apply for all vehicles continuously leased by the DOS with no contractual break in service. For the purposes of this requirement, vehicles replaced during the specified lease period at the Lessor's discretion, because of maintenance problems, or due to age and mileage stipulations contained in other parts of this agreement, will be considered to be continuous, uninterrupted leases. 
Prices specified in the schedule will include no-charge mileage allowances available to the Lessor's best customers. Charges for cumulative mileage beyond Lessor-defined annual limits, if any, will be clearly defined in the Lessor's proposal. Finally, discounts for prompt payment will be defined in the Lessor's proposal.

Vehicle Replacements: The DOS may, at its option, require replacement of any vehicle that reaches three years of age or 45,000 miles during the agreed upon lease period, with the exception that the DOS may require replacement of large executive and premium executive sedans that reach two years of age or 30,000 miles. If this occurs, the Lessor will provide the replacement vehicle to the DOS for the remainder of the period specified in the call at no additional charge, and the replacement vehicle will be considered a continuous, uninterrupted lease as defined above. The Lessor may not replace any vehicle during the first 12-months of any lease period unless agreed upon in advance by the COR.

Termination:  
	General: Any vehicle(s) leased prior to the BPA expiration date will be retained by the DOS for the entire period of performance specified in the call regardless of the expiration date of the BPA; all terms and conditions of the BPA will remain in full force until the end of the lease period specified in each individual call.

	Grace Period:  At the end of each lease period, the Lessor will grant DOS a five workday grace period for DOS to ready the vehicle for return to the Lessor.  The Lessor will not charge DOS any lease fees during the grace period. Should the DOS fail to return the vehicle by the end of the grace period, the Lessor will be entitled to pro-rata payment for each day past the five-workday grace period (see Payments below). For the purposes of this requirement, a workday is defined as Monday through Friday, not including days the federal government is closed for business. 

	Delivery & Pick Up: The Lessor will deliver vehicles at the beginning of each lease period and retrieve vehicles at the end of each lease period at a location that is no more than 10 miles from the Main State building, located at 2201 C Street NW, Washington, DC 20520, unless otherwise agreed upon in advance by the Lessor and the COR. The cost of such delivery and retrieval shall be included in the Lessor's final price proposal.  The Lessor's responsibility for delivery shall be met when the Lessor notifies the COR that the vehicle is ready for pick up by the DOS at the agreed upon location. The DOS's responsibility for return of vehicles shall be met when the COR notifies the Lessor that the vehicle is available for pick up by the Lessor at the agreed upon location.

INVOICES AND PAYMENTS
Invoices: The Lessor will send invoices to the COR by the 10th day of each calendar month for each vehicle leased the previous calendar month.    The Lessor will bill monthly for all leases, regardless of the length of the lease specified in the call. Invoices shall clearly specify the vehicle ID number and all associate charges for the month. The Lessor will specify all credits and any applicable discounts offered to the DOS for prompt payment on each invoice.

Payments: DOS will verify and submit invoices for payment upon receipt from the Lessor. If it becomes necessary for any reason to determine a daily or monthly rate for pro-rata invoice adjustments, a daily rate will be determined by dividing the monthly rate specified in the call by 30 days. 

Charges for excess mileage beyond Lessor-defined annual limits and discount credits for prompt payment, if any, will be clearly identified on each invoice.  Excess mileage charges will be authorized for payment when such charges are in accordance with the Lessor's proposal and determined to be customary and reasonable by the COR. 


MAINTENANCE & REPAIRS 
The Lessor shall provide routine preventive maintenance (lubrication, oil/filter changes, replacement wipers and bulbs, etc.), breakdown maintenance/repairs, safety/emissions tests/inspections, and road-side assistance at no additional cost to DOS.  The Lessor will notify DOS when each vehicle is due for preventive maintenance, inspection or repair, and where the vehicle should be taken to obtain the required service.  DOS will deliver the vehicle to the designated maintenance facility as soon as possible for essential repairs (e.g., items due to manufacturer safety recall or that may cause damage to the equipment or a safety hazard for the operator or occupants) and within 10 work days of notice for non-essential service, and will retrieve the vehicle from that location upon notice from the vendor or Lessor that maintenance has been completed. The DOS will not have any repairs made to any vehicle without prior approval of the Lessor.

The Lessor will pay all fees and charges associated with vehicle towing, maintenance, repairs and inspections directly to the vendor performing the service. Lessor-designated maintenance facilities shall be within 10 miles of the Main State building, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Lessor and the COR. DOS will pay all normal operating expenses, including gasoline, oil, and tolls and parking fees.

The Lessor will provide a temporary replacement loaner vehicle, similar to the original vehicle, for any vehicle that will be out of service for maintenance or repairs for more than three consecutive business days; such loaner vehicles will be provided for the entire time period the original vehicle is out of service after the third day, and at no additional charge to the DOS.  The Lessor will provide a permanent replacement vehicle for any vehicle that will be out of service for more than ten consecutive workdays or that is out of service for breakdown repairs on more than three occasions during any twelve month period. Such permanent replacement vehicles will be provided for the remainder of the original vehicle lease period, and at no additional charge to the DOS; in these instances, the replacement vehicle shall meet the same specifications as the vehicle being replaced, unless differences in specifications are agreed upon in advance by the COR, and will be considered a continuation of the original lease for pricing purposes.

LICENSING FEES AND TAXES
Lessor shall pay all vehicle title, registration and licensing fees, charges and taxes.

LICENSE PLATES
All vehicles provided by the Lessor will be properly licensed, at the Lessor's expense, in accordance with procedures specified by the state in which the vehicle is registered.  The DOS reserves the right to replace Lessor vehicle license plates with official federal government vehicle license plates.  The DOS will ensure the security of license plates removed from Lessor vehicles and will replace the Lessor plates on the vehicle prior to return to the Lessor at the end of the lease period. 

INSURANCE
As a self-insured entity, the DOS shall be responsible for all repairs, or reimbursement for same to the Lessor, for any non-normal wear and tear or other damage sustained by the vehicle while in possession of the DOS. In the event DOS chooses to reimburse the Lessor for the cost of repairs  greater than $500, the DOS will reimburse the Lessor in an amount equal to the lesser of two commercial repair estimates, or the average of three commercial repair estimates obtained by the Lessor and provided to the COR. For repairs of $500 or less, the DOS will repair the vehicle or reimburse the Lessor based on one commercial repair estimate provided by the Lessor.  Repair or reimbursement will be at the COR's discretion.

For the purposes of this requirement, vehicles will be considered to be in the possession of the DOS from the time the DOS takes physical possession of the vehicle at the designated drop off point at the beginning of the lease period until the time the DOS delivers the vehicle to the designated drop off point at the end of the lease period, not including the time the vehicle is at a Lessor-designated maintenance/repair facility, during which time any damages to the vehicle will be addressed between the Lessor and the Lessor-designated repair facility. Drop off locations are addressed above, in the sub-paragraph entitled Delivery & Pick Up.


VEHICLE SPECIFICATIONS
Lessors will respond to DOS's request for vehicles with a description of the vehicle (e.g., make, model, year of manufacture, body style, color, odometer reading, etc.) it proposes to provide to meet the DOS's requirement.  As a minimum, all vehicles will be provided with features, equipment, safety features and accessories defined by the vehicle's manufacturer as standard.  If the Lessor chooses to provide vehicles with additional features or comfort and convenience items not specifically requested by the DOS (such as high performance engines, heavy duty alternators,  heated seats, dual zone air conditioning, remote keyless entry, alarm system, etc.), such features will be provided at no additional cost to the DOS.  If the DOS requires features beyond those defined as standard, the COR will obtain availability, delivery lead-time and itemized price surcharge information for each additional feature from the Lessor prior to submitting a formal call for the vehicle; in the event the DOS eventually orders the vehicle, the call will specify the desired additional features and the authorized surcharge amount that the Lessor may add to the basic monthly rate specified for that vehicle in the price schedule.

The Lessor will furnish to the DOS two (2) sets of vehicle keys, including remote keyless entry fobs if the vehicle is so equipped, which will be returned to the Lessor at lease termination.  The DOS will be responsible for the replacement of lost or damaged keys and remote entry fobs.
