Background
<p>The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by "bridges". The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics. The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals. The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.</p>
<p>The Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences (RAD&amp;IS) provides imaging services to the CC patients who participate in research protocols conducted by the various NIH institutes. Imaging services include X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans and interventional radiology (special procedures). Diagnostic services in ultrasound, digital mammography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and nuclear medicine are also provided. All these diagnostic modalities generate clinical diagnostic images that are sent to and archived on the RAD&amp;IS's Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). The departmental radiologists review the diagnostic images and dictate clinical findings using a Voice Recognition system (VRS). The finds are saved in reports which are stored in the RAD&amp;IS's Radiology Information System (RIS) and forwarded to the Clinical Research Information System or the Clinical Center's Hospital Information System (CRIS).<br />The advanced visualization workstations are medical diagnostic imaging systems that utilize computerized visualization techniques to provide enhanced image displays, e.g. 3D or 4D displays. The visualization workstations provide the radiologists with a means to further process and review the clinical diagnostic patient related images stored in the PACS. Advanced visualization technology is needed by the NIH Clinical Center to make radiologic clinical diagnosis easier, faster, and more reliable.<br />GE Healthcare is the manufacturer of the GE Advanced Workstation Server (AWS) purchased by the department in 2010 and installed and maintained under warranty through April 2011. As such GE is the who can provide the components required to maintain the capabilities of its AWS system. The advanced visualization technology provided by the GE software is an important component of the Radiology and Enterprise's image viewing experience. The system involves proprietary software manufactured by GE and hardware designed to meet GE's exacting requirements. A seamless integration and the interaction of the hardware specified by GE is required to assure the integrity and functionality of the advanced visualization software.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p><br />This request is for the purchase of a maintenance contract with GE Medical for it's the GE Advanced Workstation Serer (AWS) for the period of one year. The GE AWS is&nbsp; in daily use by the RAD&amp;IS for critical patient care.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>To provide support for the GE AWS:<br /><br />1. Hardware and software support service 8am-5pm Monday - Friday<br />2. Six Hour on-site response time<br />3. Technical phone support<br />4. Priority parts delivery<br />5. Preventive maintenance coverage Monday - Friday 8am-5pm<br />6. Safety and Quality Software updates<br />7. TIP answer line<br />8. 95% up time commitment</p>
