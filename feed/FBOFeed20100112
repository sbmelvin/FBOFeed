<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)Training System Acquisition and Support (TSAS) Contracts
This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for planning purposes in accordance with FAR 15.201(e).  The information gathered by this RFI will be used for the purpose of identifying potential sources with the capabilities to accomplish the efforts as described in the paragraphs below.  Information gathered will also aide in 677th Aeronautical Systems Group (677 AESG) efforts to establish a streamlined and standardized acquisition process for delivering and supporting Air Force (AF) training systems.  
677 AESG Mission:  The 677 AESG mission is to lead the development, acquisition and sustainment effort necessary to meet every AF major command's simulation and training requirement.  The 677th AESG at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio is responsible for end-to-end lifecycle management of AF training systems encompassing complex aircrew, maintenance, and system-specific training systems in support of warfighter training at operating locations worldwide.  677 AESG customers include AF active duty, reserve, and National Guard and Department of Defense joint warfighter as well as Foreign Military Sales (FMS).  Aircraft platforms supported include:  fighter, bomber, cargo/airlift/tanker, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and special operations that include helicopter platforms.  Training system performance parameters are defined by requirements unique to each platform's mission and unique training needs.  
Capability Required:  Performance-based acquisition of training systems encompasses the tasks of analysis, design, development, production, installation, integration, test, database generation and sustainment.  Sustainment of fielded simulation systems entails system modification, upgrades, maintenance, and follow-on production activities.  System modernization and modification is required to ensure accurate representation of aircraft capabilities, described as maintaining concurrency with operational aircraft as well as, technology insertion to address obsolescence issues that ensures continued system viability.  The sustainment of AF training systems is accomplished via Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), which include elements of follow-on development, production, modernization, and support as well as training-related services such as courseware maintenance, academic/simulator instruction and security support.
Capabilities replicated in training simulations include aircraft operations, weapons employment, navigation, and command and control.  Simulation systems deliver the full range of required training from individual and aircrew events in a single aircraft to large-scale, theater specific, composite force mission rehearsal training.  Training systems support initial qualification, upgrade, continuation, and mission rehearsal training.  Maintenance training systems support the training of aircraft maintenance procedures specific to major subsystems of an aircraft platform that may include diagnostic and/or remove and replace tasks.  System-specific training systems provide solutions to unique training needs, such as the Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTCTRS) that provides mission-rehearsal training scenarios to the Forward Air Controllers.  
Systems Description:  The capabilities to be procured under TSAS contracts range from the acquisition and support of extremely complex system of systems to the basic sustainment of a single trainer.  Some of the factors which contribute to program complexity include the phase of the system lifecycle, complexity of the platform being simulated, interoperability to other systems, the number of systems and operating locations to be supported, and specific technical solutions implemented.   
A Total Training System is a complex system of systems that includes a full complement of aircrew and maintenance trainers that together with academic instruction support the training required to execute weapon system mission(s).  Acquisition of a complex system of systems includes development, production and sustainment of Aircrew Training Devices.  Such systems require high-fidelity simulation training as defined by the using organization and/or Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) certifications.  For example, a high-fidelity training device in support of the AF's mobility mission simulates aircraft capabilities and also incorporates motion capability as well as realistic out-the-window displays to deliver immersive training.  These types of training systems are also capable of linking with local and geographically-separated training systems to conduct training operations.  System of systems may also include acquisition and support of Maintenance Training Devices.  Acquisition a! nd sustainment of complex systems typically delivers multiple training operations at multiple locations worldwide. 
At the other end of the range of capabilities to be procured would be the sustainment of a single type of training device with a single configuration. Absent are the requirements for high-fidelity training and/or local or long-haul connectivity with other training systems.  Such a program typically requires little modernization or follow-on production.  Emphasis is placed on operations and maintenance to include routine device upgrades in support of training at a limited number of operating locations, usually US-based. 
Additionally, services procured may include guaranteed student throughput, academic/instructor, courseware development and/or maintenance, and security services.
Because of the aforementioned requirement for training representative of aircraft capabilities, TSAS contractors shall procure the capability to establish and sustain an Associate Contractors Agreement (ACA) with an aircraft prime that includes classified documentation.
Acquisition Initiative:  Whether it is the acquisition or sustainment phase of a simulation training system, emphasis remains on timely delivery and sustained total training system performance.  In order to meet the challenge of executing an increasing number of programs, the 677 AESG must streamline and standardize its training system acquisition and support procurement processes.  The AF previously attempted to satisfy this requirement through the utilization of competitively-awarded Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts referred to the Training System Acquisition (TSA) I and II.  The AF remains committed to the ID/IQ approach and respondents are encouraged to provide recommendations for achieving this goal.  The AF is planning a similar multiple award, ID/IQ contracts that includes both large and small business, referred to as Training System Acquisition and Support (TSAS) contracts.  The TSAS contracts have an anticipated award date of late Calendar Y! ear (CY) 2011 or early CY 2012.  Elements under consideration include:  
a.	Contract length:  The TSAS ID/IQ contracts are expected to have an ordering period that may be up to 10 years in length.
b.	Delivery Order Length:  individual delivery orders under a TSAS contract may range in length from 5 - 10 years.  Different factors may determine the length based on the range of products or services to be delivered.  
c.	Contract types:  Both FAR Part 12 and 15 with Firm Fixed Price, Fixed Price Award Fee, Fixed Price Incentive Fee, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Cost Plus Award Fee and Time & Material are being considered.  
d.	677 AESG utilization of templates, a user's guide, and web-based application for execution
e.	Small business participation:  A determination will be made based on overall market research to include RFI responses. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is expected to be 336413, with a size limit of fewer than 1,000 employees including the offeror and its affiliates.

<a href="mailto:janessa.m.schantin@nasa.gov">Janessa M Schantin</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend Contract NNA08BA47C (INTEGRATION OF ADVANCED CONCEPTSAND VEHICLES INTO THE AIRSPACE CONCEPT EVALUATION SYSTEM) with Raytheon Company on asole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. Theobjective is to extend the performance period for four months. This contract modification is for the acquisition of refined results based upon theknowledge gained as a result of the extensive analysis performed during the contractedresearch, and to solicit consensus in the form of recommended inputs into theMulti-Agency Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) Next Generation AirTransportation System (NextGen) planning documents and portfolio analysis, andconsequently JPDO and NASA activities.	The Government intends to obtain this service tocontinue the support in several areas where the contractors support is unique and timecritical.  The extension is needed to enable the continuation of the current contract (whichresulted from a NASA Research Announcement (NRA)) in order to enhance the value of thedeliverables outlined in Task 9, Dissemination of Results, through further refinementand improvement of the results obtained.  The research and analysis conducted over thecourse of this contract has highlighted the need for updates to the planning documentsand portfolio analysis.  The extension will allow these results to be efficientlyincorporated into the JPDO NextGen planning documents and portfolio analysis.  Theseplanning documents consist of the Concept of Operations (ConOps), Integrated Work Plan(IWP) and Enterprise Architecture (EA).  Both the ConOps, IWP and portfolio analysis arecurrently being updated and this effort would be ideally timed to achieve the maximumbenefit.The current contractor has developed highly relevant data that the JPDO has identified asan important enhancement to their EA, IWP and JPE.   Task 9, has been focused on threeUser and stakeholder workshops (contract deliverables), technical papers andpresentations at professional technical conferences, and a final report (contractdeliverable).  This research data and information, to be most relevant to the JPDO, needsto be inserted and expanded upon into the JPDOs NextGen Concept of Operations (ConOps),EA and IWP.  Therefore, this extension will provide for the refinement and transfer ofresearch data and information to the JPDO for their specific needs. The extension will increase the current contract value and extend the period ofperformance for a period of four months, from March 1, 2010, through July 1, 2010. Thecurrent contractor, Raytheon Company, is considered the only contractor that can meetthis requirement given the short period of performance for the extension.  Award toanother source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that isnot expected to be recovered through competition of the extension, or unacceptable delaysin fulfilling the agencys requirements.    This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort IN WRITING to the identified pointof contact not later than 5 PM PST on January 27, 2010. Such communication ofcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Oral communicationsare not acceptable in response to this notice. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Written questions regarding the extension can be sent via email to Janessa Schantin atjanessa.m.schantin@nasa.gov.

<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals. The Bureau of Reclamation Snake River Area Office intends to issue a sole source contract with HSQ Technology of Hayward, California to supply replacement RTU Central Processing Units (CPU) and communications cards for the Minidoka and Palisades facilities and to install a MOD Bus communications protocol on the Palisades host computer. This will include all necessary hardware and software changes needed for the SIP SCADA system to read the government-supplied temperature recording devices.
HSQ technology will provide software and hardware changes as needed to allow the SIP SCADASystem to gather a select number of data points from the Thermo Fisher Scientific Model SV180 data logger. It is anticipated that this will require installing and setting up a MODBus Communications protocol that will interface with the existing SIP SCADA system miser database.  
Parties who believe they have knowledge sufficient to respond may e-mail their firms qualifications to the following address:  mday@usbr.gov.  No phone or fax inquiries will be allowed.

<DESC>RECOVERY - The purpose of this project is to secure the services for hazardous fuels reduction and timber stand improvement on approximately 2,500 acres of National Forest land on the Northern Hills Ranger District.  The work for this project consists of reducing the potential of a wildfires reaching private homes adjacent to the National Forest and to provide strategic locations to help firefighters contain future wildfires and selectively thinning to leave the largest healthy trees.  To achieve these objectives, this will require reducing the density of trees from seedings two feet high up to trees with a 7 inch diameter at breast height (DBH).  The fuels reduction will occure on National Forest lands adjacent to private lands.  This will require the contractor concern for stand visuals after treatment and the protection of private property during the treatment.  This project will have three bid items, 2 mechanical bid items and 1 thin with hand piling bid item.

The location of this project is on the Northern Hills Ranger District, Lawrence county, South Dakota.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT - THE NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC) HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED UNDER THEAMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 TO ISSUE A TASK ORDER FOR ENGINEERINGSUPPORT SERVICES UNDER THE PREVIOUSLY AWARDED, COMPETITIVE 8(a) CONTRACT NNC06BA07B WITHASRC AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) represent new vehicle and operational concepts in civilaviation.  These new concepts are evolving as the nation moves toward the Next GenerationAir Transportation System (NextGen), which is under the leadership of the Joint Planningand Development Office (JPDO).	The desire and ability to fly UAS in the National AirSpace (NAS) in the near term has increased dramatically.  Although unmanned aircraft have the ability to support a number of dull, dirty anddangerous missions required by the nations science community (NASA, NOAA), emergencymanagement (FEMA, DOA) and national security and defense organizations (DHS, DOD),existing federal air regulations, procedures and technologies do not allow routine UASaccess to the NAS. The current process of requesting a Certificate of Waiver ofAuthorization (COA) to operate a UAS in the national airspace today is extremely resourceintensive and lengthy.	These COAs are restrictive and often lack the flexibility to meetthe full mission needs.  The UAS project provides NASA support to this multi-agencyobjective of enabling safe, routine access for unmanned aircraft systems in the nationalairspace.Over the course of the next 12 months, the UAS Project will focus on supporting amulti-agency effort to develop and implement a national plan to successful address thechallenges of UAS access to the NAS (National Air Space) in a safe and timely manner.  Inorder to support this activity, the UAS Project will develop two Concept of Operations(ConOps) documents.  From these documents, overall Research and Development (R&D) needswill be identified.NASA/GRC intends to issue a task order under existing contract NNC06BA07B to developdocumentation on research and development requirements that will guide how futureunmanned aircraft systems (UAS) can safely operate in the national airspace. Specifically, the research for this task focuses on how unmanned aircraft systems cansafely communicate with ground controllers using existing communication systems, as thenumber of UAS continue to increase in the future.  This task also focuses on weatherhazards as they impact UAS during flight.  The result of this task is analysis andidentification of research and development needs for UAS communication systems, includingweather hazards that impact UAS during flight. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. This announcement will not result in a Request for Proposal; this announcement is forinformational purposes only. All questions and/or concerns must be submitted in writingto points of contact contained herein. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with TA Instruments – Waters, LLC, of New Castle, Delaware for the purchase of a Thermogravic Analyzer (TGA)/Quadruple Mass Spectrometer (QMS)  System under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

The Carbon Mitigation Project being conducted by the Ceramics Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology is developing standards and measurements in the area of solid sorbents for CO2 capture applications.  The analysis of CO2 sorption performance being conducted requires a gravimetric gas sorption analyzer (TGA) with a microbalance sensitivity of at least 0.5 micrograms that can accommodate up to three simultaneous gas connections.  It must also operate at temperatures up to 800C and pressures up to 50 bars.

The TGA must also be equipped with an integrated quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for on-line analysis of multiple gases that would evolve during competitive sorption experiments.   TA – Waters’ integration of a Pfeiffer QMS with its TGA is crucial for studies involving selective removal of CO2 from a gas mixture with a composition that mimics emissions from stationary sources such as power plants.  

While the TGA can provide accurate information about changes in mass upon gas adsorption or desorption at given temperature-pressure conditions, the integrated Pfeiffer QMS accessory can unravel in real time which specific gases are being adsorbed or desorbed.

The TA-Waters integrated TGA/QMS is capable of measuring adsorption/desorption isotherms of solid samples for various gases, such as water vapor, organic vapors, hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide under static or dynamic flow dosing conditions, and is unique in its ability to accommodate up to three simultaneous gas connections, while also meeting NIST’s microbalance, operating temperature, and pressure requirements.  The high pressure TGA/QMS offered by TA Instruments - Waters, LLC is the only commercially available integrated system that meets all of NIST’s specific research needs.  

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (EST) on January 27, 2010.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S.Army Test & Evaluation Command intends to modify the existing contract W9115U-08-D-0001 for the procurement of 700 each, Real-Time Enhanced Global Positioning Systems currently provided by Geodetics.  The contract performance period to issue delivery orders ends 20 August 2012. To meet mission requirements, the GPS must be able to provide complete collection, data manipulation, data display and data recording of sub-meter accuracy Time, Space and Position Information (TSPI) test data.  Additionally, the system must have selectable reporting and recording rates from 1 sample every 10 seconds up to and including five samples per second in order to be used on different platforms of FCS.   The system must be able to record this type of TSPI data with synchronized GPS time for extended periods.  Geodetics is the sole developer and the proprietor of the technical and software data (Geodetics Epoch-by-Epoch" (EBE)), of the Government owned units which must be 100% compatible.  It is therefore in the best interest of the Government to increase the quantity ceiling on the Geodetics contract.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Interested organizations may submit their capability statements, and qualifications for the provision of this requirement, which will be considered in accordance with numbered notes 22. This is not a solicitation, but a Notice of Intent.

<DESC>The US Army ARDEC is conducting a market survey to identify potential sourcesfor Multi-Variable Armament Systems for Manned and Unmanned Vehicles who are also knowledgeable of Remote Weapon Systems (RWS).  All interested firms shall submit their technical capabilities (10 pages maximum) for the above to include the following at no cost to the Government.  Costs for proposal submissions are strictly the responsibility of the interested contractor.  To date, these systems are heavy, expensive and the gun systems of these RWS are not robotized. The ammunition is part of the RWS which adds a lot of weight to the RWS and therefore expensive heavy large motors are needed.  Vehicle Integration Kits are required for installation of each RWS onto the vehicle platform.  This effort will allow for the manufacture of prototype new armaments and RWS components that solve the present RWS problems such as material degradation, weight requirements, vehicle integration, processing & fabrication, jamming, ammo storage & loading.  This effort also includes the manufacture of munition components, projectiles that may transform into Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) projectiles, platforms in support of lightweight and/or advanced systems or subsystems for manned and unmanned vehicles.


Contractor must be experienced with fabricating, machining, and working with various types of metals, fabricating prototypes, and manufacturing of munition components.  Contractor shall provide consultant(s) support as needed which includes knowledge of advanced materials, munition items, and manned/unmanned vehicles.  Contractor shall have the capability to develop design concepts and provide manufacturing insight for product improvement, integration, upgrades, and producibility analysis (such as Vehicle Integration Kit development).  

Interested firms, who feel they are capable, are invited to indicate their interest by providing to the U.S. Army a brief summary of their companys capabilities including a brief description of training units and verification of existing prototype/commercially available units. These technical capabilities shall be submitted ELECTRONICALLY ONLY, and within fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice to Matthew Endrizzi (email address: matt.endrizzi@us.army.mil).  Please note that telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  Please also provide the companys name, address, point of contact with telephone number and email address, size of business (small/large) and team members.

Services in support of patient care programs. All workmanship shall be in accordance with practices/guidelines established by the National Association of Institutional Linen Management (NAILM), International Fabricare Institute (IFI), Textile Rental Services Association (TRSA) and accepted industry standards.  It is intended that services shall include all processes necessary for the laundering and finishing of the articles even though every step involved is not specifically mentioned.  All work shall be performed under sanitary conditions as specified by the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO).  Physical separation, through the presence of a barrier wall and the use of pass-through equipment is required to maintain positive air pressure in the clean section relative to a negative air pressure in the soiled section.  In no case shall clean and soiled linen share the same physical space.  The Laundry Plant layout/design should incorporate a "design for asepsis" whereby clean linen neither comes into contact with soiled linens nor shares the same physical space, thus avoiding cross-contamination and/or reintroduction of bacteria once processed.  Plants in which the work is done shall be open to inspection of sanitary conditions by Government representatives.  After processing, laundered articles shall be in serviceable and sanitary condition, meeting established quality and performance requirement standards.Contractor Experience:  The Contractor shall have experience in providing Medical Center laundry/linen services.  The firm must have gained this experience as a result of being primarily engaged in the business of providing laundry/linen services in Medical Center environments (e.g. inpatient and outpatient medical treatment facilities) for a minimum of three consecutive years prior to submitting proposal. Must be certified by NAILM or graduate of an independently controlled management-training program emphasizing institutional laundry.  The formal course must have been previously established. CPM shall have at least three years of specialized experience in this capacity.  This specialized experience may be substituted for certification.Training: Contractor personnel shall adhere to established training criteria (such as OSHA, JCAHO), and shall be able to demonstrate a documented employee initial and refresher training program that includes standard precautions, basic bacteriological concepts, infection control, safety, fire protection, PPE, and laundry operating procedures and policies.Exposure to Hazardous Working Conditions.  Contractor personnel are required to perform work under potentially hazardous conditions.  Contractor personnel shall be informed of potentially hazardous situations by Contractor and trained by Contractor in techniques required to recognize and deal with potentially hazardous situations in a manner which will minimize personal risk.  The Contractor is required to adhere to standard techniques for personnel who become injured or ill on the job at no cost to the Government.  Contractor is also responsible for providing employees with required personal protective equipment.Services are required Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays except as awarded.  VISN 7 Medical Centers are required to provide 24-hour support operations essential to patient care and Contractor services turn-around shall be performed accordingly to support VAMC(s) operations. All services shall be provided FOB at VAMC(s) location identified.Estimated Quantities:  Historical data is provided (Attachment 2). It is impossible to determine exact quantities that will be required during the contract term. Each offer whose offer is accepted wholly or in part will be required to provide all services that may be ordered during the contract term.  The fact that all quantities are not ordered shall not constituted a price adjustment under any resulting contract. The Government contemplates a single award of Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract for 12 consecutive months from date of award, with four (4) one year renewal option periods. The NAICS code for this requisition is 812332 with a small business size of $14.0 million. Request for offer will only be accepted from responsible businesses currently engaged in this type of commerce. Interested parties must respond with short synopsis of their capabilities in writing, along with company name, address and telephone number to: ATTN: Robin Jones, Contract Specialist, (478) 274-5578 (fax) or email robin.jones2@va.gov.NO TELEPHONE REQUEST WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, U. S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri, intends to award on a sole source base under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 with Fresenius USA, 2637 Shadelands Drive, Walnut Creek, CA 94598 for the procurement of seven (7) 2008K2 dialysis machines, seven (7) CMS-208K Bedside screens and keyboards, and seven (7) retractile cord kit. This requirement is to replace aged machines due to extensive usage. Fifty-six (56) Fresenius 2008K machines are currently in operation six days each week and these additional dialysis machines will replace aged machines due to extensive usage. All dialysis machines are designed to download patient data into the Fresenius CMS 2008K Data Management System. This system allows for the gathering of all aspects of the patient's treatment which monitors and stores critical information in a unique hardware and software system designed specifically for the Fresenius 2008K dialysis machines. Due to the specific necessity of calibration requirements and compatibility, this notice is being issued. The procurement will be for a firm-fixed priced purchase order. Any firm who believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer by January 20, 2010, 2:00 p.m. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements listed and must show competition would be advantageous to the Government. Responses received will be evaluated, however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the sole source procurement to Fresenius, USA.

<DESC>Sources Sought announcements are issued to assist the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in performing market research to determine industry interest and capability to obtain company demographics, benchmarking information and industry ideas for an acquisition approach.  This Sources Sought announcement is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) and at this time, no solicitation exists.

INTRODUCTION:   The Agency’s mission is to safeguard the United States and its allies from Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) by providing capabilities to reduce, eliminate and counter the threat and its effects. This mission dictates a diverse set of customers and unique mission requirements. The Agency’s Enterprises requirements are equally diverse and unique.  

BACKGROUND:   The DTRA intends to award a firm fixed price contract for Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Support Services for the Office of the Chief of Staff.   

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) generally provides that any person has a right, enforceable in court, to obtain access to federal agency records, except to the extent that such records (or portions of them) are protected from public disclosure by one of nine exemptions or by one of three special law enforcement exclusions.  Taking effect on July 4, 1967, the FOIA firmly establishes an effective statutory right of public access to executive branch information in the federal government.

The purpose of the Privacy Act of 1974 is to balance the government’s need to maintain information about individuals with the rights of individuals to be protected against unwarranted invasions of their privacy stemming from federal agencies’ collection, maintenance, use, and disclosure of information about them.  The Act focuses on four basic policy objectives:

(1)	To restrict disclosure of personally identifiable records maintained by agencies.
(2)	To grant individuals increased rights of access to agency records maintained on themselves.
(3)	To grant individuals the right to seek amendment of agency records maintained on themselves upon showing that the records are not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete.
(4)	To establish a code of “fair information practices” which requires agencies to comply with statutory norms for collection, maintenance, and dissemination of records?

The Department of Defense has directed through DoD Directives 5400.7-R (“DoD Freedom of Information Act Program”) and 5400.11-R (Department of Defense Privacy Program”) policies and procedures for each Program.  Each Defense Agency is responsible for the processing of FOIA and Privacy Act requests for information which is under their purview.  

REQUIREMENTS:  DTRA intends to procure Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Support Services.   DTRA intends to issues a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act Support Services at the headquarters in Fort Belvoir, VA. The contractor shall provide the personnel necessary to perform these services.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990.  All interested contractors are asked to submit their capabilities statement to meet the requirements of this action with all skill categories. All capabilities statement must be submitted to Ms. Anne Behne no later than 11:00 AM, March 17, 2009 at anne.behne@dtra.mil.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
Pursuant to FAR 15.201(e)
USDA Forest Service
Washington Office Fire and Aviation Management
Still and Video Photography

NAICS CODE: 541922 – Photography Services

DESCRIPTION:	
The USDA Forest Service Washington Office Fire and Aviation Management program is conducting market research to determine whether there is sufficient interest among professional still and video photographers in shooting wildland fires, prescribed fires, and wildland/prescribed fire related activities and events to establish “call when needed” contracts.  

Still and video photographers are needed to shoot photographs and video of wildland and prescribed fires burning in forests and on rangelands; wildland fire crews engaged in suppression actions, including, but not limited to, digging firelines, operating fire engines and hoses, rappelling out of helicopters, parachuting out of fixed wing aircraft, protecting structures, and conducting burn-outs and backfires; helicopters and fixed wing aircraft dropping water or fire retardant on wildland fires. 
	
Still and video photographers must meet the following criteria:

1.  Still and video photographers must be professional photographers whose primary occupation is shooting photographs and videotape.  The USDA Forest Service will not establish contracts with any still or video photographers who shoot photographs and videotapes as a secondary business or a hobby.

2.  Still and video photographers must have taken within the last three years or be willing to take a week-long basic wildland firefighter training course to ensure that they understand the subject matter and that they, in the company of other firefighters or working alone with permission, do not endanger themselves or others while shooting photographs or videotape on wildland fires or prescribed fires.  The USDA Forest Service will not charge or compensate still and video photographers for attending this course, which will be held in the spring of 2010 at various locations across the country.

3.  Still and video photographers must have the capability to shoot photographs and videotapes on very short (often 24 to 48 hours) notice; to travel to remote forest locations by personal vehicle or government conveyance; to endure high temperatures and smoke; to follow instructions from senior fire managers assigned to assist them; to hike for moderate to long distances in steep terrain carrying gear needed for safety, sustenance, and to perform the work; and to shoot from fixed wing aircraft or helicopters.

4.  Still photographers must have the capability to provide the USDA Forest Service with high resolution digital images as RAW files greater than 10 megabytes (at least 300 dpi and at least 3 inches x 2 inches in size) as well as printed thumbnail indexes.  Video photographers must have the capability to provide the USDA Forest Service with digital video files that meet industry standards for broadcast television (including high definition images if HD is the chosen format).

5.  Still and video photographers must have the capability to shoot both landscapes and people in high contrast situations of extreme brightness and shadow, at night, and working around firefighters in action.

6.  Portfolios are required and will be judged by peers and agency officers (photo web sites are considered portfolios – photographers may present digital light boxes for reference, for example).

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government from an ultimate acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. Requests for solicitation will not receive a response. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any input as a result of this market survey. The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this market survey.
The Indian Head Division Naval Surface Warfare Center is seeking potential sources, pricing and scheduling for the design, manufacture and installation/training of a pelletizing system.  The system will be used in Indian Head Division's pilot scale propellant processing facility.
The system shall continuously extrude, pelletize and collect propellant grains from a 4-in vertical press. The press discharge is approximately 50-inches above the ground.  The ram rate is typically operated between 0.5-in/min to 1.0-in/min.  The average density of the propellant is 1.5-g/cc.  The available footprint for the pelletizing system is seven feet wide by fourteen feet long.  The equipment shall comply with Hazardous Location Class I, Division 1 Groups C & D and Class II, Division 1 Groups E, F and G.  The following utilities are provided at the building; electric 110V & 220V, potable and non-potable water, air pressure up to 90psi.  Since the operating facility is used for multiple programs the system shall be capable of being installed and removed easily e.g. casters, leveling feet.  
The pelletizing system shall be operated remotely from another building.  It shall be integrated with the existing Allen Bradley SLC500.  Due to safety requirements no personnel are allowed in the operating building while the press is running.  The system shall be capable of stopping operations and resuming them safely after shutdown.  The system shall be designed for ease of cleaning and disassembly.  Only sanitary or pharmaceutical grade connections will be allowed.  
The die should be capable of handling pressures of up to 9,000-psig (that is 3,000-psig hydraulic).  The typical hydraulic pressure during normal extrusion operations is between 1,800 and 2,000-psig.  The die should be designed such that no stagnation of material occurs inside the die.  The manufacturer shall supply the 3-D drawings of the die to Indian Head Division.  Engineering procedures for assembling, disassembling, cleaning and operating the system should also be included as well as system oversight during an inert extrusion run.  
The system should be capable of producing and handling pellets between 0.015 and 0.050-in in diameter.  The die should be designed so that multiple diameter die inserts could be used for different geometry requirements.  The system should also be capable of collecting the pellets for post processing operations such as screening and drying.  If water is used for transporting grains the system should be capable of reusing the water in a closed system.  The force applied between the cutter blades and the die face should be adjustable and known.     All interested sources shall provide a summary of their company's capabilities including organization name, address, calibration processes, inspection capability, personnel, and past experience. It is also required to provide a point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number, and CAGE Code.
All responding sources must email their response submissions no later than February 15, 2010 to:

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to search for qualified vendors capable of implementing and completing a performance evaluation plan related to the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Health Community Pilot projects (NOTE: This is not a solicitation to identify VLER Health Communities).The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) have been partnering to meet the President's April 09, 2009 mandate that "Both Departments [VA and DoD] will work together to define and build a system that will ultimately contain administrative and medical information from the day an individual enters military service throughout their military career, and after they leave the military."  The VLER Health Communities Initiative is the first necessary step for the implementation and refinement of VLER.  VA and DOD have just selected the first VLER Health Community and will be selecting an additional 2 - 4 communities in the next couple of months and intend to select a total of 4 - 6 communities to begin implementation this fiscal year.VLER Health Communities aim to pilot test the exchange of health data between VA and DoD and private sector partners via the Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) with the goal of informing direct care provision and tracking and improving patient outcomes across all sites of care.  VLER Health Communities (VHCs) will be evaluated with respect to cost and quality outcomes, following a Performance Evaluation Plan that is currently under development. The evaluation plan will be provided to the contractor.  The contractor shall implement and complete this plan which will include evaluating the VHCs to assess the completeness of data in the summary of care records and the contribution of non-VA summary records.  The contractor may be required to travel to any or all of the VHCs during contract performance. The locations of the VHCs will be provided at the time of contract award and may be anywhere within the Continental United States. The contractor shall have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to assess the effect that access to patients' summary of care records has on provider workflow and quality of care.  The contractor shall have the capacity to provide key personnel with experience and knowledge in the following areas:"	Health Care Systems and Health Information Exchange (e.g., thorough knowledge of private and public health care systems; experience working in a health care system; understanding of technical requirements for health information exchange between private and public sector partners)"	Program evaluation and performance measurement (e.g., previous program evaluation experience focusing on new and/or innovative health care administration practices, health standards and standards development, health structure, process and outcomes models and process and outcomes measures development, data analysis)"	Statistical and Research Methodologies"	Program or Project Management Approach (e.g., ability to develop and maintain a formal project plan and schedule in accordance with established project management processes as defined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge; demonstrated ability to execute a project plan using established processes; ability to create and deliver formal presentations to VA management and executive leadership and VA stakeholders; ability to produce well written, organized and succinct reports; ability to manage competing priorities and to adjust quickly and efficiently to changes in work direction)The expected period of performance is to begin in April 2010.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to be for 3 years - 1 base year contract with 2 option years, pending availability of funds.This market research is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this market research will be the outcome of the competitive process.

<a href="mailto:steve.streeter@us.army.mil">RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick R&D (RDECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>Introduction: Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Warfighter Science, Technology, and Applied Research Directorate (WarSTAR) at the Natick Soldier Research, Development, & Engineering Center, intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: BYK Gardner Incorporated, a small business located in Columbia, MD 21046.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR>BYK-Gardner USA manufactures a unique optical haze measurement instrument in the Haze Gard Dual that is designed with an open sample area which allows for the testing of full-size eyewear lenses in transmission mode (thru the lens). The unique features also include the desired ability for instrument self-diagnosis, reference beam, ability to export data to a computer, and fully enclosed optics for accurate haze readings in a compact bench-top instrument.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR>Other haze measuring instruments either work oniy in reflectance-mode (bouncing a beam of light off the surface of the sample) or do not include a large enough sampling area to insert full-size eyewear goggles for transmission-mode haze evaluation. This Haze Gard Dual has capability of measuring in both compensation and non-compensation methods, which are two different international standard methods. This is the oniy instrument that has capability of measuring these two methods.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR>An internet search of the haze meter market was performed identifying several makers of portable handheld haze meter instruments that only work in reflectance mode. None of those reflectance based instruments would fit Natick's technical needs. Also, there is no other instrument capable of measuring two different test methods according to the two international specifications.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR>As mentioned above, BYK Haze Gard Dual also capable of measuring total transmittance and transmission haze according to two international specifications (IS0 13468 and ASTM D 1003) which can be very useful for research purposes.<BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:<BR>None<BR><BR>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to:  steve.streeter@us.army.mil no later than noon on January 19, 2010.<BR><BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center -  Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Steven Streeter, Contract Specialist (508) 233-5704<BR>steve.streeter@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF), Office of Legislative and Public Affairs (OLPA), intends to partner with Finger Lakes Productions International (FLPI) to promote NSF-funded science research via  a FLPI-initiated and based, nationally coordinated, online science portal.

Finger Lakes Productions International (FLPI) is a national leader in the production and distribution of environmental and science-based media.  FLPI is uniquely positioned for this partnership due to a singular collaboration with PBS and WETA public media to create a new multimedia science portal. This prototype would be used as a demonstration model for public television websites throughout the country.

Since FLPI has ownership over the protytpe they will then work with NSF to promote this model, which aligns public media stations with research institutions and researchers for the purposes of educating citizens, young and old, about the importance of science and environmental research and discovery.

The period of performance will be the date of award through one year.

The proposed contract action is for services for which the govenment intends to sponsor with only one source.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  This notice is for information purposes only.  See Numbered Note 22 (changing 45 days to 5 days).

Facilitation services by RurAL CAP are for effective sharing of information between tribal participants and NMFS resulting in a research plan that has given thorough consideration of subsistence and community issues. RurAL CAP was identified by the program office as the only vendor who can perform this work. RurAL CAP holds a specialized and unique skill set based on previous experience and expertise facilitating native participation in federal decision-making processes related to fisheries management. RurAL CAP's past facilitations have successfully produced native and western cultural participants understanding of each other's perspectives on complex fisheries issues. In addition, RurAL CAP is one of the nation's "community action agencies" (CAA) and is the only CAA in Alaska. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. <br /><br />However, firms that believe they can provide the same level of services that fully meets the government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.

<a href="mailto:wanda.c.carter-davis@usace.army.mil">US Army Corps of Engineer - Omaha District</a>
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District, intends to negotiate a contract with the State of Iowa, Department of Natural Resource (IDNR)  under the authority of FAR 6.302-1,only one source can satisfy agency requirement, to perform Scientific Services to support Pallid Sturgeon Recovery on the Missouri River. The proposed contract will be an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity type contract for a period of five years not to exceed $3,000,000.00. Work will be assigned by negotiated firm-fixed price task orders. The impetus for this work is a result of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2000 Biological Opinion on the Operation of the Missouri River Main Stem Reservoir System, Operation and Maintenance of the Missouri River Bank Stabilization and Navigation Project, Operation of the Kansas River Reservoir System, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2003 Amendment to the 2000 Biological Opinion on the Operation of the Missouri River Main Stem Reservoir System. Within the BiOp, there is a multifaceted Reasonable and Prudent Alternative (RPA) for the pallid sturgeon addressing various components to ensure that the continued operations of the USACE on the Missouri River main stem and Kansas River do not jeopardize the continued existence of the pallid sturgeon.  The Missouri River Recovery Program (MRRP) implements management actions to avoid any further harm to the listed species and eventually recover them from their degraded state  The MRRP works closely with state management agencies to facilitate progress toward meeting  program requirements, as well as fulfilling their public trust responsibilities. As an extension of those natural resource management responsibilities, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) has developed a Missouri River program which monitors and tracks pallid sturgeon and other native fish species.  In developing this program to fulfill their public trust responsibility, IDNR has acquired significant expertise in the area of Missouri River knowledge, pallid sturgeon biology, pallid sturgeon propagation, pallid habitat use, as well as a significant infrastructure for managing and conducting monitoring and research activities on the Missouri River As one of the leading experts in pallid biology and sampling technology, IDNR has been a partner in the development of the MRRP and has designed and conducted scientific evaluations on the Missouri River in conjunction with the multiple disciplines of the overall MRRP.  In a proactive and collaborative manner, IDNR has participated in workgroups and project teams, and has developed and implemented a variety of monitoring and research projects on the Missouri River and tributaries including participation in the establishment of the Standard Operating Procedures for Fish Sampling and Data Collection on the Missouri River and the Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment Program (PSPAP).  The PSPAP and other MRRP fishery studies rely on data consistency, quality, and integrity from year to year in order to detect changes in trends over time. The IDNR possesses the required biological collectors permits,  including endangered species permits for federally listed pallid sturgeon, to conduct these types of highly specialized biological assessments.  Due to the uniqueness of this Scope of Work, the required permits, the sampling requirements, IDNR possesses the required expertise and the full range of equipment necessary to perform the work; IDNR has unique knowledge of the Missouri River and tributaries encompassed by the MRRP which results in increased efficiency and data quality.<BR>IDNR has accumulated knowledge and expertise on this project that is not available from any other firm. It would be costly to the Government, both financially and technically, to develop a new contractors knowledge base of the pallid sturgeon recovery program. Interested concerns should contact Wanda Carter-Davis at 402 995-2059 or by email at wanda.c.carter-davis@usace.army within fifteen days of publication of this notice, to submit documentation demonstrating their capability and qualifications to accomplish the proposed work under this contract.<BR>

<a href="mailto:yolanda.cotten@va.gov">Contracting Specialist</a>
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCEThe Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, intends to negotiate a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source to Cortech Solutions for a 64-channel upgrade to the existing 64-channel Biosemi ActiveTwo EEG System. There is no other known source in the United States that can provide this equipment. A firm fixed price contract with no option years is anticipated and shall be awarded. It is the Governments belief that only the proposed candidate possesses the required capabilities to successfully meet this requirement. It is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate only with this source.This is not a request for proposal.  However, companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include technical, specifications of their product, pass performance information, price and delivery time.  This information will be reviewed by the Government technical representatives for consideration for future requirements.  Email statements are preferred.  Statements are due no later than January 19, 2010.  Phone inquiries will not be accepted.This is not a solicitation; it is a Notice of Intent to Sole Source requirement.JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.VA BOSTON Healthcare System, Research Service2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.Sole Source procurement of a 64-channel upgrade to an existing 64-channel Biosemi ActiveTwo EEG system, bringing the total number of channels to 128, plus miscellaneous lab equipment.3.	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value).  All parts, software support and upgrades, and labor.The following items will be procured: the 64 channel hardware (to be added to the existing 64 channels), 128 channel electrode caps, photocell sensor for synchronizing visual stimuli to EEG recordings, sound level meter with earphone coupler (for calibrating auditory stimuli), electromagnetic field tester (for minimizing environmental electrical noise that interferes with EEG recordings), labor involved in reconfiguring existing hardware and electrode caps, and shipping. The 64 channel upgrade cost is $30,862 the lab calibration equipment $1,443 and shipping is $425.4.	Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.FAR   6.302-1, USC 253(C) (1)  5.	Demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.This vendor is the sole US distributor of Biosemi products. Biosemi is a German company. The upgrade and other equipment can only work with a Biosemi system, so there are no other vendors.6.	Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FedBizOps notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.A sole source notice will be published in FedBizOps.gov.7.	Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable.The anticipated cost or price to the government for this contract action is determined to be fair and reasonable. 8.	Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.I went to the Biosemi website and found that Cortech Solutions was the only US distributor of their products.9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.This EEG system will be used for recording high-frequency (gamma) brainwaves from patients (chronic schizophrenics) and healthy control subjects.  The nature of the research requires that a dense electrode array (64 channels) be used for accurate topographic mapping and source localization.  While traditional low-impedance EEG systems can provide a high signal-to-noise ratio, which is critical for measuring gamma brainwaves, the electrode application procedure used with these systems is burdensome and tedious for subjects, especially patients.  Each electrode location must be cleaned by abrading the skin, a process which is uncomfortable and can take a long time.  For dense electrode arrays, electrode application can take more then 30 minutes, particularly for patients whose hair may not be clean.  Also, traditional electrode caps are not very comfortable for subjects.In recent years, high-impedance EEG systems have been developed which have claimed to reduce the time of the electrode application process.  However, these systems have suffered from low signal-to-noise ratios, which makes them poorly-suited for recording gamma brainwaves.The ActiveTwo EEG system is the only high-impedance EEG system that can provide 1) a high signal-to-noise ratio; 2) fast setup time; and 3) improved subject comfort.  What makes this system unique is that it utilizes state-of-the-art active electrode recording technology, so that no skin abrasion is necessary.  The high signal-to-noise ratio is made possible by using fiber optics and battery-powered electronics.  After the cap is fitted, each electrode position is filled with a small amount of gel (smaller than with traditional systems).  Our experience with this system has shown that electrode application for the ActiveTwo takes less than half the time required for a traditional system.  Furthermore, our subjects greatly prefer the ActiveTwo electrode cap to the traditional cap, as it is lighter and more comfortable to wear.  Since the electrode application process is shorter and more enjoyable, our subjects perform better and have a much more enjoyable experience in the laboratory.For all of these reasons, the ActiveTwo EEG system is the ideal EEG system for our research.  It is also important to note that it is important to purchase this particular system for collaborations between this laboratory and EEG labs at the Bedford and Brockton VA campuses.  These labs use the same system and therefore collaborating with them would not be possible without it.10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.No other vendors of this equipment exist.11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.Contracting Activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.

All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort.

This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<DESC>Reference Number: NHLBI-PB-EB-2010-61-JKS

Title: 	Chameleon Ultra II Laser System

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION NOTICE.   This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   
The reference solicitation number is:   NHLBI-PB-EB-2010-35-JKS.

This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).

This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures in accordance with FAR 13.3 Simplified Acquisition Methods, and FAR Part 13.5

The resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-038.  The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $5 million.  

The acquisition is being conducted as a full and open competition with no restrictions. The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 334413 and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), intends to award a fixed priced purchase order for the purchase of Biological Products listed below.

The Government’s anticipated delivery date is five (5) days after receipt of purchase order.

The Government’s acceptance terms and FOB point are the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Bethesda, Maryland.     

The purpose of the proposed acquisition is for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) to negotiate and award a brand name or equal justified contract on an un-restricted, competitive basis for Chameleon Ultra II Laser System.  Qualified organizations that can provide a Chameleon Ultra II Laser System to the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) are needed.  This system is a tunable two photon laser source for a widefield two photon excitation scope and a multiphoton selective plane illumination microscope (SPIM) is required.  For both applications, the source must provide as high an output power as possible, in order to achieve the maximum two-photon excitation efficiency.  The laser must also be wavelength tunable over a broad range, in order to ensure to properly photoactivate and then excite the fluorescently-labeled samples.  The Chameleon Ultra II is the only laser that satisfies these requirements, as it is tunable over a broad spectral range (680-1080 nm), and offers more power than competing vendors.  The Chameleon Ultra II meets the following required specifications:

Performance Specifications
-Output average power specification required is >3.3 Watt at peak of Ti:S curve, with a tuning range of 680nm to 1080nm range.  Capabilities are required across this entire tuning range to cover our current and future experiments.
-Capability for rapid wavelength changes, 40 nm/sec.
-Beam quality to specified as M2<1.1 to ensure tightest focusing capability
-Beam shape specified as better than (i.e. smaller range) ellipticity = 0.9-1.1.  A round beam ensures more efficient coupling of light from the laser into the microscope and minimal astigmatism.
-Minimum tuning range required is 680nm-1080nm inclusive without operator adjustments other than request of wavelength.  System to tune through atmospheric absorption bands > 900 nm without requirement of external gas purge.
-Pulse width approximately 140fSec, important for minimizing dispersion in applications.
-System shall have the lowest noise specifications to provide optimal images.  A noise spec of 0.5%, or less, is required.

Design
-Optimized pulse width for maximum multi-photon excitation in a typical confocal microscope.  Pulse width must typically be between 120-140fSec across the full tuning range to minimize optical pulse stretching (also called “dispersion” or “chirp”) in the laboratory’s microscope and thus give minimum pulse width and highest peak power and highest multi-photon conversion efficiency at the sample.  In order to assure minimum chirping, output pulse must be very close to the bandwidth limit.  Systems with pulse width under 100fSec are unacceptable because they have too much bandwidth and thus exhibit large pulse chirping.  Typically these short-pulse systems attempt to use excess average power to make up for pulse stretching; however, excess average power will induce more photo-damage in the laboratory’s biological samples.  To further ensure minimum pulse chirp, pulse width must be actively controlled and optimized across full tuning range.
-Hermetically-sealed construction.  Diode pumped laser systems generally degrade due to optical contamination from dust and solvents present in the lab.  It is required that the system be hermetically sealed to provide long life and minimal downtime.  Required for hermetic sealing is no exchange of gas, or dust from the lab, as evidenced by no light leakage from the interior cavity.
-Permanent alignment of head.  The laboratory focus is on laser microscopy, as opposed to basic laser research.  It is required that the design of the laser be of permanent alignment, with no ports for dist invasion, and no field alignment requirements in order to meet project deadlines.
-Design that minimizes downtime.  The Ti:S oscillator cavity must be constructed with a single-tuning-element design to eliminate all needs for adjustment, optimization, or cleaning the system.  System must include a closed-loop air filtration and recirculation unit to ensure that the cavity is free from out-gassing components, micro-dust particles, and water vapor.  System must be able to maintain less that 1% humidity at all times without external purging or other intervention.
-User-replaceable pump diodes.  Because pump diodes are the single greatest maintenance cost, diodes must be user replaceable and can be changed without the involvement of the laser head, or disturbance of any kind to the experimental set up.  Disruptions of this kind, for example, to re-thread the optical fiber through the umbilical can be avoided.
-Low noise.  Amplitude noise of the system is critical in many small signal applications.  Thus the Ti:S is pumped by a single-frequency/single-longitudinal mode pump source so that the noise spectrum will be free of chaotic noise behavior characteristic of multimode pump sources.
-Integrated spectrometer.  System has an onboard spectrometer capable of monitoring wavelength and bandwidth of Ti:S laser.  Spectrometer to be addressable via USB.
-Ultra-quiet Chiller.  System has a chiller that is all solid-state design.  Freon pump-type refrigeration units should not be acceptable as they are noisier and create greater waste heat and mechanical vibrations.  Furthermore, the chiller has the capability to be remoted up to 8 meters away for ultimate noise/heat suppression.
-System Control.  System should be user controllable either via RS232 or via the panel interface located on the power supply.

<p>Justification for Brand Only: "MATLAB is a mathematical analysis and processing package used by many of the PSD researchers in their day-to-day research. It is considered the de-facto standard for matrix manipulation and certain types of mathematical analysis. PSD currently has 20 floating (i.e. network accessible) licenses for the MATLAB program, along with a number of licenses for auxiliary (toolbox) software. While and open source equivalent does exist, PSD scientists have found significant differences between programs written for MATLAB and those that work in the open-source equivalents." NOAA has "downloaded and installed various open-source and freely available alternatives to the MATLAB package", but ran "into compatibility issues with existing legacy code with all these packages."</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: This posting is to inform about the Sole Source purchase of one year Business Network membership to Sante Fe Institute of Science DBA Sante Fe Institute. The U. S. Naval War College has a requirement for a one-year membership in the Santa Fe Institute, a non-profit research organization that uses multidisciplinary collaboration to study behavior and structure of complex systems, with emphasis on complex systems that exhibit adaptation and learning. The Institute brings together Nobel laureates and top academic researchers in fields such as anthropology, economics, biology, and physics to study complex systems. Santa Fe Institute's research into computer simulation systems builds on a broad base of studies in complex adaptive systems.  The simulation programs, and more general computational approaches, are built on the concept of adaptive agents capable of learning in response to experience.  Many of the approaches incorporate processes that mimic biological systems and organisms, including mutation, generic crossover, evolution and co-evolution, and differential retention of successful genotypes. Areas of work include use of genetic algorithms, classifier systems, neural networks, genetic programming and other related machine learning methods. This award will provide CNO-Strategic Studies Group (CNO-SSG) participation in the Santa Fe Institute Business Network for Complex Systems Research for a period of one year.  Naval War College representatives will participate in research visits, workshops, technical meetings and seminars, and receive copies of working papers and books resulting from these research programs.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

<DESC>12/23/2009 - The following is a question submitted and the answer:
Q1:  Is this a follow on requirement?  If yes, can you provide incumbent information?
A1:  This is a new requirement, and therefore, this is no incumbent.

1/7/2010:  The following are questions submitted and the answers:

Q1.  How much work can be expected?  For example, can you give us an idea of how many jobs per week will be required in New York and elsewhere?  If there are no projected numbers, can you provide us with the figures from last year?
A1.  The SEC’s New York Regional Office estimates that there will be approximately 125 depositions per year totaling approximately $100,000 per year.  We expect that the majority of depositions, at least 95%, will be done in New York City.

Q2.  Must the suggested pricing format be followed, or may we deviate to offer a unique pricing structure?
A2.  You may deviate from the pricing format provided in the attachment, but the more you deviate, the harder it will be for the SEC to evaluate and compare your prices.

Q3.  Can you provide a breakdown of expected locations for this work; specifically the most common deposition locations?
A3. A majority of the depositions, at least 95%, are expected to take place in New York City (NY).  Other possible locations are Long Island (NY), New Jersey, Upstate New York (NY) and Connecticut.

Q4.  Does the reference to “transcription services” as covered by this solicitation include transcription from existing audio recordings as well as providing live court reporters for depositions, or is all of the work to be performed by a live stenographer?
A4.  “Transcription Services” covered by this solicitation refer to providing live court reporters/stenographers for depositions.

Q5.  Can you clarify (vi) section D – what is meant by “administrative means for NYRO staff to order and pay for transcripts of depositions where reporting services were provided for by a contractor obtained by defense counsel”?  Is the contractor who receives this BPA required to coordinate with other court reporting companies retained by the SEC’s opposing counsel regarding the SEC’s receipt of transcripts and payment for them?
A5.  In various litigations, the defendants may use a deposition reporting service other than the deposition report service provider that the SEC uses.  The SEC would like its deposition reporter services to obtain the transcript from the other reporting service and provide the transcript to the SEC and bill the SEC through the existing contract.  If this is not a commercial practice of your firm, please state so in your quote response.

Q6.  Can you provide the name of the current agency or agencies that hold(s) this contract, and what year they are performing of their contract plus options?  (i.e., the current RFP shows 1 "base year" with options for years 1 through 4.  I'm trying to find out: did the NYRO exercise all or part of the 4 option years after the base year for the current contractor(s)?
A6.  This is a new requirement.  There are no Blanket Purchase Agreements currently in place.

Q7.  If the current contract holder is not currently performing in option year 4, can you provide the reason that the NYRO has opened this contract up for bid at this time, as opposed to continuing your option with the current contract holder (i.e., are you looking for a lower rate, were you unhappy with their performance, did the current contract holder ask to be released?, etc.)?  If the current contract holder is performing in option year 4, can you advise if the current contract holder is listed as an "interested vendor" to rebid on the current solicitation? 
A7.  This is a new requirement.  There are no Blanket Purchase Agreements currently in place.

Q8.  Can you provide an idea of the historic volume of services requested under the previous contract in an annual period?  Can you give either exact figures or an estimate of how many pages each deposition was - and/or the length of time each deposition generally lasts - whichever is easier for you to ascertain? (For example, it may be 100 depositions with each one lasting one hour, or 100 depositions with each one lasting 7 hours.  In the alternative, it may be 50 depositions were 50 pages or less, 25 were 150 pages or less and 25 depositions were 300 pages or less.  These would be quite different scenarios.).  Any way it is easiest for you to express the historic volume would be greatly appreciated.
A8.  This is a new requirement.  There are no Blanket Purchase Agreements currently in place, and therefore, there is no historic information available. 

Q9.  Further to the question 8 above, can you advise how many of each of these depositions were ordered "regular delivery," how many were ordered "Next Day," how many were ordered "Expedite," how many were ordered using "Rough ASCII" and how many were ordered using "Real-time?"
A9.  This is a new requirement.  There are no Blanket Purchase Agreements currently in place, and therefore, there is no historic information available.  

Q10.  Can you advise how many depositions were held that a transcript was
not requested to be transcribed for same? 
A10.  This is a new requirement.  There are no Blanket Purchase Agreements currently in place, and therefore, there is no historic information available.  

Q11.  Further to question 10 above- there is no CLIN for a transcript that has not been transcribed.  Can you advise how this service would be billed if it occurs (if it will never occur, that would answer this question as well)?  
A11. The SEC does not anticipate a need for transcripts that have not been transcribed.

Q12.  Can you advise how many depositions were also ordered videotaped historically?
A12. This is a new requirement.  There are no Blanket Purchase Agreements currently in place, and therefore, there is no historic information available.  

Q13.  Can you advise how many depositions historically required the LEF Exhibit Linking service (either by number of deposition days or by number of exhibits - whichever is easier for you to ascertain?). 
A13.  This is a new requirement.  There are no Blanket Purchase Agreements currently in place, and therefore, there is no historic information available.  

Q14.  Historically, has the NYRO made additional copies of transcripts
for their own in-house use or to provide to co-counsel or opposing counsel?
A14.  No.  Occasionally, NYRO is ordered to provide a pro se defendant with copies of a transcript.  This is a rare occurrence.

Q15.  There is no CLIN for a default (if court reporter arrives on site and the deposition is canceled) or for "late cancellation" (If deposition is canceled after 5:00 PM the previous business day of the schedule deposition).  Does this mean there is no payment if either of these instances occur?
A15.  If your firm’s standard commercial practice is to charge for “default” or “late cancellation,” include the pricing and information (i.e. what constitutes default or late cancellation) in your quote.

Q16.  There is also no CLIN for a daily minimum transcript charge.  (For a deposition that goes forward, but due to minimal pages generates revenue of less than a given amount - usually $100.00).  Does this mean there is no minimum transcript amount to be paid? 
A16.  If your firm’s standard commercial practice is to charge for a daily minimum transcript charge, include the pricing and information in your quote.

Q17.  Although the SOW asks for ASCII files, it does not specify the Means of delivery.  Would the delivery of ASCII files via email be allowed under this contract? 
A17. Yes, delivery of ASCII files via email will be allowed under the Blanket Purchase Agreements(s).

Q18.  Can you explain what the term "unrestricted acquisition" means in relation to this contract (item number iv of the solicitation)?
A18.  Unrestricted acquisition refers to the business size of firms responding to this request for quote.  This acquisition is not restricted to a specific sized business.  

Q19.  Can you give a description of what type of transcript services would be ordered under this contract other than depositions?  (i.e., would transcription of audio tapes or wav files be requested, or court reporting services to be provided at meetings, hearings, arbitrations,  etc.).
A19.  This procurement is only for transcript services of depositions.

Q20.  In item vi, I'm unsure about the difference between "video depositions" and "dvd depositions" does this mean that for depositions that are considered "video depositions"  that a VHS tape would be provided and for depositions that are considered "dvd depositions" that a DVD of the proceedings would be provided?  
A20.  Video depositions refers to the recording of the deposition and dvd refers to the physical recording.  The SEC would prefer the physical recording delivered in dvd form.  However, if your firm’s standard commercial practice is different, please include the pricing and information in your quote.

Q21.  Further to question 15 above, (if both VHS tapes and DVD's of videotapes may be requested), I note there is only one CLIN for video service.  Does this mean that both of these services must be billed at the same rate, or may we include one rate for videotapes and one rate for DVD's under this same CLIN?
A21.  The SEC does not anticipate ordering VHS tapes of depositions.

Q22.  The SOW doesn't mention the amount of notice contractor will receive for engagement of services (i.e., will we be given 48 hours notice to provide services, etc.). 
A22.  Please include your standard commercial practice for the amount of notice you require for engagement of services in your response.  If there is a fee associated with “expedited” service, please include that information.

Q23.  Although the SOW specifically asks for the ability to provide "audio services of depositions" (item vi, C.), there is no CLIN for providing audio recording services.   Does this mean that contractor may not bill for this service?
A23.  The SEC does not anticipate a need for audio services of depositions.  We do however, expect that the video recordings will include audio.

Q24.  Can you provide an example of what digital media format you
would like provided for the NYRO staff to edit video and audio clips of depositions?  (If there is a specific software you currently use, or a file extension you would like this provided in)?  This is under item vi, C. 
A24.  NYRO is familiar with DVDs that work with the Depoview 5 program which allows viewing of videos linked to transcripts, and the expert of video and transcript clips to other programs, such as Powerpoint. 

Q25.  Can you give an example of what you mean by "administrative means" for the NYRO to order and pay for transcripts noticed by defense counsel?  (i.e., is this an on-line solution you're looking for, or a description of the manual procedure of how orders can be taken)? 
A25.  NYRO is flexible and is looking for a feasible and consistent means to order and pay for transcripts noticed by defense counsel.  Please see A5 response above for additional information.

Q26.  Is there a particular means of security that you prefer for security of  transcripts, video and dvd depositions and archives of work products?  (Item vi, F).  In other words - particular software you prefer, or stated procedures you prefer? 
A26.  No particular security is needed as long as it is clear that only the parties to a litigation can order the transcripts and video and non-parties are not allowed to order such material without consent of all the parties in the litigation or court order.

Q27.  The SOW specifically states that "The Government intends to award multiple BPAs ." (item ix, paragraph 1), but also states in paragraph 3 of the same item: ."the Government reserves the right to award a BPA to one (1) quoter."  Can you advise what factors would be taken account to award a contract to one quoter?  In other words - what are the criterion the government would look for that would make it most advantageous to award to one quoter (price, experience, nationwide service, etc.)?  
A27.  In accordance with paragraph (ix) of the notice, the Government intends to award based on price, past performance and quality.

Q28.  I note that FAR Clause 52.232-33 "Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer" is checked. Does this mean that payment will be made by EFT for all invoices under this contract? 
A28.  Payment will be made by Electronic Funds Transfer for all invoices under the Blanket Purchase Agreement(s).

Q29.  Regarding payment terms.  Can you advise how many days after receipt of invoices the NYRO historically makes payment?  
A29.  Payment terms are Net 30.  The SEC strives to make payment within 30 days after receipt of a valid invoice in accordance with FAR 52.212-4(i)(2) Prompt Payment.

Q30.  Historically, is one invoice required per service request (per deposition), or is a cumulative monthly invoice requested for all services requested during that month?
A30.  The SEC expects one invoice per deposition.  If this is not your standard commercial practice, include that information in your quote.

Q31.  Can you advise any sort of monthly or quarterly reports or other
obligations (other than the creation of invoices) is required under this contract? 
A31.  There will be no monthly or quarterly reports or other obligations required under Blanket Purchase Agreement(s).

Q32.  Can you advise the gamut of the types of litigation handled under this contract?  Is it all securities litigation, or are matters also handled by the NYRO of more internal nature (such as employment issues, etc.).
A32.  Deposition Reporting and Transciption services under the Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) will be related to securities litigation.

<p><br /><br />HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]</p>
<p>(a) Prohibitions.</p>
<p>Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;</p>
<p>(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>**************************************************************************************************
The following constitutes amendment 2 of Solicitation HHM402-10-R-0013. These are questions and answers. The deadline for proposals is 1 PM EST on Tuesday, January 26, 2010. Please email all correspondence to Mishelle.Miller@dia.mil.


Q9. Section I.4 FOCI, page 12-13 of 56: Must prime offerors and/or proposed subcontractors submit the completed SF 328 if is not applicable to the company? In what Volume should this be included?
A9. As stated in Section I.4 of the Solicitation, all Offerors shall submit SF 328, Certificate of Foreign Interest. Each Offeror may include SF 328 in Volume V, Security.

Q10. Does the DoL Service Contract Act apply to this solicitation?
A10. No, the Service Contract Act does not apply.

Q11. Section L.4.1, Submission of Electronic Files:  Will the Government accept PDF and/or MS Excel file formats?
A11. Yes, please submit electronic files as PDF, Excel, or MS Word.

Q12. Section L.4.2 Page Limits:  Please consider excluding the Table of Contents and List of Figures/Tables from the page count for each Volume with a page limit.
A12. The page limits stand as stated in Section L, Revised.

Q13. Section M.3.12 Evaluation for Volume IV:  Past Performance M.3.12.1 - Can teammate past performance be used in support of Volume IV?
A13. Yes.

Q14. SF 1449, page 1 of 56:  In which Volume should the completed SF 1449 be included?
A14. The signed SF 1449 may be submitted electronically on its own, separate from any volume.

Q15. SF 1449, page 1 of 56:  Box 15 provides a “Deliver To” postal address although paragraph L.4.1 indicates that the entire proposal shall be submitted electronically.  Please confirm that the Government’s preferred submission method is electronic.
A15. The Government will only accept electronic submissions.

Q16. In which Volume should the completed Representations and Certifications be included?
A16. The Representations and Certifications may be submitted electronically on their own, separate from any volume.

Q17. L.5.3.1 and L.5.4.1:  What is the correct naming convention for Volumes IV and V for companies submitting in both Areas 1 and 2?  (Ex: Company_Area1and2_VolumeIV and Company_Area1and2_VolumeIV)
A17. That is fine, good suggestion.

Q18. Does the Government intend to issue a Task Order upon award of the contract?
A18. Yes.

Q19. L.5.1.2 Contents of Personnel Volume, Section 1 requires identification of Contract Number under which clearance was granted, as well as the COR name and telephone number.  These particular information elements are particularly difficult to identify for each proposed labor candidate.  In many cases, this information is unknown to the candidate or the information may be classified.  May we provide the candidates’ SSN in those cases where we are unable to provide the Contract Number/COR/Telephone?
A19. In Revised Section L, the numbering is off; Original L has L. 5.1.2. Contents of Personnel Volume I: Personnel and the Revised L calls that same section L. 4.4.2. For Contents of Volume I: Personnel, if the information is unknown, state that. Please do not provide candidates' Social Security Number.

Q20. L.5.1.2 Contents of Personnel Volume, Section 2 requires Contract Number, Period of Performance and the Government POC for every work history of each candidate submitted under the proposal.  This information is often unknown to the candidate or the information may be classified.  Would it be acceptable to the Government to enter UNKNOWN or CLASSIFIED if this information is unavailable? 
A20. For the Contents of Personnel Volume, if the information is unknown or classified, please state that.

Q21. In section L.5.1.1 and also L.5.2.1, page counts are specified for both the management and technical volumes. If the offeror intends to bid both SOO areas, does the page count maximums apply to each SOO area individually or does the page count include both volumes together?
A21. I apologize that the limits were not stated clearly. Each volume has its own limit; an Offeror who submits Volume III Technical Proposal for Area 1 is limited to 65 pages and if that same Offeror submits a Volume III for Area 2, that volume is also limited to 65 pages. The Government recognizes that one Offeror who seeks both Areas may submit a combined 130 pages of Volume III. 

Q22. Will the Government accept proposals without a company having a facility clearance first?
A22. Section M. 3.13. Evaluation of Volume V (Security) states: "If the Offeror does not receive a Pass in the Security portion of its proposal, the proposal will not be evaluated further. The Offeror shall provide positive information that it possesses a TS facility clearance as demonstrated by the Offeror's CAGE Code."

Q23. If a company is successful in the bid, will the Govt. sponsor the company for facility clearance?
A23. Please review the entire Solicitation, and see M. 3.13., Q22 and A22. A proposal from company lacking a TS facility clearance will not be evaluated.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (693 Neiman St, Fort Detrick, MD 21702) plans to issue a Request for Proposal on Behalf of the Naval Medical Center, San Diego for laboratory analysis conducted by the clinical team from the Critical Care/Pulmonary Division of the Naval Medical Center, San Diego. The services will be for the laboratory analysis of specimens submitted for the Lung Injury Management Project (research project). The major objective of the project is to determine the levels of markers of oxidative damage, inflamation and antioxidants in frozen sample of serum obtained from patients with acute respiratory illness (ARI). This study is important in order to determine whether alterations in the levels of these biomedical parameters are associated with ARI. 

This study will be performed using stored frozen serum samples from five groups of US military recruits: 1) Recruits diagnosed with acute respiratory illness with normal chest radiographs; 2) Recruits diagnosed with acute respiratory illness with abnormal chest radiographs and negative throat cultures; 3) Recruits diagnosed with acute respiratory illness with abnormal chest radiographs and bacterial pathogen identified by throat culture or PCR;  4) Recruits diagnosed with acute respiratory illness with abnormal chest radiographs and viral pathogen identified by throat culture or PCR; and 5) Normal age and demographic matched healthy controls who do not report to sick call during training. The groups will be compared to determine if there is a difference in levels of markers of inflammation, oxidative damage, and antioxidants between these groups and between acute and convalescent serum. 

The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to conduct this acquisition on an unrestricted full and open competition basis under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by negotiation. The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract for the services.  NAICS 541711

<DESC>Amendment 1 posted, 1/12/2010
In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's Acquisition Management System, 3.2.1.2.12, the Northwest Mountain Region is announcing a solicitation for competitive offers to perform the subject project.
The Federal Aviation Administration, Northwest Mountain Region, intends to award a construction contract for the subject project.  The FAA contemplates award of a firm fixed-price contract.
Estimated contract price is from $100,000 - 250,000. 
Please see attached Request for Offers for proposal submission and evaluation criteria.  
A tiered evaluation of offers will be used in this source selection.  The FAA will evaluate a single tier of offers according to the order of precedence specified in this SIR.  Offers from other than small business concerns will only be considered after the determination that an insufficient number of offers from responsible, small business concerns were received.  At least two qualified offers in a given tier are required in order to consider an award.  If no award can be made at the first tier, the evaluation will proceed to the next higher lettered tier until award can be made.  All responsible, competitive offers in a single tier will be considered equally for award.  The tiered order of precedence for considering offers is (from first to last):
a)	Socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program.b)	Service-disabled veteran owned small business (SDVOSB) and responsible, competitive offers from theprevious tier.c)       Very small businesses and responsible, competitive offers from previous tiers.d)       Small businesses and responsible, competitive offers from previous tiers.e)       Other-than small businesses and responsible, competitive offers from previous tiers.
The NAICS Code for this project is 238210.
This Notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises:  The Department of Transportation (DOT), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, has programs to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire capital and bonding assistance for transportation-related contracts.  This is applicable to any eligible prime or subcontract at any tier.  The DOT Bonding Assistance Program enables firms to apply for bid, payment, and performance bonds up to $1.0 million per contract.  The DOT provides an 80 percent guaranty on the bond amount to a surety against losses.  Loans are also available under the DOT short Term receivable financing.  The maximum line of credit is $750,000.

Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this Request for Information (RFI). Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. 
Responding to this RFI will neither increase nor decrease an information provider’s likelihood of being awarded any contract in the future by FHWA for the requisite services.

The Government is conducting market research to:
Determine what sources exist that are capable of satisfying the Government’s requirements as listed below;
Determine the capabilities of potential contractors;
Determine the size and status of potential sources; and 
Determine the level of competition.

Section 3. Background

The purpose of this Sources Sought announcement is to conduct market research.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) anticipates work will be performed under Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  From time to time, those awarded an IDIQ contract will be invited to compete for award of task orders that may include technical support and assistance for freight management and operations.

The Office of Freight Management and Operations is currently included in an IDIQ for “Technical Support and Assistance for the FHWA’s Office of Operations” .  The Office of Freight Management and Operations is contemplating award of an IDIQ to place greater emphasis on the need for freight expertise.

Section 4.  Nature of Work

A. Background

The Federal Highway Administration is a major agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), a cabinet-level organization of the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government.  FHWA is charged with the broad responsibility of ensuring that America’s roads and highways continue to be the safest and most technologically up-to-date. Although State, local, and tribal governments own most of the Nation’s highways, FHWA provides financial and technical support to them for constructing, improving, and preserving America’s highway system. 

Within the FHWA, the Office of Freight Management and Operations promotes efficient freight movement on the U.S. transportation system and across our borders. Efficient freight movement is important to our nation's economic competitiveness and to our global connectivity.  To advance this mission, the Office: 
•	Conducts policy and applied research 
•	Develops analytical tools and data integration
•	Develops and advances technology applications that improve the efficiency of freight movement 
•	Engages in technology transfer
•	Develops and administers a professional capacity building program that improves the knowledge and ability of transportation professionals to address freight movement 
•	Administers national level programs that address freight movement (e.g.,  Projects of National and Regional Significance, National Corridor Infrastructure Improvement, Freight Intermodal Distribution Pilot, and Truck Parking) 
•	Administers Federal truck size and weight requirements. 
Together, these activities build a greater understanding of freight transportation issues and trends, foster public/private partnerships, improve operations through advanced technologies, and educate and train transportation professionals. 

B.  State of Freight and Challenges 
The projected increase in freight movement over the next twenty plus years will increasingly strain the Nation’s transportation network including intermodal and global connectivity.  Ensuring that freight continues to move efficiently on the US transportation network is critical to the nation’s economic health.  

The economic benefits that accrue at the local, regional and national levels come with challenges that need to be addressed, e.g., emissions, energy consumption, congestion, modal productivity, local costs/benefits relative to more dispersed benefits.  These challenges are not unique to the highway system but present themselves across the transportation network on all modes. 

The movement of freight is a complicated system involving multiple governmental organizations at all levels, private interests that control the assets that move the freight, and, of course, the beneficial owners of the freight itself.  All need to work together to ensure that the transportation system functions effectively and efficiently for all.  

Understanding the dynamics of this movement and the relationship of all the players is necessary for transportation decision makers.  The freight transportation challenge is decidedly different from urban commuting and other passenger travel in several ways:
•	Freight moves long distances through localities and responds to distant economic demands while the majority of passenger travel occurs between local origins and destinations. Freight movement may generate local costs that exceed local benefits. 
•	Freight movements fluctuate more quickly and in greater relative amounts than passenger travel. While both passenger travel and freight respond to long-term demographic change, freight responds more quickly than passenger travel to short-term economic fluctuations. Fluctuations can be national or local. The addition or loss of just one major business can dramatically change the level of freight activity in a locality. 
•	Freight movement is heterogeneous compared to passenger travel. Patterns of passenger travel tend to be very similar across metropolitan areas and among large economic and social strata. The freight transportation demands of farms, steel mills, and clothing boutiques differ radically from one another. Solutions aimed at average conditions are less likely to work because the freight demands of economic sectors vary widely. 
•	Improvements targeted at freight demand are needed as freight accounts for a larger share of the transportation system, and as improvements targeted at general traffic or passenger travel are less likely to aid the flow of freight as an incidental by-product. 

C.   Objectives
As the FHWA’s resource for freight transportation and as a major contributor to US DOT freight policy and programs, the Office of Freight Management and Operations is seeking to identify sources that can provide support services related to:  

1.	Support to staff in understanding freight issues, trends,and market dynamics.

2.	Support to staff in the development and application of technology to more efficiently move freight.

3.	Support to staff in the development of policy, programs, projects, and regulations that advance freight management and operations.

4.	Support to staff for communications activities, including marketing and outreach to raise awareness, understanding, and the application of freight management and operations concepts.

5.	Support to staff for the development and use of data integration, analytic and technical tools, user interfaces, models, and  interactive and asynchronous instruction to advance freight programs.

6.	Support to staff for technology transfer and technical assistance programs to state and local transportation professionals to facilitate application of freight programs.

7.	Support to staff for program assessment of freight programs and projects, including project evaluation, performance measurement, finance, and process improvement related to freight programs.

<DESC>Synopsis:
The Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, is looking for sources to provide training facilities and qualified instructor personnel in support of the Office of Anti Terrorism Assistance.
The US Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Training Directorate, Office of Antiterrorism Assistance (DS/T/ATA) manages the antiterrorism assistance program.  ATA assists foreign partners to develop the capability for antiterrorism planning and coordination and commitment to support US counterterrorism objectives.  This includes coordinating, synchronizing, implementing and expanding training and technical assistance programs; sharing technology with foreign partners; establishing or strengthening alliances and/or agreements, regional partnerships, and security assistance programs; promoting interagency cooperation among foreign government security and law enforcement forces; and supporting exchange programs.
The program’s geographic reach is extensive, having trained over 61,000 foreign police and civilian security officials in over 152 countries since inception in 1983.  Country assistance plans are implemented through advanced training, technical assistance, and equipment grants including computers and software.  Capacity building projects are tailored to the needs of each Partner Nation.
DS/T/ATA requires contractor support for ATA’s specialized foreign assistance mission.  This contract will support the ATA office in conducting foreign law enforcement training and related activities, both domestic and overseas. 
A solicitation will be issued to select multiple ( two) prime contractors. Contractors must be US companies based in the United States.  Contractor will provide overseas and domestic instructor-led training; specialized and advanced technical assistance; domestic training facilities; and training-related support services.  This contract is unclassified.  No facilities security clearances or personal security clearances are required.  While no personal security clearances are required, instructor personnel will require some type of vetting which we expect will be short of what is required for a moderate risk, public trust determination.
ATA has a course portfolio of approximately 50 courses with 325 scheduled events each year.    During any given week, ATA can be conducting 10-20 courses worldwide.  Approximately 85 percent of the courses are taught overseas.  The remaining courses are taught domestically and will required training and support facilities within the 48 contiguous States.
DS anticipates release of a finalized RFP in December 2009 and contract award by the end of March 2010.  

**** NOTE: The anticipated release date for the finalized RFP has been delayed.  The new release date is expected on or before February 1, 2010. ****

Project includes the engineering, design, and permit documentation preparation for a stream channel restoration. Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), NRCS is authorized to restore an historic stream channel near Janet Drive in West Warwick. The existing stream channel is currently routed through a poorly functioning culvert. The culvert outlet is often submerged, restricting the capacity of the culvert and causing repeated upstream flooding to local homeowners. After visiting the site with Town officials, NRCS determined that the preferred alternative is to remove the existing culvert and restore the stream channel and floodplains to their historic regime.

<DESC>Although vendor competition was sought amoung GSA Schedule holders that sell the requested Ricoh SFX2000M Secure Fax, this requirement is classified as non-competitive due to the brand name restriction. The delivery order file was documented with the following rationale for restricting competition to a brand name: 

HHS/OIG requires Ricoh SFX2000M Secure Fax at each Chief Information Security Officer's location to facilitate classified communication at the secret level. Secure Fax works in conjunction with STE (Secure Phone) to provide secure data communication between the Department of Health and Human Services and other OPDIVs in a secure fashion. All OPDIVs are purchasing this Secure Fax to better communicate during security situations that are highly sensitive, secret, or top secret requiring a secure communication line between HHS and other Federal security entities such as NSA, FBI, etc. Ricoh is the sole manufacturer for this type of equipment. 

The following product was purchased:

Ricoh SFX2000M Secure Fax

<MODNBR>P00017_P00015
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN <br />FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p><br />I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>679 ARSS - Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF), 205 West D. Avenue, Eglin AFB, FL 32542<br /><br />II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED</p>
<p>This individual justification and approval (J&amp;A) supports the sole-source acquisition of an effort which will expand the scope of the on-going BLU-122 Study via modification to contract FA8681-08-C-0174. The added scope will broaden the existing study to include contractor analysis, determination of impacts, and conclusions regarding potential changes to the HTVSF design or other changes necessary to meet new requirements identified in the draft Capabilities Development Document (CDD), Version 1.7. This effort will be performed by Alliant Techsystems, Inc. (ATK) in parallel with the contract activities being performed during the HTVSF Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD). This action is necessary to enable the contractor to prepare a realistic proposal for the follow-on risk reduction and/or system development and demonstration (SDD) contract(s). A similar effort will be conducted concurrently by another contractor performing a second JCTD contract under a rolling down-select evaluation process. The results of the study will also assist the Government assessing the cost and schedule impacts of requiring the more stringent HTVSF capabilities, especially the Key Performance Parameter for detecting thinner layers and narrower voids. This acquisition will be performed as a firm fixed price effort with a period of performance extending through 30 April 2010. Paragraph III below addresses the estimated value for this action.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>The HTVSF JCTD is the initial phase of a prospective program to provide increased survivability and void detection capabilities in a fuze system to be integrated onto the BLU-113 and BLU-109 penetrator warheads. The draft CDD adds a requirement to integrate the HTVSF with the BLU-122 warhead. The HTVSF will be capable of surviving up to 15K PSI of reinforced concrete and may be programmed to detonate in a specific void. The JCTD is a risk reduction phase which was intended to demonstrate the required capabilities prior to seeking a Milestone B decision; however, the new CDD requirements may require further risk reduction effort to modify the current fuze design and successfully demonstrate the enhanced capabilities. This expanded study will help the contractor and Government better understand how the requirement changes will impact the fuze design, program cost and schedule, and future acquisition strategy for the HTVSF. The Government estimates the total value of this action to be approximately $649,000.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>The authority for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-l: Only one <br />responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Pursuant to <br />FAR 6.302-1(b)(2), supplies or services are available from only one source in the case of the <br />existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, secret processes, or similar <br />circumstances that would preclude a competitive acquisition, such as involvement in a rolling <br />down-select source selection process.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED <br />ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)<br />Two contractors are concurrently developing, testing, and demonstrating HTVSF capabilities under a rolling down-select evaluation process that will culminate in selection of one contractor to proceed to the following risk reduction and/or SDD phase(s) and eventually into the production phase of the program. Since the JCTD is officially a competitive source selection, release of design specific information required by other contractors would jeopardize the procurement integrity of this acquisition. This study cannot be performed without access to source selection sensitive information which is protected in accordance with FAR 3.104. <br />In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), a sole source award to Alliant Techsystems, Inc. is justified because selection of a contractor other than ATK would require release of source selection sensitive information, a violation of the Procurement Integrity Act and FAR 3.104.</p>
<p>VI. DECRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE</p>
<p>Although this effort cannot be performed by other sources as a prime contract, it may afford opportunities for subcontracts; therefore, the action was synopsized as a FedBizOpps posting on 26 Aug 09. No responses were received by any potential industry sources.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will ensure that the final price of the contracting action awarded under this individual J&amp;A will be fair and reasonable with cost/price analysis conducted in accordance with the guidance contained in FAR Part 15. The appropriate Government personnel will perform a technical evaluation and assessment of cost elements, as appropriate. This office will also request support from the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for audit or rate verification. This action is not expected to exceed $650,000; however, this office will obtain certified cost or pricing data from the contractor if the action meets the threshold established by the Truth and Negotiation Act.<br /><br />VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>Although Market Research was not performed for this specific acquisition due to the competitive nature of the on-going JCTD contract, the contractor has committed to small business goals and is encouraged to seek out and employ small U.S. businesses to the maximum extent practicable in the performance of this contract.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>At this time, the Government does not own a Technical Data Package for the HTVSF design being developed and tested during the JCTD; therefore, the Government cannot release data to non-DoD contractors without the expressed permission of ATK. Furthermore, release of the data necessary to perform this action would destroy the integrity of the competition.</p>
<p>X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION</p>
<p>As discussed in paragraph VI above, this planned action was published in FedBizOpps on 26 Aug 09, and no potential sources expressed interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>During the HTVSF JCTD and rolling down-select process, the HTVSF program office will not solicit further competition; however, the follow-on SDD contract will contain a requirement for the selected contractor to agree to negotiate a price for a TDP or submit a plan to qualify another source should it be unable to complete the production requirements for HTVSF. In that eventuality, the Government will perform market research as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation to support this potential future acquisition.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document provides evidence that this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>As evidenced by the Program Manager's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete.</p>
