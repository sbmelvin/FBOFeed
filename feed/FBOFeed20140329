<DESC>RAD HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAB SYSTEM
SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS
BACKGROUND
Code 105.5 (Radiation Health Division) is requesting a new gamma spectroscopy system to be installed in the new Building 9 annex being constructed by MILCON P320.  The gamma spectroscopy system will replace an existing gamma spectroscopy system that is 10 years old and at the end of its useful life. 
DESCRIPTION
The gamma spectroscopy system is used at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard & IMF (PHNS) to determine the isotope and amount of radioactivity in items and samples.  These results are used to determine if the item or sample can be released from radiological controls. A gamma spectroscopy system is made of many components, that put together provide an accurate measurement of radioactivity.
 All of the following components are required for a complete gamma spectroscopy system for use at PHNS.
•	High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector – This is a special crystal that responds to gamma particles given off by radioactive material.  To be effective, the detectors must be kept at a temperature of approximately minus 200° C. Important aspects of an HPGe detector are its efficiency and ability to distinguish different energy levels given off by radioactive materials as measured by its Full Width Half Mast (FWHM) over a given energy range.  The lower the FWHM the more accurate the detector.
•	Cryostat or Dewar – This is a vacuum insulated vessel designed to house the HPGe detector in a liquid nitrogen bath to maintain the required minus 200° C temperature.
  The vacuum insulated vessel is used to minimize the nitrogen evaporation. 
•	Shield or Cave – The shield surrounds the HPGe detector and the item or sample to minimize background radiation when the item or sample is counted.  This shield must be made of special material to minimize the natural radioactivity of the shield itself and keep the gamma particles given off by the radioactive material within the sealed chamber to react with the HPGe detector.
•	Multi-Channel Analyzer – This analyzer takes the signal from the HPGe and amplifies and process the signal to a digital form that can be analyzed with the proper software.
•	Personnel Computer with gamma spectroscopy software – The gamma spectroscopy software processes the signal, provided via the HPGe and Multi-channel analyzer, using an algorithm that provides a visual readout of the energy spectrum that is used to analyze the data.
  It also identifies the isotope(s) and amount radioactivity in the item or sample.
•	A gamma spectroscopy system operates on standard 110V lines.

Must be NAVSEA approved system NLT contract award, award expected on or before December 2014.  If not compatible with existing system, must provide replacement parts already on-hand.  Contact Technical POC for info on existing system.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.	Contracting Activity: The Department of Veterans Affairs Network Contracting Office, 4811 Airport Plaza Drive, Suite 600 Long Beach, CA has requirement to purchase GEOTAB GPS tracking unit to include all incidental equipment for the GSA leased vehicles and agency owned vehicles as directed by the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System services that require justification for "Other Than Full and Open Competition". The Purchase Request number is 691-14-2-5428-0028. 

2.	Nature and / or Description of Action Being Processed:  The VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System has a need to acquire GEOTAB GPS tracking unit to include all incidental equipment for the GSA leased vehicles and the agency owned vehicles through other than full open competition as authorized by FAR Part 6.302-1 (a) only one responsible source.  The Sprint Communication Company has the exclusive rights to sell the GEOTAB GPS tracking unit and incidental equipment. A GPS tracking unit is a device that uses the Global Positioning System to determine the precise location of a vehicle, person, or other asset to which it is attached and to record the position of the asset at regular intervals.  

3.	Description of Supplies/ Service to Meet Agency's Needs:    GPS systems, such as the Geotab® telematics system, that will be utilized on VA GLA government vehicles, provide the most effective and accurate reporting data. The system will have the capability of reporting mileage and the number of trips for which the vehicle is used. This information is needed to determine if an agency can reduce the number of vehicles it needs to complete its mission. Telematics will also alert the fleet manager when the vehicle is in need of maintenance, thus improving fuel economy as a whole. The real-time vehicle locating function can be used to enhance the security of personnel and property Sprint has exclusive partnership with GEOTAB to sell their GPS tracking System.  


4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: This product is being procured under the authority of 41 USC 253 (C) (1) and FAR Part 6.302-1.  

(X)	(2) Only One Responsible Source and No other Supplies and Services will Satisfy and Agency Requirement per FAR 6.302.-1.
 
5.	Demonstration of Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualification or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority cited Above (Applicability of Authority)   In order to uniformly equip the government vehicle fleet at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, the Sprint/Geotab GPS system is required. Approximately one-half the fleet currently is equipped with this GPS system, and it is important for reporting purposes to have the remainder of the fleet equipped with Geotab. Using one specific reporting system allows the user to run one report as opposed to using two or more GPS reporting systems, which requires multiple reports to gather the same amount of data.  
The estimated cost for this equipment is $70,373.33.00    

6.	Description of Effort made To Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources  As Deem Practicable.   This action was synopsized under solicitation number VA-262-14-Q-0500 as required by FAR Part 5. This was synopsized in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 the statue cited in line #4 above authorizes this action.   It has been determined that there is no other available source for this type of A GPS tracking unit making  Sprint Communication Company the only vendor that can be utilized at this time.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be fair and Reasonable:  Sprint Communication Co. does not currently have a FSS contract for all GEOTAB equipment.   The Government shall receive approximately 14 percent or $10,020.00 discount on the overall listed price.   

8.	Description a Result of Market Research or Statement of the Reasons Market Research was not Conducted: The following search were done internet, Federal Supply Schedule, Past History and the Business Opportunity System (BOS) and no other companies except Sprint Communication Co. were able found to provide the proprietary equipment and software that is required by VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.


10.	List of Other Sources That Expressed Interest in Writing: There are no sources that have expressed an interest in this acquisition.

11.	A Statement of the Action, If any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required:  At this time I know of no other action we may take to overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for these items are required due to the uniqueness of these 

12.	Requirements Certification:   I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
